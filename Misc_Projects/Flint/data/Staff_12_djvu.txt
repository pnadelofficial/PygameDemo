Governor Snyder, 


The recent water concern in the City of Flint has revealed two actions for future drinking water 
shortages. 

In the past, the Flint area has used the National Guard water tanker for local road races. Also, daily 
water tankers fill our local swimming pools. 

When we have large numbers of citizens that must use the "Boil the Water" process, why can't we use 
the tankers I mentioned above? 

Flint has gone days without drinking water. 

With such a basic life need, let's try some possible solutions! We could dispense the water at Senior 
Centers, community gathering locations, neighborhood schools and churches. This could be seen as a 
training experience for the National Guard or Reserves. 

Governor, the need is there and the tankers are at hand. 

Thanks for your time and please let me know what you think. 

I hope this note finds you and your family in fine health.

I have many questions as noted below hut the response should be that they need to work with their 
local EM if they are having these types of issues where state resources are needed and ail ioca! 
resources have been depleted. I had our DC reach out to the Flint EM (not Darnell Early) and the EM 
does not know of any issues as far as people without water or the letter. She is not kept in the loop by 
the county officials. The EM 'was aware of the boil advisory which happens occasionally and she usually 
finds out via the media, it is not appropriate at this time to activate/use the IMG for this --- attached is 
an article where the water advisory was lifted on the 9 th which was the day before the letter was dated 
to the Governor, 

I spoke with the NG and some local NG Armories will support events like road races. The local 
jurisdictions fill out. an event request form and it is reviewed for approval MG HQ may not even know 
about some of the events. Typically this is tied into a recruiting/retention type set up (e.g. 
market/promote the IMG). Additionally, any water tankers or buffaloes need to be certified for potable 
water prior to use by DEQ and at this time we do not believe any are certified, ..but they could be if 
needed, if this is done for this advisory then expect more cities to ask the IMG to provide tankers when 
they have boil advisories. 

Questions: 


-Is this is an emergency? If so, why is the EM not involved and/or requesting this or working to solve the 
issue at the local level? Their job is to find resources. 

-Have they used ail local resources to Include mutual aid and contracts to fulfill the need? 

-The letter indicates there Is a "need" --- does this mean it Is an emergency or inconvenience? 

-How long would the NG be needed? 

-A local Guard Unit supporting a race or other community event is different than providing potable 
water for an entire city. 

-Are they saying the NG fills swimming pools daily (they probably are not but I am pretty sure the NG Is 
not doing this)? If the tankers filling pools are other water tankers from private companies it is up to the 
locals to contract with them if they want to use them but i am not sure the water in those swimming 
pool filling tankers is potable water. This is where the EM should be helping them. 

-Based on conversations and articles read on this issue, the City of Flint removed themselves from 
Detroit water last April and outfitted an old plant that pulls water from the Flint River. The article 
attached Indicates not enough chlorine was getting through the system. ..What are they doing to fix the 
problem? The NG may be a temporary fix but not the Song term solution.

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HFIS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. Fie and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMFISD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DEI FIS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DFI FIS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Introducing Makayla* 



• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last 
week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns. 

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west 
side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with 
warm tap water. 

• Physical exam and development are normal. Makayla 
receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine lead and 
hemoglobin screening. 

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/dL. 


^Hypothetical scenario 


Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL... 


Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are considered 
elevated blood lead levels (EBL) 

Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead level 

Disproportionately impacts low income, minority 
children 

Primary prevention is most important 



Primary Prevention 


• "Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear 
to be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental 
and housing policies should encourage 
PREVENTION of all exposure to lead " 


"Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention " 2012 
CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. 



What will happen to Makayla? 


• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

- Decrease in IQ 

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

- Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low IQs 
(<70) 

• Implications for special education services, employment, 
incarceration, life achievement, etc

pooled analysis. Environ Health Perspect, 2005. 113:894-9.

retardation and cardiovascular diseases from environmental lead 
exposure. Environmental Research, 2004. 94:120-33. 



Behavioral Burden 


Increased likelihood of : 

— ADHD behaviors 

— Delinquent behaviors and arrests 

— Total arrests and increased rates of arrests 
involving violent offenses 

— Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular, 
immunologic, endocrine, etc

The Cost 


"For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as well 
as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) in 
lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure." 


"The present value of Michigan's economic losses attributable to lead 
exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. 
blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per 
year in loss of future lifetime earnings."

Lead in Water 


• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in controlling 
other sources. 

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in water 
sources, disinfectant uses, etc 

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable 
formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers 

— For about 25% o f infants drinking formula made from tap water at 10 
ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5 
micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL). 

- Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights

10.1021/es4034952 



Preliminary Results 



Conclusions from BLL analysis 


% of children with EBL in Flint has increased 

— Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water 
lead levels 

Results underestimate risk: infants not screened 
for lead and water usage unknown. 

— Accurate exposure largely unknown since national 
childhood lead screening focuses on household lead 
exposure (paint, soil, dust) at later ages (1 and 2 yrs) 


Results are consistent and concerning. Primary 
prevention has failed. 



Next Steps

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


® Comments on the corrosion control treatment plan received late in the day on 

October 30 from EPA were addressed, and the letter to the city of Flint regarding 
operational and monitoring conditions related to corrosion control was finalized. 

A PDF of the letter was e-mailed on October 30 to the city of Flint et al. 

• Staff from DLARA and DEQ conducted plumbing assessments at both Brownell 
and Eisenhower Elementary Schools on October 30. Sampling taps were 
identified and labeled. Based on the plumbing assessment, a sampling 
sequence was recommended for each school. 

Additional Actions: 

• DEQ Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian and DEQ Public Information 
Officer Karen Tommasulo met with representatives of DLARA, DFIHS, and city of 
Flint officials, including Mayor Dayne Walling, to discuss progress made since 
the last meeting and to discuss actions to come in the week of November 2. 
Topics included the issuance of a construction permit that would enable the city 
of Flint to provide supplemental phosphate addition to the water coming from 
Detroit. A high level summary regarding the progress of the testing for lead in 
drinking water in the Flint schools was provided with a subsequent discussion by 
the group as a whole. Mayor Walling inquired as to how remediation of the 
schools would be funded, and he was informed that funding was outside the 
purview of the initial assessment. 

• Staff from DEQ and DLARA conducted water sampling at Brownell K-2 STEM 
Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on Saturday, October 31 . In 
addition, staff went back to Freeman Elementary School to pull sequential 
samples as per comments from EPA regarding DEQ’s sampling protocol. The 
sequential samples were also taken at Brownell and Eisenhower. Complete 
sampling protocols have now been conducted at three Flint schools. There were 
a total of 374 samples taken at the three schools on October 31 . 

® As provided by DHHS, the purchased total water filter/pitcher distribution for the 
period of October 6 through October 29 is 9,880 units.

DHHS just advised me there have been discussions with Mick Lyon and the Governor's Office on this issue. DHHS also 
advised me that DEQ. was involved and DHHS would probably be the Public Health Advisor in Flint this 'week ... not sure 
exactly what that will mean, 

F/Lt Covey spoke to Jen Boyer, the Genesee County EM, and reported the following: 

- This is the first she has heard about the Kildee letter. 

- She mentioned that a year ago she was aware of a letter that was 'written to Governor Snyder. 

- To her knowledge, the water in Flint is still meeting EPA standards. 

- She mentioned that the infrastructure {including residential homes) is oid and may be part of the problem, not just 
because water is from the Flint River. 

She believes the city could connect to the county system if needed. 

- The city is supposed to be connecting to a new pipeline from Port Huron in the spring of 2016 which will provide a 
solution, but the city infrastructure will still require repair. 

She reported The Detroit water system knew Flint would one day connect to this new pipeline, so they raised rates 
50%. 

Tomorrow Tony Katarsky will speak with our mitigation offices on potential use of 4195 ($E Ml disaster) mitigation funds 
and if they could be used to assist with infrastructure fixes. There is a 25% local match to the federal funds. 


Attached is the FEMA response to Rep, Kildee. He may not get it for a couple of days but I told FEMA I wanted a copy 
and it just came through. Please hold it within the Governor's Office and this group for situational awareness so we do 
not get ahead of FEMA. FEMA advised him that local or private sector resources would be more expedient and practical.

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

llie Honorable Dan Kildee 
United States House of Representatives 
237 Cannon House Office Building 
Washington, D.€. 20515 


Dear Representative Kildee: 

This is in response to your - letter of September 22, 201.5, to Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA.) Administrator Craig Fugate, as well as the U.S, Department of Health and 
Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection 
Agency, You requested federal assistance to provide safe drinking water to residents of the City 
of Flint, Michigan, until additional testing confirms that the water is safe. Administrator -Fugate 
'requested that 1 respond to you because Michigan, is within FEMA Region V. 

As you may be aware, the Robert T, Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 
Public Law 93-288, as amended, authorises FEMA to provide federal assistance to a state after 
the governor requests that the president issue a disaster declaration and the president approves 
the request because it. has been determined that the severity and. magnitude of the incident 
exceeds local, tribal and state capabilities. If providing safe water to its residents is beyond the 
city’s capability, the city, through Genesee County Emergency Management, should contact the 
Michigan State Police Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, However, 
in this situation, it may be more expedient and practical to pursue water sources from other local 
or private sector entities. 

If you have, questions or would like additional information, please contact me or have a member 
of your staff contact my Congressional Affairs Specialist, Dan Shuhnan, at (312) 41)8-4427. 

Sincerely,

Many thanks, Chris. 

There have been a LOT of conversations and work (and history) on this issue, primarily with both DEO. and DHHS lately, 
and Treasury previously. Sounds like you definitely got a large part of status update and lay of the land. 

Let's touch base tomorrow and can fill you in further. And any insight on any potential use of mitigation funds would be 

incredibly helpful. We'll make sure to keep MSP EMHSD in loop with other state agencies too moving forward as this 

issue and infrastructure challenge isn't going away anytime soon. 

Thanks again,

The latest from Lt Roach. . . 

The County Health Department is expecting to receive 4,000 filters sometime tonight. The 
filters were secured through the United Way and are being trucked in (cost appox $80,000). Lt 
Roach was unable to determine where they are being brought in from. They are hoping to get 
$40,000 more in donations to buy more. The Health Department plans to distribute filters 
tomorrow at 1 :00 pm at UM Flint. The recipients will also be taught how to use filters. Lt 
Roach was told there are approximately 15,000 homes in the city of Flint with corrosive 
distribution pipes. The city water department has a list of the homes with details, but 
information is on paper index cards, not in a database or spreadsheet. They would have to 
manually sort through cards, so this approach is not practical. The current plan is to distribute 
filters by priorities being similar to those used during H1N1 : pregnant women, women breast 
feeding/bottle feeding, residences with and children under 5 years. All must be City of Flint 
residents; credentials will be checked to make sure they are residents and qualify. A WIC list 
may be utilized along with a current list of residences on the lead program The Health 
Department hopes to accomplish work with 15-20 employees and possibly another 20 
volunteers. They plan to distribute using two car lanes to avoid having recipients exit cars. 

No state resources have been requested.

District Coordinator, Lt. Roach, attended meetings today at Genesee Co DHHS and Genesee Co Untied Way referencer 
the continuing problem with Flint's water. The first meeting consisted of DHHS, Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department (GCCARD), Dept, of Human Services, Genesee CO Health Dept., Commission on Aging, Genesee 
County EM Jen Boyer, and a few other county depts. The distribution of filters was the main topic of conversation. Lt. 
Roach learned that so far 20,000 Britta faucet filters were purchased from Home Depot with the million dollars the state 
provided. The filters are in Flint and will be housed at the GCCARD warehouse awaiting distribution. Genesee Co Public 
Health Dept is taking the lead on public messaging/press releases. 

Overall, it was a fairly productive meeting. Everyone from this meeting headed over to the next meeting at the United 
Way in Flint. Reps from the United Way ran the meeting which also included reps from the school district, public 
housing, and one rep, Sean Kammer, Asst to the City Administrator at the City of Flint. Unfortunately, Sean left early 
and requested he be emailed the information. Once again, a fairly productive meeting with distribution being the main 
topic of conversation, the use of volunteer groups to help install filters for elderly clients, school distribution, and public 
education/messaging. Much was worked out for distribution with it starting with priority groups. Attached is a 
summary of the meeting. 

Today, 1800 filters were being distributed to Flint Public Housing including Section 8 housing with the agreement their 
building maintenance will install the filters for those who cannot. Other priority groups should start in the morning. It 
was also requested the UPC codes be blacked out so returns could not be made to Home Depot. Zero Water is providing 
filtered cups for after school activities and athletes. All classrooms will get filtering units with a 24 cup capacity. There 
are talks of filters for all drinking fountains. For those who cannot attach a regular filter to their faucet, ZeroWater 
filtered pitchers are going to be supplied. United Way ordered some today and may be in this week. Under sink filters 
will not be purchased due to cost and potential installment issues. Brita filter pitchers do not meet lead standards so 
they will not be used. 

Jen Boyer has reached out to volunteer groups (CERT, VDF) for help with installments of filters for elderly or special 
needs people. There are also talks by the City of Flint water dept, of connecting outdoor faucets so people can go fill 
jugs for free. This may be decided by the end of the week. This water is good since it isn't going through any 
distribution pipes. Lt. Roach advised there were talks of military water buffalos were brought up for water distribution 
for possibly the next week while the city works on getting their outdoor faucets figured out. I believe there may be 
other alternatives before we do this but I will get the NG as the water buffalos and any water distribution from them 
would need to be certified and that may take a couple days. 

Genesee Co Public Health Dept is taking the PIO lead with help from the PIO from the United Way, Tom 
Wickersham. Tom is a PIO for GM and volunteers for the United Way. 211 will be used as well as some websites to 
advise of distribution points and as well as education. Right now 4 points will be used :2 DHHS offices, and 2 GCCARD 
locations. The Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) is an organization of individuals 
whose overall goal is to eliminate barriers and level the playing field for the poor, seniors, children and the hard to serve 


l 



population of Flint and Genesee County. These opportunities may include pre-school training through our Head Start 
department for the young; receiving additional and/or job training in order to find a permanent job; seeking and finding 
of adequate housing if displaced; receiving of nutritional meals delivered on a daily basis, or receiving home 
improvement repairs when necessary. 

A few areas of concern: lack of participation by the City of Flint government. The representative for Flint left early 
today with really not contributing anything to the effort while he was there. Ginna Holmes (DHHS) knows the Flint 
Mayor and is reaching out to him today ref this issue. The other area is people in the group expecting the state, namely 
Emergency Management, to run the meetings and the event. Lt. Roach explained we will not be running either but will 
participate and be a resource as much as possible. This is a local EM/public health issue unless it is determined we are 
taking the lead. Lt. Roach believes the Co Public Health Dept is going to take a lead role with help from others. Ginna 
Holmes and Jen Boyer will work closely with them along with DHHS. They have another meeting scheduled for Thursday 
at 10:00am at the United Way in Flint and Lt. Roach will be there and we will stay engage to assist. The United Way has 
done a tremendous job so far with this incident according to Lt. Roach. 

Below are some notes on the attached press release reference the filters: 

• Free water filters will be available to current Michigan Department of Health and Human Services clients and 
Flint residents at four locations beginning Tuesday, October 6, at 9 a.m. through a partnership between the

and Human Services clients and Flint residents at four locations beginning Tuesday, October 6, at 
9 a.m. through a partnership between the MDHHS and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. Free National Sanitation Foundation certified water filters are being 
provided to Flint residents as part of the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing 
water concerns in the area. 

Current MDHHS clients are encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office location to obtain a free, certified home water filter. Residents who are not 
currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should visit the Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices located at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. 
Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

“Ensuring that families in the Flint area have access to resources that will help reduce the potential 
for lead exposure is our top priority,” said Nick Lyon, director of the MDHHS. “I want to thank 
our partners who have mobilized to make water filters available - a point that highlights the 
importance of continued collaboration at the local, state and federal level as we move forward.” 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food 
Assistance Program (FAP), Child Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance 
(SDA), or Social Security Insurance (SSI) recipients should bring valid identification and a copy of 
their water bill to their local MDHHS office to receive their filter free of charge. Flint residents 
who are not active MDHHS clients should bring identification and their water bill to the GCCARD 
location. 

Although blood lead levels throughout the city of Flint have remained steady, last week, MDHHS 
data was found to be consistent with a recent Hurley Children’s Hospital study indicating 
increased blood lead levels in children residing in two Flint ZIP codes after a 2014 change in water 
source. While lead paint remains the number one cause of lead poisoning in Michigan, the recent 
data prompted MDHHS to take action to reduce potential lead exposures through water sources. 

MDHHS is urging parents in Flint and throughout the state to do their part in preventing elevated 
blood lead levels in children. For more information about steps you can take now, visit 
www .michi gan . gov/lead , or contact your local health department. For updates on Flint water and

Subject: Flint Water Issue Update from District Coordinator 


Last night I spoke with Lt. Roach to ensure we continued to be engaged at the local level as the Flint water issue 
progresses. She continues to attend the meetings and work with the local EMI and United Way officials. She attended 
the Flint water meeting today at the United Way. AH present watched the Governor’s press conference during the 
meeting. Lt. Roach believes the information from Governor Snyder et al 'was a relief to the group. While all realize much 
work still needs to be done, she felt they are relieved to see a game plan from City Officials and Governor Snyder. There 
was no mention of EMHSD taking over the fiiter distribution like the other day by the United Way, She also asked 
everyone that attended, including reps from the United Way, if they were comfortable and confident with the current 
fiiter distribution method/plan/structure. AH said yes. Additionally, she noted that Sean Kammer , city of Flint, was 
present and stayed for the entire meeting - which did not occur in the past and it was not received well by some at the 
meeting. Kammer also advised U of M was in the process of logging ail the info regarding homes in Flint with lead piping 
into a computer program. The info is currently contained on index cards. That info will be readily accessible in short 
order and can be shared with other depts. I advised Lt Roach that we could assist with G1S needs if it was needed. 

Below is a brief summary from the meeting today: 

•Approximately 6,000 filters have been distributed to Flint residents/public housing through DHHS/GCCard 
•Additional priority groups were identified through 211 calls to the United Way: 

« non-senior homebound - Genesee Co Health Dept is working with hospitals and UofM Flint to get people 
identified and filters delivered 

* college students/international students in off campus housing -■ (some do not change address on driver's 
license to reflect they live in Flint) — Gcard was contacted during the meeting ref this and distribution is being 
worked on 

» no ID residents (some iegal/some iiiegai) - United Way will handle distribution and use filters donated 
« licensed day cares - DHHS will work with LARA to contact and distribute filters 
« non-profits - the United Way will handle 

® GCard advised that homebound seniors should all have received filters by today. Those needing installations are 
using volunteer plumbers and this has become problematic due to liability issues. This issue will continue to be 
worked on, 

® Entering data into the shared distribution spreadsheet is time consuming due to the high volumes of people (This 

is done after distribution). It has caused a few people to receive two filters but that has only happened a few 
times. 

® Zero Water will be providing filters for all Flint schools on Monday - 2500, 23 cup filtered pitchers and a large 
amount of filtered tumblers for After School Programs and athletes. Water donations for schools are high and the 
schools have no more room to store water so the area Food Bank is going to store it for them. A representative 
from Zero Water may be in town Monday 

® There is no mandatory lead testing for schools - 4 Flint schools were recently tested and all were about normal 
testing with 1 being IGGx the accepted limit. Further testing into the schools is going to be conducted. 

* Even with the switch to Detroit water it is unknown what sediments will surface due to the switch. 

® At least 1-2 fiiter cartridge changes are being planned for, however, only 9,000 replacement cartridges/filters are 

available in the entire U.S, United Way has already checked on this. First replacement may be in Dec (or earlier) 
with another possibly in February. 

® 300 filters were distributed to the WIC program 

® Genesee Co Health Dept is working with McLaren Hospital ref lead education so one message is being put out 

* The Flint Mayor is holding a press conference on Monday to update the water situation (not sure where or when 
Monday) 


i 



® Genesee Co Health Dept is working with the Dialysis Center and UofM Flint on getting filters to homebound 
dialysis patients 

There was a Sot of discussion on getting niters to the priority groups listed above but. all groups have someone assigned 
to them to tackle the task. Some seem to think the Mayor is going to announce Monday a new State Agency to help the 
cause or take the lead. Not sure what that is about and no one knew what agency. AH agreed that no matter what 
comes out of the Mayor's announcement Monday they will forge on to get the job done. Overall, a productive meeting 
per It. Roach. 

I have not heard anything reference EMHSD taking on a lead role but we will if needed or requested.

Flint Water Update 


Lt. Roach has provided the following information on the water testing in County Bldgs in Flint. She also 
learned yesterday that some of the initial water testing was done on faucets with aerators - the testing was 
positive for lead. They took the aerators off and found the aerators full of sediment. The same faucets were 
tested again without the aerators - the water tested fine and within lead limits. They are going to check 
drinking fountains in the schools to see if there is something similar in that respect to be causing the elevated 
testing. 

The meeting at the Flealth Dept went well yesterday. They have instituted their ICS and are going to hold daily 
briefings everyday at 1:00pm and email updates/briefings to the partnered agencies. They were to roll this out 
at the meeting today at the United Way so everyone is on the same page. Lt Roach talked at length about 
having daily objectives, briefings, and agencies reporting back on their progress. They talked quite a bit about 
public education. A Fact sheet of lead Q& A’s is currently being developed by Michelle Bruneau, DHHS. 

At this point approx. 8,000 filters have been distributed. Lt. Roach will continue to be engaged on this and 
provide updates.

Filter Tracking System 

® GCHD and Kris Schoenow (MDHHS) are working to expand the cloud-based database to include all needed 
information so that one database can be used to track filter distribution. 

® It is important that the database track the types of filters provided since replacement filters need to be 
distributed to these families in a couple of months.

Declaration Questions 


Paul 

Per your call/question the other day reference a state declaration of an emergency in Flint: 

As you know, the Governor can declare at any time for any reason 

• From PA 390... "Emergency" means any occasion or instance in which the governor determines state assistance is 
needed to supplement local efforts and capabilities to save lives, protect property and the public health and safety, 
or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the state. 

• From the start, the state (EMHSD as well as other state agencies) was engaged and EMSHD continually urged 
officials to work with and through the local EM to coordinate the response and recovery. 

• A local declaration of an emergency was never put in place and local resources were being used in conjunction with 
the DCH. 

• We never received any requests for assistance under PA390. 

What is gained with a Governor's Declaration? 

• Command and control for 28 days 

• Ability to apply Section 19 funding 

• Ability to apply Section 18 funding 

Discussion Points 

• There is no local declaration of an emergency; there is no request for state assistance under PA390. 

o Local resources have been sufficient to address the situation (outside of needing money which I believe is 
being handled). 

• The state will formally own the event if we put a Governor's Declaration in place. This could be viewed as the state 
having owned up to how the water issue was caused (e.g. "The triggering event was caused by the state; that is why 
the state is now declaring."). 

• A state declaration sets a precedent for issuing a state declaration for an infrastructure maintenance event. What if 
lead is found in other areas of the state's drinking water due to infrastructure issues? This action opens the door to 
any other jurisdiction with water quality issues. 

• State financial support has already been provided outside of PA 390, so timing is questionable. 

• Section 18 use could drain the Disaster Contingency Fund. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss or if this is not what you were looking for.

Flint News Article and Update 
12 11 15 City of Flint SOP.PDF 


Note the below article on the Flint water issue. They are starting to follow the emergency management process to 
include implementing their Support Emergency Operations Plan (Flint's is attached). The County has an Emergency 
Operations Plan that Flint is to support. Opening an EOC is key for coordination and that has been done at the city level 
(at least to some degree but probably not at the staffing level it needs to be at this time). 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to consult with the 
county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Picked -- and Michigan State Police once he has been 
given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that the situation is 
beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the county board chair, may then declare a state of emergency 
and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

We are working to make sure we have all the information needed to ensure the Mayor and County Commissioner 
understand the limitations of the Emergency Management Act and Stafford Act. They may find that the energy they are 
spending hoping for a federal emergency declaration may be better spent looking to HUD or EPA for assistance. A 
better job is needed to manage expectations which I will work with others on that. We will also make sure they 
understand what information we would need before we look at a Governor or Presidential declaration. They cannot just 
ask for a Governor's declaration ... they need to provide us information as to why they need it and what they (Flint and 
the County) have done thus far. 

As outlined in the Michigan Emergency Management Plan, Local EM programs must ensure that local disaster relief 
forces are utilized to the maximum extent possible, including the use of local contractors, activation of mutual aid and 
other standing agreements, and use of nearby resources. State disaster assistance is used to supplement local efforts 
and resources, and to help relieve extraordinary burden. It is NOT to be used for simple budgetary relief or to relieve 
hardship. FEMA's first questions will be, "What is it (specifically) they need that they cannot get from others." 


Genesee County chairman says he can send Flint disaster request to governor 

Ron Fonger 

MLive

(This story has been updated with comment from Flint ayor Karen Weaver.) 

FLINT, Ml - Genesee County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jamie Curtis says he is authorized to forward Flint's 
request for a disaster declaration to the governor and plans to meet with Mayor Karen Weaver about it next week. 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to consult with the 
county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and Michigan State Police once he has been 
given the declaration.

Curtis declined to comment further on the matter, but he chairman's letter says he will "do whatever I can ... to assist 
the city of Flint as it continues to struggle with its emergency water situation." 

Weaver said she plans to meet with Curtis and other emergency management officials Monday, Dec. 21, to work on the 
request. 

Earlier this week, Curtis said he did not plan to call a special meeting of the county Board of Commissioners to consider 
the disaster request but would add the issue to the agenda of the county board at its next meeting on Jan. 4. 

The mayor has said state and federal funds are needed to respond to health problems caused by lead in drinking water 
here and to replace thousands of lead service lines in the city. 

Weaver's declaration, read to the City Council Monday, Dec. 14, did not include an estimate of damages suffered by the 
city and residents. 

To support the request for disaster relief, the city also announced that it has enacted its "Support Emergency Operations 
Plan" and opened an "Emergency Operations Center." 

Sean Kammer, assistant to the city administrator, said the center is available to answer questions from residents and will 
be used to coordinate relief efforts. 


The EOC is located in Flint Fire Station 1, 310 E. Fifth St., and the center can be reached by calling 810-237-6888, 
extension 5005 from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN 


I. Purpose 

The City of Flint has elected to be incorporated into the Genesee County Emergency Management 
Program. By becoming part of the county emergency management program, the City of Flint and 
Genesee County have certain responsibilities to each other, This Support Emergency Operations Plan 
has been developed to identify the responsibilities between the City of Flint and Genesee County in 
regards to pre-disaster emergency management activities. It also provides for City of Flint government 
agencies to respond to various types of emergencies or disasters that affect the community. This 
support plan is to be used in concurrence with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guideline, as it 
is a supporting document. The support plan will be maintained in accordance with the most current 
standards of the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. Review of this support plan shall be 
accomplished concurrently with the county plan. 

II. Scope 

This plan is a flexible document in which changes from the content of the plan may occur due to 
unique nature of emergencies. Each agency that has a supported role in this plan or its elements has 
developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which provides systematic instructions for 
accomplishing assigned functions. In addition, to support emergency preparedness and response 
efforts, the local government also conducts other activities such as personnel training, participating in 
exercises, encouraging chronic disease prevention techniques; educate the public on awareness 
activities, and use of appropriate land use planning decisions for mitigation and prevention purposes as 
well. Through this plan, the City of Flint continues to implement the National Incident Management 
System, participating in efforts to provide an effective and efficient incident management operation. 

III. Plan Maintenance and Implementation 

The plan has been developed together with local community, and county officials to ensure 
consistency within the county emergency management program documents. The plan is required to be 
approved by the City of Flint’s Chief Executive Official every four years, or whenever the CEO 
changes and is to be forwarded to the County Emergency Management Office. Upon approval, it will 
be implemented, tested through exercises in concurrence with County officials, and review/updated to 
maintain currentness with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. 

This plan has been provided to all municipal agencies, elected officials, the county emergency 
management office and the MSP/EMHSD district coordinator. 

IV. Emergency Management Program Oversight 

The City of Flint has appointed the Chief of Fire to serve as the city’s emergency management liaision 
responsible for working with the County Emergency Management Coordinator in matters pertaining to 
emergency management for the municipality. Pursuant the requirements in P.A. 390, of 1976, as 
amended, Section 19, Genesee County has adopted a resolution that incorporates the City of Flint into 
its emergency management program, necessary for diaster assistance.

CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN 


BASIC INFORMATION 


I. Community Profile 

The City of Flint is situated in the center of Genesee County. At 33.42 square miles, it is the county’s 
largest city. According to the United States Census Bureau, Flint’s estimated population is 99,763. 

Flint has an average number of people identified as individuals with special/functional needs for a 
city of its size. Many of these individuals reside in congregate care centers, but others reside in non- 
group homes where help is provided as needed or on-call. 

According to the Genesee County Hazard Mitigation Plan, the three situations the community is most 
vulnerable to is: inclement weather (e.g. thunderstorms, hail, lightning and severe wind storms, snow, 
tornadoes), structure fires and hazardous material incidents. All of these incidents can happen 
anywhere within the community, but hazardous material incidents are more likely to occur on the 
major expressways and highways. 1-475, 1-69, M-21 & M-54 all pass through Flint while 1-75/US 23 is 
very close to its western border. More information regarding hazard vulnerability can be found in the 
County’s Hazard Mitigation Plan/ Analysis. 

Within the community, there are 19 sites that contain extremely hazardous materials. Pursuant to 
SARA Title III, off-site emergency response plans have been developed by the LEPC to prepare the 
fire department(s) to respond to the specific hazardous materials on the sites. In addition, the owners 
of the site(s) have reported the types of hazardous material that is housed on-site, as required by the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act. 

II. Emergency Management Authority 

Pursuant to P.A. 390 of 1976, as amended, the municipal CEO may declare a local state of emergency 
for the City of Flint. Also, Sections 1-801 and 3-306 of the Flint City Charter describe procedures 
regarding emergency luies and ordinances. Upon a declaration, PA 390 also authorizes the CEO to 
issue directives, such as restrictions to travel on local roads. The local declaration activates this 
emergency plan as well as the emergency operations center to conduct activities to ensure the safety of 
people, property, and the environment. 

Since the City of Flint has been a recipient of federal preparedness assistance, a resolution has been 
adopted by the local government for establishing the National Incident Management System as the 
standard for incident management for all-hazards. Through the adoption, the City continues to 
implement the concepts of the NIMS through training, planning, and exercising activities. 

III. Response Resources 

The City of Flint maintains fulltime departments of both Police and Fire. They are responsible for 
providing public safety and welfare to the community. Each department is comprised of qualified 
emergency personnel, and maintains equipment capable of responding to emergencies. A list of 
resources that the departments use for emergency situations can be requested through the municipal 
emergency management liaison. Under certain circumstances, if the incident requires additional 
resources beyond the capability of the City of Flint, the CEO may enact mutual aid. This is a familiar 
practice within both departments. 


2 



IV. Emegency Management Organization 


The City of Flint emergency management organization consists of a number of departments 
responsible for conducting activities in response to emergencies within the community. These 
departments have been assigned to specific emergency functions for which the municipality has 
identified necessary in order to provide an effective response to secure the safety of people, property, 
and the environment. Each agency is responsible for implementing pre-disaster activities to help 
prevent and/or prepare for various hazards that the community is vulnerable to such as: chronic 
diseases, flooding, hazardous material spills, inclement weather, tornadoes, and public disturbance to 
name a few; a more profound list can be found in the County's Hazard Mitigation Plan/Analysis. 
Prevention and preparedness activities include: awareness training, exercising, hygienic practices to 
prevent spreading of infectious diseases, stockpiling equipment, and educating people on how to care 
for themselves during an emergency. 

The CEO serves as the incident manager for municipal coordination. At his/her side includes the 
Finance Director and the Emergency Management Liaison (EML). The EML’s duties include 
planning, operations, and logistics. 

The table lists the functions, assigned agencies, primary point of contact of municipal EOC

Subject: Recommendation for Governor's Declaration of an Emergency 

Importance: High 


Paul 

On January 4, 2016, Genesee County requested that a "State of Emergency/Disaster" be issued by Governor Snyder. I 
have reviewed the situation with key EMHSD staff and we conclude that a recommendation for declaration of a State of 
Emergency is warranted based on the following factors: 

• The situation is sufficiently widespread and severe. 

• The situation adversely impacts public health, safety and welfare. The presence of lead in drinking water has 
been documented. The full extent and required remediation remain unknown. 

• The potential fiscal impact to the city of Flint is severe. The current situation poses an extraordinary financial 
burden. 

• The city and county do not possess the technical expertise to fully identify impacts and remediation. 

EMHSD also recommends activation of the SEOC which will include: 

• Attendance by all state agencies; 

• Situation Reports by all state agencies for situational awareness and to develop a common operating picture; 

• Technical briefings by MDEQ and MDHHS on the situation. 

Following initial SEOC briefings, state agencies must determine (in consultation with the state director of EMHS) if they 
need to play a role in ongoing SEOC operations to contribute to addressing the Flint water issue. At minimum, the 
following agencies should maintain a presence in the SEOC during the operational period: MDEQ, MDHHS, Ml 
Department of Education, DTMB, Department of Talent and Economic Development, and MDARD. The SEOC 
operational period is to be determined but will at minimum be 8-5 Monday through Friday. 

The initial focus of the SEOC will be to: 

• Identify and implement any needed protective actions to protect public health and safety; 

• Develop situational awareness and common operating picture; 

• Develop understanding of technical aspects; 

• Coordinate damage assessment; 

• Review resource requests; 

• Coordinate public information; and 

• Identify programs to assist in remediating damage. 

Finally, EMHSD staff recommends: 

• Activation of a Joint Information Center located in Flint which must include PIOs from Genesee County, the city 
of Flint, and other appropriate local agencies to participate. 

ACTION ITEM: The Governor's Declaration of an Emergency is being drafted and will be initiated pending the 
Governor's approval of this recommendation and above actions.

We have looked at this a few times so please double check it. A few notes: 

• I removed the reference we had to a public health emergency as DHHS advised me there really 
is no such thing. 

• The Oct. 1 date is what we used in the 7 th paragraph (that is when they declared a "public health 
emergency"). This date was also reference in Flints IAP they wrote. 

• If signed today, we are including todays date in the 28 day timeframe this would be in effect

CITY OF FLINT 

INCIDENT ACTION PLAN 

STATE OF EMERGENCY 


Objectives: 


To provide short term relief and long term solutions in addressing the man-made emergency of 
increased lead levels in the City of Flint (the "City") water system resulting from the switch to Flint River 
as the City's water source as well as the threat to public health related to elevated blood lead levels in 
Flint residents, without interruption of the provision of public safety and other essential public services. 
Due to the fluidic nature of emergencies and the complexity of the City of Flint's declared emergency, 
this plan serves as a framework and may be altered as the emergency develops. 

The Response Framework 

The purpose of this plan is to organize efforts on behalf of the city to assess the extent of the City's 
infrastructure needs and risks to public health, provide immediate relief to those who are at risk, and 
establish long term solutions. In addition, the city must ascertain what immediate relief and long term 
solutions the City is capable of implementing based on what resources are available. For any activities 
that are beyond the resource capacity of the City, external sources of funding, supplies, and manpower 
must be sought. 

There are a number of steps that must be taken in accordance with the Flint Emergency Support 
Operations Plan (SEOP), in order for the City to be compliant with the Genesee County Emergency 
Action Guidelines. These include the activation of the Incident Management Team, the Emergency 
Operation Center, and the sharing of essential documents with the County, including this plan. 
Information must also be shared by the City's Public Information Officer on a regular basis, as required 
by the SEOP. 

This plan calls for the provision of immediate relief to those at risk in our community. Special 
consideration must be given to residents who belong to underserved groups, such as those who are 
homebound, undocumented, in poverty, etc. Additional consideration must also be given to the 
equitable provision of services throughout our community in order to equally protect the health and 
safety of every member of our community. 

Implementation of this plan is to be conducted by the Incident Management Team, which will monitor 
the effective delivery of goods and services in order to address the conditions of the emergency. 

Understanding the Issue: 

October 1, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a Public Health Emergency after 
elevated blood-lead levels were found among children in the City of Flint. This incident correlates with 
elevated levels of lead found in the City's drinking water after the City switched water sources in April of 


2014 to the Flint River. The scope of this problem appears to be limited to Flint City Water Customers 
and their dependents. Public agencies from several levels of government, as well as charitable, nonprofit 
organizations have partnered with the City to provide immediate relief to Flint residents, including the 
expansion of health services, the provision of bottled water and NSF rated water filters. The city is also 
seeking long term infrastructure improvements to eliminate lead and other contaminants from the 
water system. 

Gov. Rick Snyder appointed a task force to review "actions regarding water use and testing in Flint" and 
to make recommendations for future guidelines: Members of the state task force are Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants, Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council, Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center. 

In an effort to halt the further escalation of this crisis, the City returned to receiving its water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) on October 16, 2015. Since that time, additional 
corrosion control program has started, estimating a reduction of lead levels over the next six months. In 
light of these efforts, concerns surrounding the quality of water and health of the residents persist to 
the point that Mayor Karen Weaver declared a State of Emergency on December 14, 2015 so as to 
resolve this crisis once and for all. 

The current challenge facing the City is providing immediate relief and long term solutions of the quality 
of the water and health of residents while the City remains in a financially critical condition. It is hoped 
and expected that higher levels of government recognize this emergency as it pertains to the condition 
of the City's infrastructure and health of its residents, and do all things necessary to assist the City in the 
provision of relief and the execution of capital improvement projects that will eliminate the causes of 
this emergency. 

Enhancing Understanding: 

Information Collection 

Essential Elements of Information (EEls) can be qualified as the City's water tests containing lead results, 
the verification of lead water lines (both public and private), and health information. Water testing is 
performed by the City's water plant in cooperation with the MDEQ.. The verification of lead water lines is 
being handled by University of Michigan Flint, who is currently digitizing the City's water line 
information and PSI Engineering, who is initiating the effort to verify lead lines by excavating an initial 
150 residential lines. This information allows the Incident Management Team to assess the current 
condition of the emergency by way of determining the water quality and the condition of the water 
distribution infrastructure. 


Information Analysis 

The City has sought partners to assist in the analysis and attenuation of complex data. Wayne State 
University's center for Urban Studies has agreed to assist the City in its efforts to document and track 
lead water lines, water test results, and filter distribution with geographic information system (GIS) 
technology. This allows for easily updateable, digestible information to be presented to officials. 

Assessment of Impacts 

The City will need assistance in determining the total cost of damage done to the public health and 
infrastructure. As of now, only portions of this damage are visible. 

PSI is providing some assistance by excavating 150 residential water lines to verify that they are 
comprised of lead. This is an initial step, but not enough. More resources will be needed to continue this 
process. 

Continuous Situational Awareness 

It is important that the Emergency Management Team receive continuous information regarding water 
testing results, lead water line numbers, and filter distribution information in order to gain a realistic 
and current perspective. Much of his information is currently available on the City's website 
(cityofflint.com) and more is added each week by the PIO team. 

Actions taken in Response to the Emergency 

Activation of the Incident Management Team 

Upon the declaration of Emergency by Mayor Weaver, the Support Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP) 
was activated. The SEOP calls upon the Incident Management Team to generate the Incident Action Plan 
(IAP. Each member of this team serves a specific function as it relates to addressing the causes and 
effects of the emergency. The Emergency Management Team roster can be found in the SEOP on page 
3, with a list of alternates on page 4 in case the need for succession arises. 

Emergency Operations Center 

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) must be activated upon the declaration of a State of 
Emergency by the Mayor. This center is required by the SEOP and serves as a nerve center for the 
Incident Management Team. Here, emergency relief efforts are coordinated by key members of the 
Incident Management Team. In this case, these relief efforts consist of the distribution of water filters at 



City Hall and community events, the distribution of bottled water throughout the city in conjunction 
with the efforts of community partners, and assisting with the circulation of water testing kits 
throughout the community. The EOC will also be monitoring and managing the inventory of relief 
supplies, such as water filters and bottled water. 

According to the SEOP, the EOC must establish an incident tracking system. This system will serve as a 
work plan for the management of the emergency. In addition, it is essential that the IMT record water 
testing results, lead water line location information, and information about the distribution of water 
filters and bottled water all in one place so that information is readily available for the Incident 
Management Team. This information will also be sent out to the public and media in the form of daily 
regular updates by the City's PIO. 

Communication 

The EOC maintains a telephone system that exists to intake questions about relief efforts and to 
organize relief logistics. It is open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. A voicemail system and 
eventual email system will exist to handle requests and inquiries that occur outside of the normal 
operating hours. This system will be constructed by the City's IS department. 

Public Awareness and Education 

1. Emergency Alerts and Updates: 

The City's Public Information Officer will make available information as it relates to the 
emergency in the form of press releases, emails, and physical documents. Daily updates 
containing information on the distribution of water filters, bottled water, water testing, blood 
lead testing, and other relief efforts will be available on the City's website for the public to view. 
Information will be available at City Hall for residents. 

2. Joint Information Center: 

The City's PIO will establish a joint Information Center that is organized to coordinate the efforts 
of multiple agencies to communicate with the public. This includes the circulation of joint press 
releases, public health information, educational materials, and updates relating to the State of 
Emergency. This committee is comprised of public information officers and public relations 
personnel to coordinate efforts to keep the public updated and informed. Regular updates to 
the media regarding events and progress will be made as news develops. 

The US EPA has offered assistance in the form of Public Information support. Additional support 
in this area has been provided by the Michigan State Police. 


3. Education: 

Many government agencies and philanthropic organizations are already distributing information 
regarding the effects of lead on public health. It is important that the City assist in these efforts 
so vital information and knowledge is presented to all members of the community. The goal is to 
continue to eliminate misunderstandings and incorrect information as it relates to reducing lead 
in drinking water, pursuing medical help, and maintaining a healthy diet to reduce lead 
absorption in the body. Lead education is currently being performed by the Genesee County 
Health Department, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Medical 
community at-large. 


Assessment of Social Needs 

In order to effectively and equitably provide immediate relief to Flint water customers, the City must 
take into account many of the socio-economic needs and limitations of the community. Some residents 
cannot get to City Hall for a water filter. Some residents do not have internet access. Literacy or a 
language barrier may also pose significant obstacles to the effective distribution of educational 
information and relief to those in need. These will be continuing challenges facing the community. At 
present these are the resources the City has available to mitigate some of those challenges. 

Logistics 


Logistics are being coordinated by the City Emergency Management Team's City's Chief Logistics Officer, 
who is the City Administrator. The CLO is responsible for the coordination, procurement, and 
transportation of goods and services, which is essential for effective implementation of the response 
plan. 

Fixed Distribution Points 

There are several locations throughout the city where residents may acquire a water filter. These 
locations are: 


Flint City Hall 

1101 South Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 

Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) 

601 North Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502

Mobile Distribution Centers 

With the help of transportation agencies, like the Metro Transit Authority (MTA), meals on wheels, and 
GCCARD, the city can help establish mobile distribution centers and delivery systems that can provide 
water filters, bottled water, and nutritious foods, among other types of relief accompanied by 
educational materials to neighborhoods and to homes of people who experience limited mobility. 

• Mass Transportation Authority-MTA bus passes: Assisting residents with bus passes to 
improve their mobility will increase their chances of receiving help. Transportation 
services will also improve residents' access to medical care. 

• MTA-Your Ride mobile distribution: 

0 Estimated Costs: $25 per hour to deliver water and filters to homes throughout 
the City. 

Problem 1. Public Health Emergency 

The first objective in addressing this emergency is reducing, and eventually eliminating, the danger to 
public health. As City water coming out of faucets continue to contain lead, and copper and other 


7 


































harmful contaminants exceeding government guidelines and regulations, it poses a risk to the people of 
our community. Preventative measures must be taken to avoid the effects of toxicosis that are difficult if 
not impossible to completely reverse. 

As far as preventative measures are concerned, education, water filters, and bottled water must be 
provided to every household in the City in order to reduce the chances of lead exposure, especially to 
our most vulnerable members of the community. If lead exposure has occurred, resulting in elevated 
blood lead levels, immediate and sustained medical attention must be available to those affected. 

Health services must be expanded in the area to accommodate increased numbers of case loads and 
specialized care regarding lead poisoning and its effects. 

Immediate Relief for Public Health: 

1. Prevention: Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing, and bottled 
water must be available to everyone. 

2. Access to nutritious food that reduces the risks of lead absorption by the body. The City can 
coordinate activities with the County Health Department 

Long Term Solutions: Maintaining Public Health and Coping with Lead Exposure 

1. Work closely with the Genesee County Health Department and Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services in order to provide sustainable care and monitoring of children exposed to 
lead. This care must be available for them for several years-preferably several decades. 

2. Support and education for primary care providers regarding aggressive long-term 
neurodevelopmental screening and testing. 

3. Improved access to developmental and behavioral (DBP) specialists, pediatric psychologists, 
pediatric psychiatrists. 

a. Pre-emptive referral to mental health/ toxic stress screenings. 

b. Support capacity building and or incentivize recruitment to allow Genesee health system 
(CMH) to build this capacity which is currently needed and lacking. 

4. Increase recognition and education regarding trauma informed care, social determinants of 
health (SDOH). 

5. Expand State funded Genesee Health System (CMH) services. 

a. Infant mental health (30 day capacity) 

b. Child case management 

c. Home based services 

d. Trauma informed care- trauma focused CBT 

Problem 2. Lead Contamination in the Water 
Immediate Relief: 


1. Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing for water customers, and 
bottled water must be available to everyone. Water filters can be obtained at any of the fixed 
distribution points throughout the City. 

2. Identification and verification of lead water service lines throughout the city- both public and 
private. 

3. Assistance to identify lead pipes within buildings and homes. 

Distribution of Bottled Water: 

At this point, we are directing all offers for donations to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan. It is 
imperative that water be accessible to all members of the community through a variety of distribution 
channels. These channels are explained in the Logistics Section of this plan. 

Distribution of Test Bottles: 

Water testing kits can be picked up at City Hall with instructions. Test results are posted on the City's 
website to raise public awareness and encourage more participation. 

Long term Solutions: Capital Improvements Needs 

The distribution of filters, water, and food to counter the effects of lead are essential response efforts to 
keep people safe. However, long term solutions are required to keep people healthy, to eliminate lead 
from the public and private water distribution system distribution, and to provide affordable clean 
water. Our public infrastructure and utilities must be reliable, sustainable, and equitable in order for this 
community to rebound after this emergency. The following long term solutions must be implemented in 
order to set the City of Flint on a course for recovery. These solutions come at a heavy cost for a City 
that is currently in receivership. The City has experienced financial distress due to this Emergency, in 
addition to a two million dollar loss from switching back to DWSD. The City has diligently applied for 
Fiscally Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships, Grant in order to supplement funding for capital 
improvement projects. It is essential that these grants be awarded in order to achieve long term 
solutions. 

1. COUPLETS Transition to a Temporary Safe Water Source until the Completion of KWA: 

This has already occurred. On October 16, 2015, Flint returned to receiving its water from DWSD 
on a 9 month agreement. This agreement will expire in June 2016, when the KWA is projected to 
be complete. The City had to pay $2 million out of its general fund to make this switch. 

2, UN PROGRESS Additional Corrosion Control added to the Water System: 


This is already occurring. In early December, 2015, Flint began to add additional corrosion 
control to the water coming in from DWSD in attempts to rebuild the protective scale inside its 
pipes. This is estimated to reduce lead levels in two to six months. 

3. Faucet Replacement: 

Replacement of Water faucets, and drinking fountains in the school system. It has been 
determined after state inspections that many sources of lead contamination in the School 
System's water were the faucets themselves. These faucets need to be replaced. 

4. Water Line Replacement: 

Water Line Replacement to reduce antiquated infrastructure and lead service lines. These lines 
must be identified, verified, and replaced. Residents who are facing financial hardships must 
have access to assistance to cover the costs of these replacements through access to grants and 
(forgivable) loans made available through State and Federal agencies. The corrosion damage to 
public and private lines that Flint River water caused is still being determined. 

• Replacement of an estimated fifteen thousand (15,000) lead service lines at an 

estimated cost of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per line. Total costs forty -five million 
dollars ($45,000,000). This project is estimated to be one of the most cost-intensive 
endeavors related to ameliorating water contaminants. 

5. Reimbursement of Critical Expenditures: 

Seeking reimbursement of two million dollar cost of returning to DWSD and forgiveness of 
Water Revolving Loan Debt from the State of Michigan. 


6. KWA Capital Improvements: The City has reconnected to Detroit temporarily until a water line 
from Port Huron is developed. The new water line known as the KWA pipeline or Karegnondi 
Water Authority is expected to bring water to the City from Lake Huron by July. The current cost 
agreement between Flint and DWSD is for nine months, therefore it is imperative that KWA be 
completed as soon as possible. Assistance relating to capital improvements to expedite this 
process will help to achieve long term goals. 


KWA Capital Improvements: 

a. Transfer Station to Dort Reservoir 

b. Raw water line to pump station #4 

c. Phosphoric acid feed system 

d. Alum Feed system 

e. Post filtration system 


Estimated Costs: 

$4,500,000 

$636,000 

$186,000 

$40,000 

$387,289 


/. SCADA Upgrades 
g. Sewer Relining 

Total 


$424,000 

$100,000 

$6,273,289 


Ancillary Considerations: Public Safety during an Emergency 

During a time of emergency public safety agencies need to be prepared to respond to threats to public 
safety and critical infrastructure. The City is facing a man-made emergency that is threatening the public 
health. Resentment and hostility toward local institutions and municipal government is at a significant 
level. 

Critical infrastructure should be safeguarded if the need arises. This includes increasing security at City 
Hall to reduce potential for public safety risks. In the case of credible threats to public infrastructure, it 
may be required to hire private security company for first line of defense. Private Security is lower cost, 
thereby making it the first option. The minimum response is acted upon first, elevating only if the need 
arises. Credible or imminent threats of damage or destruction to critical infrastructure requires an 
elevated response. Such needs may require over-time police officers to address critical situations. 
Mutual aid from surrounding communities can be requested if Flint public safety is overextended. 

Implementation: 

Community Partners 

Financial limitations of the city persist while it confronts this emergency. Many community partners 
have offered their assistance to perform various needed functions. The city is heavily reliant on the 
assistance that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have provided. 

The Mott Foundation 

The Mott Foundation has provided financial assistance, especially in their generous contribution of $4 
million. In addition, the Mott Foundation has recently pledged an additional 

United Way 

The Genesee County United Way has provided significant financial assistance in the way of purchasing 
and helping to distribute water filters since the public health emergency began on October 1 st , 2015. 

Genesee County Community Action Resources Department (GCCARD) 


11 


GCCARD is organized to fight poverty and has been a primary partner in the distribution of water filters. 
It has also regularly supported the city with the logistics and availability of water filters at City Hall. 

Genesee County Health Department 

Has provided educational information to Flint Water customers 

Genesee County Board of Commissioners 

The Board of Commissioners have pledged their support to help Flint seek solutions to this crisis. The 
Board has already assisted in making health and nutrition information available to the public. 

Assistance from Wayne State University 

Wayne State University's Center for Urban Studies will be providing technical GIS support to assist in the 
documentation of emergency relief efforts. 

The US Environmental Protection Agency 

Region 5 EPA has offered assistance with Public Information distribution during the emergency. 

Outside Help is still needed... 

The City of Flint is forever thankful to our community partners who have given so much to help so many 
people. However the magnitude of this emergency calls for more resources that are beyond the capacity 
of the combined local organizations and government agencies. Long term solutions will require a heavy 
investment in health care and capital improvement projects to upgrade the city's antiquated water 
distribution system. 

• Help with Immediate Relief in terms of assuring allocative efficiency. Distribution should 
be equitable- assistance from other governments required to assure this. 

• Reaching communities for the distribution of water filters, water, and educational 
materials. 

• Help with Water Testing to increase participation and lead education. 

• Increasing the rate of water testing 

• Assistance is required to fund essential capital improvement projects to guarantee clean 
and safe water.

We have looked at this a few times so please double check it. A few notes: 

• I removed the reference we had to a public health emergency as DHHS advised me there really 
is no such thing. 

• The Oct. 1 date is what we used in the 7 th paragraph (that is when they declared a "public health 
emergency"). This date was also reference in Flints IAP they wrote. 

• If signed today, we are including todays date in the 28 day timeframe this would be in effect 
which would put the 28 lh day on February 1, 2016.

The latest from Lt Roach... 


The County Health Department is expecting to receive 4,000 filters sometime 
tonight. The filters were secured through the United Way and are being trucked 
in (cost appox $80,000). Lt Roach was unable to determine where they are being 
brought in from. They are hoping to get $40,000 more in donations to buy 
more. The Health Department plans to distribute filters tomorrow at 1 :00 pm at 
UM Flint. The recipients will also be taught how to use filters. Lt Roach was 
told there are approximately 15,000 homes in the city of Flint with corrosive 
distribution pipes. The city water department has a list of the homes with details, 
but information is on paper index cards, not in a database or spreadsheet. They 
would have to manually sort through cards, so this approach is not practical. The 
current plan is to distribute filters by priorities being similar to those used during 
H1N1: pregnant women, women breast feeding/bottle feeding, residences with 
and children under 5 years. All must be City of Flint residents; credentials will be 


l 



checked to make sure they are residents and qualify. A WIC list may be utilized 
along with a current list of residences on the lead program The Health 
Department hopes to accomplish work with 15-20 employees and possibly 
another 20 volunteers. They plan to distribute using two car lanes to avoid having 
recipients exit cars. 

No state resources have been requested.

? The School Board President has been joining the meetings at the United Way and discussions 
with contacts at private and charter schools are occurring to supply them with filters. 

? GCHD advised that they will proceed with a daily briefing at 4:00PM. 

Filter Tracking System 

? GCHD and Kris Schoenow (MDHHS) are working to expand the cloud-based database to include 
ail needed information so that one database can be used to track filter distribution. 

? It is important that the database track the types of filters provided since replacement fil ters 
need to be distributed to these families in a coupie of months. 

? The database will be used to cross reference the list of kids with elevated blood levels to ensure 
these households receive filters. 

MDHHS Update: 

Protocol for Identifying and Prioritizing Children that Require Testing and Case Management 

? 151 children from all Flint zip codes have been identified with previous blood lead levels of 5 or 

over since April, 2014. 

? 85% of the children are Hurley patients. 92% of the children receive Medicaid. 

? 75 of the children need venous draws; 76 need venous retesting. 

? Eden Wells, Rashmi Travis, Haney Peeler, Toni LaRocco (GCHD) and Dr. Gary Johnson (GCHD) will 
work together to develop the testing and case management protocols. 


l 



? Possible completion date of protocol by October 14 th . 

? U of M Flint and McLaren Health are interested in assisting with capillary lead testing. Public 
health students can also assist as needed. 

? Training may be needed on the protocols and data reporting. 

? Tit ere was discussion about parental requests to test older children. The risk based protocol wil 
be customized given the situation.

Note the below article on the Flint water issue. They are starting to follow the emergency management 
process to include implementing their Support Emergency Operations Plan (Flint's is attached). The 
County has an Emergency Operations Plan that Flint is to support. Opening an EOC is key for 
coordination and that has been done at the city level (at least to some degree but probably not at the 
staffing level it needs to be at this time). 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to 
consult with the county's emergency management coordinator - Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and 
Michigan State Police once he has been given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that 
the situation is beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the county board chair, may then 
declare a state of emergency and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor’s 
declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

We are working to make sure we have all the information needed to ensure the Mayor and County 
Commissioner understand the limitations of the Emergency Management Act and Stafford Act. They 
may find that the energy they are spending hoping for a federal emergency declaration may be better 
spent looking to HUD or EPA for assistance. A better job is needed to manage expectations which I will 
work with others on that. We will also make sure they understand what information we would need 
before we look at a Governor or Presidential declaration. They cannot just ask for a Governor's 
declaration ... they need to provide us information as to why they need it and what they (Flint and the 
County) have done thus far. 


As outlined in the Michigan Emergency Management Plan, Local EM programs must ensure that local 
disaster relief forces are utilized to the maximum extent possible, including the use of local contractors, 
activation of mutual aid and other standing agreements, and use of nearby resources. State disaster 
assistance is used to supplement local efforts and resources, and to help relieve extraordinary burden. It 
is NOT to be used for simple budgetary relief or to relieve hardship. FEMA's first questions will be, "What 
is it (specifically) they need that they cannot get from others." 




Genesee County chairman says he can send Flint disaster request to governor

(This story has been updated with comment from Flint ayor Karen Weaver.) 

FLINT, Ml -- Genesee County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jamie Curtis says he is authorized to 
forward Flint's request for a disaster declaration to the governor and plans to meet with Mayor Karen 
Weaver about it next week. 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to 
consult with the county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Pickell — and Michigan 
State Police once he has been given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that 
the situation is beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the the county board chair, may 
then declare a state of emergency and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's 
declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

Curtis declined to comment further on the matter, but he chairman's letter says he will "do whatever I 
can ... to assist the city of Flint as it continues to struggle with its emergency water situation." 

Weaver said she plans to meet with Curtis and other emergency management officials Monday, Dec. 21, 
to work on the request. 

Earlier this week, Curtis said he did not plan to call a special meeting of the county Board of 
Commissioners to consider the disaster request but would add the issue to the agenda of the county 
board at its next meeting on Jan. 4. 

The mayor has said state and federal funds are needed to respond to health problems caused by lead in 
drinking water here and to replace thousands of lead service lines in the city. 

Weaver's declaration, read to the City Council Monday, Dec. 14, did not include an estimate of damages 
suffered by the city and residents. 

To support the request for disaster relief, the city also announced that it has enacted its "Support 
Emergency Operations Plan" and opened an "Emergency Operations Center." 

Sean Kammer, assistant to the city administrator, said the center is available to answer questions from 
residents and will be used to coordinate relief efforts. 

The EOC is located in Flint Fire Station 1, 310 E. Fifth St., and the center can be reached by calling 810- 
237-6888, extension 5005 from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN 


I. Purpose 

The City of Flint has elected to be incorporated into the Genesee County Emergency Management 
Program. By becoming part of the county emergency management program, the City of Flint and 
Genesee County have certain responsibilities to each other, This Support Emergency Operations Plan 
has been developed to identify the responsibilities between the City of Flint and Genesee County in 
regards to pre-disaster emergency management activities. It also provides for City of Flint government 
agencies to respond to various types of emergencies or disasters that affect the community. This 
support plan is to be used in concurrence with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guideline, as it 
is a supporting document. The support plan will be maintained in accordance with the most current 
standards of the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. Review of this support plan shall be 
accomplished concurrently with the county plan. 

II. Scope 

This plan is a flexible document in which changes from the content of the plan may occur due to 
unique nature of emergencies. Each agency that has a supported role in this plan or its elements has 
developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which provides systematic instructions for 
accomplishing assigned functions. In addition, to support emergency preparedness and response 
efforts, the local government also conducts other activities such as personnel training, participating in 
exercises, encouraging chronic disease prevention techniques; educate the public on awareness 
activities, and use of appropriate land use planning decisions for mitigation and prevention purposes as 
well. Through this plan, the City of Flint continues to implement the National Incident Management 
System, participating in efforts to provide an effective and efficient incident management operation. 

III. Plan Maintenance and Implementation 

The plan has been developed together with local community, and county officials to ensure 
consistency within the county emergency management program documents. The plan is required to be 
approved by the City of Flint’s Chief Executive Official every four years, or whenever the CEO 
changes and is to be forwarded to the County Emergency Management Office. Upon approval, it will 
be implemented, tested through exercises in concurrence with County officials, and review/updated to 
maintain currentness with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. 

This plan has been provided to all municipal agencies, elected officials, the county emergency 
management office and the MSP/EMHSD district coordinator. 

IV. Emergency Management Program Oversight 

The City of Flint has appointed the Chief of Fire to serve as the city’s emergency management liaision 
responsible for working with the County Emergency Management Coordinator in matters pertaining to 
emergency management for the municipality. Pursuant the requirements in P.A. 390, of 1976, as 
amended, Section 19, Genesee County has adopted a resolution that incorporates the City of Flint into 
its emergency management program, necessary for diaster assistance.

CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN 


BASIC INFORMATION 


I. Community Profile 

The City of Flint is situated in the center of Genesee County. At 33.42 square miles, it is the county’s 
largest city. According to the United States Census Bureau, Flint’s estimated population is 99,763. 

Flint has an average number of people identified as individuals with special/functional needs for a 
city of its size. Many of these individuals reside in congregate care centers, but others reside in non- 
group homes where help is provided as needed or on-call. 

According to the Genesee County Hazard Mitigation Plan, the three situations the community is most 
vulnerable to is: inclement weather (e.g. thunderstorms, hail, lightning and severe wind storms, snow, 
tornadoes), structure fires and hazardous material incidents. All of these incidents can happen 
anywhere within the community, but hazardous material incidents are more likely to occur on the 
major expressways and highways. 1-475, 1-69, M-21 & M-54 all pass through Flint while 1-75/US 23 is 
very close to its western border. More information regarding hazard vulnerability can be found in the 
County’s Hazard Mitigation Plan/ Analysis. 

Within the community, there are 19 sites that contain extremely hazardous materials. Pursuant to 
SARA Title III, off-site emergency response plans have been developed by the LEPC to prepare the 
fire department(s) to respond to the specific hazardous materials on the sites. In addition, the owners 
of the site(s) have reported the types of hazardous material that is housed on-site, as required by the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act. 

II. Emergency Management Authority 

Pursuant to P.A. 390 of 1976, as amended, the municipal CEO may declare a local state of emergency 
for the City of Flint. Also, Sections 1-801 and 3-306 of the Flint City Charter describe procedures 
regarding emergency luies and ordinances. Upon a declaration, PA 390 also authorizes the CEO to 
issue directives, such as restrictions to travel on local roads. The local declaration activates this 
emergency plan as well as the emergency operations center to conduct activities to ensure the safety of 
people, property, and the environment. 

Since the City of Flint has been a recipient of federal preparedness assistance, a resolution has been 
adopted by the local government for establishing the National Incident Management System as the 
standard for incident management for all-hazards. Through the adoption, the City continues to 
implement the concepts of the NIMS through training, planning, and exercising activities. 

III. Response Resources 

The City of Flint maintains fulltime departments of both Police and Fire. They are responsible for 
providing public safety and welfare to the community. Each department is comprised of qualified 
emergency personnel, and maintains equipment capable of responding to emergencies. A list of 
resources that the departments use for emergency situations can be requested through the municipal 
emergency management liaison. Under certain circumstances, if the incident requires additional 
resources beyond the capability of the City of Flint, the CEO may enact mutual aid. This is a familiar 
practice within both departments. 


2 



IV. Emegency Management Organization 


The City of Flint emergency management organization consists of a number of departments 
responsible for conducting activities in response to emergencies within the community. These 
departments have been assigned to specific emergency functions for which the municipality has 
identified necessary in order to provide an effective response to secure the safety of people, property, 
and the environment. Each agency is responsible for implementing pre-disaster activities to help 
prevent and/or prepare for various hazards that the community is vulnerable to such as: chronic 
diseases, flooding, hazardous material spills, inclement weather, tornadoes, and public disturbance to 
name a few; a more profound list can be found in the County's Hazard Mitigation Plan/Analysis. 
Prevention and preparedness activities include: awareness training, exercising, hygienic practices to 
prevent spreading of infectious diseases, stockpiling equipment, and educating people on how to care 
for themselves during an emergency. 

The CEO serves as the incident manager for municipal coordination. At his/her side includes the 
Finance Director and the Emergency Management Liaison (EML). The EML’s duties include 
planning, operations, and logistics. 

The table lists the functions, assigned agencies, primary point of contact of municipal EOC

Subject: Flint News Article and Update 

Note the below article on the Flint water issue. They are starting to follow the emergency management 
process to include implementing their Support Emergency Operations Plan (Flint's is attached). The 
County has an Emergency Operations Plan that Flint is to support. Opening an EOC is key for 
coordination and that has been done at the city level (at least to some degree but probably not at the 
staffing level it needs to be at this time). 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to 
consult with the county's emergency management coordinator - Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and 
Michigan State Police once he has been given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that 
the situation is beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the county board chair, may then 
declare a state of emergency and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor’s 
declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

We are working to make sure we have all the information needed to ensure the Mayor and County 
Commissioner understand the limitations of the Emergency Management Act and Stafford Act. They 
may find that the energy they are spending hoping for a federal emergency declaration may be better 
spent looking to HUD or EPA for assistance. A better job is needed to manage expectations which I will 
work with others on that. We will also make sure they understand what information we would need 
before we look at a Governor or Presidential declaration. They cannot just ask for a Governor's 
declaration ... they need to provide us information as to why they need it and what they (Flint and the 
County) have done thus far. 

As outlined in the Michigan Emergency Management Plan, Local EM programs must ensure that local 
disaster relief forces are utilized to the maximum extent possible, including the use of local contractors, 
activation of mutual aid and other standing agreements, and use of nearby resources. State disaster 
assistance is used to supplement local efforts and resources, and to help relieve extraordinary burden. It 
is NOT to be used for simple budgetary relief or to relieve hardship. FEMA's first questions will be, "What 
is it (specifically) they need that they cannot get from others." 


Genesee County chairman says he can send Flint disaster request to governor 

Ron Fonger

(This story has been updated with comment from Flint ayor Karen Weaver.) 

FLINT, Ml -- Genesee County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jamie Curtis says he is authorized to 
forward Flint's request for a disaster declaration to the governor and plans to meet with Mayor Karen 
Weaver about it next week. 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to 
consult with the county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Pickell — and Michigan 
State Police once he has been given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that 
the situation is beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the the county board chair, may 
then declare a state of emergency and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's 
declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

Curtis declined to comment further on the matter, but he chairman's letter says he will "do whatever I 
can ... to assist the city of Flint as it continues to struggle with its emergency water situation." 

Weaver said she plans to meet with Curtis and other emergency management officials Monday, Dec. 21, 
to work on the request. 

Earlier this week, Curtis said he did not plan to call a special meeting of the county Board of 
Commissioners to consider the disaster request but would add the issue to the agenda of the county 
board at its next meeting on Jan. 4. 

The mayor has said state and federal funds are needed to respond to health problems caused by lead in 
drinking water here and to replace thousands of lead service lines in the city. 

Weaver's declaration, read to the City Council Monday, Dec. 14, did not include an estimate of damages 
suffered by the city and residents. 

To support the request for disaster relief, the city also announced that it has enacted its "Support 
Emergency Operations Plan" and opened an "Emergency Operations Center." 

Sean Kammer, assistant to the city administrator, said the center is available to answer questions from 
residents and will be used to coordinate relief efforts. 

The EOC is located in Flint Fire Station 1, 310 E. Fifth St., and the center can be reached by calling 810- 
237-6888, extension 5005 from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN 


I. Purpose 

The City of Flint has elected to be incorporated into the Genesee County Emergency Management 
Program. By becoming part of the county emergency management program, the City of Flint and 
Genesee County have certain responsibilities to each other, This Support Emergency Operations Plan 
has been developed to identify the responsibilities between the City of Flint and Genesee County in 
regards to pre-disaster emergency management activities. It also provides for City of Flint government 
agencies to respond to various types of emergencies or disasters that affect the community. This 
support plan is to be used in concurrence with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guideline, as it 
is a supporting document. The support plan will be maintained in accordance with the most current 
standards of the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. Review of this support plan shall be 
accomplished concurrently with the county plan. 

II. Scope 

This plan is a flexible document in which changes from the content of the plan may occur due to 
unique nature of emergencies. Each agency that has a supported role in this plan or its elements has 
developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which provides systematic instructions for 
accomplishing assigned functions. In addition, to support emergency preparedness and response 
efforts, the local government also conducts other activities such as personnel training, participating in 
exercises, encouraging chronic disease prevention techniques; educate the public on awareness 
activities, and use of appropriate land use planning decisions for mitigation and prevention purposes as 
well. Through this plan, the City of Flint continues to implement the National Incident Management 
System, participating in efforts to provide an effective and efficient incident management operation. 

III. Plan Maintenance and Implementation 

The plan has been developed together with local community, and county officials to ensure 
consistency within the county emergency management program documents. The plan is required to be 
approved by the City of Flint’s Chief Executive Official every four years, or whenever the CEO 
changes and is to be forwarded to the County Emergency Management Office. Upon approval, it will 
be implemented, tested through exercises in concurrence with County officials, and review/updated to 
maintain currentness with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. 

This plan has been provided to all municipal agencies, elected officials, the county emergency 
management office and the MSP/EMHSD district coordinator. 

IV. Emergency Management Program Oversight 

The City of Flint has appointed the Chief of Fire to serve as the city’s emergency management liaision 
responsible for working with the County Emergency Management Coordinator in matters pertaining to 
emergency management for the municipality. Pursuant the requirements in P.A. 390, of 1976, as 
amended, Section 19, Genesee County has adopted a resolution that incorporates the City of Flint into 
its emergency management program, necessary for diaster assistance.

CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN 


BASIC INFORMATION 


I. Community Profile 

The City of Flint is situated in the center of Genesee County. At 33.42 square miles, it is the county’s 
largest city. According to the United States Census Bureau, Flint’s estimated population is 99,763. 

Flint has an average number of people identified as individuals with special/functional needs for a 
city of its size. Many of these individuals reside in congregate care centers, but others reside in non- 
group homes where help is provided as needed or on-call. 

According to the Genesee County Hazard Mitigation Plan, the three situations the community is most 
vulnerable to is: inclement weather (e.g. thunderstorms, hail, lightning and severe wind storms, snow, 
tornadoes), structure fires and hazardous material incidents. All of these incidents can happen 
anywhere within the community, but hazardous material incidents are more likely to occur on the 
major expressways and highways. 1-475, 1-69, M-21 & M-54 all pass through Flint while 1-75/US 23 is 
very close to its western border. More information regarding hazard vulnerability can be found in the 
County’s Hazard Mitigation Plan/ Analysis. 

Within the community, there are 19 sites that contain extremely hazardous materials. Pursuant to 
SARA Title III, off-site emergency response plans have been developed by the LEPC to prepare the 
fire department(s) to respond to the specific hazardous materials on the sites. In addition, the owners 
of the site(s) have reported the types of hazardous material that is housed on-site, as required by the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act. 

II. Emergency Management Authority 

Pursuant to P.A. 390 of 1976, as amended, the municipal CEO may declare a local state of emergency 
for the City of Flint. Also, Sections 1-801 and 3-306 of the Flint City Charter describe procedures 
regarding emergency luies and ordinances. Upon a declaration, PA 390 also authorizes the CEO to 
issue directives, such as restrictions to travel on local roads. The local declaration activates this 
emergency plan as well as the emergency operations center to conduct activities to ensure the safety of 
people, property, and the environment. 

Since the City of Flint has been a recipient of federal preparedness assistance, a resolution has been 
adopted by the local government for establishing the National Incident Management System as the 
standard for incident management for all-hazards. Through the adoption, the City continues to 
implement the concepts of the NIMS through training, planning, and exercising activities. 

III. Response Resources 

The City of Flint maintains fulltime departments of both Police and Fire. They are responsible for 
providing public safety and welfare to the community. Each department is comprised of qualified 
emergency personnel, and maintains equipment capable of responding to emergencies. A list of 
resources that the departments use for emergency situations can be requested through the municipal 
emergency management liaison. Under certain circumstances, if the incident requires additional 
resources beyond the capability of the City of Flint, the CEO may enact mutual aid. This is a familiar 
practice within both departments. 


2 



IV. Emegency Management Organization 


The City of Flint emergency management organization consists of a number of departments 
responsible for conducting activities in response to emergencies within the community. These 
departments have been assigned to specific emergency functions for which the municipality has 
identified necessary in order to provide an effective response to secure the safety of people, property, 
and the environment. Each agency is responsible for implementing pre-disaster activities to help 
prevent and/or prepare for various hazards that the community is vulnerable to such as: chronic 
diseases, flooding, hazardous material spills, inclement weather, tornadoes, and public disturbance to 
name a few; a more profound list can be found in the County's Hazard Mitigation Plan/Analysis. 
Prevention and preparedness activities include: awareness training, exercising, hygienic practices to 
prevent spreading of infectious diseases, stockpiling equipment, and educating people on how to care 
for themselves during an emergency. 

The CEO serves as the incident manager for municipal coordination. At his/her side includes the 
Finance Director and the Emergency Management Liaison (EML). The EML’s duties include 
planning, operations, and logistics.

Subject: Flint News Article and Update 

Note the below article on the Flint water issue. They are starting to follow the emergency management process to 
include implementing their Support Emergency Operations Plan (Flint's is attached). The County has an Emergency 
Operations Plan that Flint is to support. Opening an EOC is key for coordination and that has been done at the city level 
(at least to some degree but probably not at the staffing level it needs to be at this time). 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to consult with the 
county's emergency management coordinator - Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and Michigan State Police once he has been 
given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that the situation is 
beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the county board chair, may then declare a state of emergency 
and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

We are working to make sure we have all the information needed to ensure the Mayor and County Commissioner 
understand the limitations of the Emergency Management Act and Stafford Act. They may find that the energy they are 
spending hoping for a federal emergency declaration may be better spent looking to FIUD or EPA for assistance. A 
better job is needed to manage expectations which I will work with others on that. We will also make sure they 
understand what information we would need before we look at a Governor or Presidential declaration. They cannot just 
ask for a Governor's declaration ... they need to provide us information as to why they need it and what they (Flint and 
the County) have done thus far. 

As outlined in the Michigan Emergency Management Plan, Local EM programs must ensure that local disaster relief 
forces are utilized to the maximum extent possible, including the use of local contractors, activation of mutual aid and 
other standing agreements, and use of nearby resources. State disaster assistance is used to supplement local efforts 
and resources, and to help relieve extraordinary burden. It is NOT to be used for simple budgetary relief or to relieve 
hardship. FEMA's first questions will be, "What is it (specifically) they need that they cannot get from others."

(This story has been updated with comment from Flint ayor Karen Weaver.) 

FLINT, Ml - Genesee County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jamie Curtis says he is authorized to forward Flint's 
request for a disaster declaration to the governor and plans to meet with Mayor Karen Weaver about it next week. 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to consult with the 
county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and Michigan State Police once he has been 
given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that the situation is 
beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the the county board chair, may then declare a state of emergency 
and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

Curtis declined to comment further on the matter, but he chairman's letter says he will "do whatever I can ... to assist 
the city of Flint as it continues to struggle with its emergency water situation." 

Weaver said she plans to meet with Curtis and other emergency management officials Monday, Dec. 21, to work on the 
request. 

Earlier this week, Curtis said he did not plan to call a special meeting of the county Board of Commissioners to consider 
the disaster request but would add the issue to the agenda of the county board at its next meeting on Jan. 4. 

The mayor has said state and federal funds are needed to respond to health problems caused by lead in drinking water 
here and to replace thousands of lead service lines in the city. 

Weaver's declaration, read to the City Council Monday, Dec. 14, did not include an estimate of damages suffered by the 
city and residents. 

To support the request for disaster relief, the city also announced that it has enacted its "Support Emergency Operations 
Plan" and opened an "Emergency Operations Center." 

Sean Kammer, assistant to the city administrator, said the center is available to answer questions from residents and will 
be used to coordinate relief efforts. 

The EOC is located in Flint Fire Station 1, 310 E. Fifth St., and the center can be reached by calling 810-237-6888, 
extension 5005 from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Subject: Recommendation for Governor's Declaration of an Emergency 

Importance: High 

Paul 

On January 4, 2016, Genesee County requested that a "State of Emergency/Disaster" be issued by Governor Snyder. I 
have reviewed the situation with key EMHSD staff and we conclude that a recommendation for declaration of a State of 
Emergency is warranted based on the following factors: 

• The situation is sufficiently widespread and severe. 

• The situation adversely impacts public health, safety and welfare. The presence of lead in drinking water has 
been documented. The full extent and required remediation remain unknown. 

• The potential fiscal impact to the city of Flint is severe. The current situation poses an extraordinary financial 
burden. 

• The city and county do not possess the technical expertise to fully identify impacts and remediation. 

EMHSD also recommends activation of the SEOC which will include: 

• Attendance by all state agencies; 

• Situation Reports by all state agencies for situational awareness and to develop a common operating picture; 

• Technical briefings by MDEQand MDHHS on the situation. 

Following initial SEOC briefings, state agencies must determine (in consultation with the state director of EMHS) if they 
need to play a role in ongoing SEOC operations to contribute to addressing the Flint water issue. At minimum, the 
following agencies should maintain a presence in the SEOC during the operational period: MDEQ, MDHHS, Ml 
Department of Education, DTMB, Department of Talent and Economic Development, and MDARD. The SEOC 
operational period is to be determined but will at minimum be 8-5 Monday through Friday. 

The initial focus of the SEOC will be to: 

• Identify and implement any needed protective actions to protect public health and safety; 

• Develop situational awareness and common operating picture; 

• Develop understanding of technical aspects; 

• Coordinate damage assessment; 

• Review resource requests; 

• Coordinate public information; and 

• Identify programs to assist in remediating damage. 


l 


Finally, EMHSD staff recommends: 

• Activation of a Joint Information Center located in Flint which must include PIOs from Genesee County, the city 
of Flint, and other appropriate local agencies to participate. 

ACTION ITEM: The Governor's Declaration of an Emergency is being drafted and will be initiated pending the 
Governor's approval of this recommendation and above actions.

We have looked at this a few times so please double check it. A few notes: 

• I removed the reference we had to a public health emergency as DHHS advised me there really 
is no such thing. 

• The Oct. 1 date is what we used in the 7 th paragraph (that is when they declared a "public health 
emergency"). This date was also reference in Flints IAP they wrote. 

• If signed today, we are including todays date in the 28 day timeframe this would be in effect 
which would put the 28 lh day on February 1, 2016.

GOVERNOR’S OFFICE BRIEFING PAPER 
CITY OF FLINT DRINKING WATER 


What contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the city of Flint? 

A number of factors, not one specific cause, likely contributed to the Boil Water 
Advisories (BWAs) in the city of Flint during August and September 2014. While use of 
the Flint River has increased the amount of natural organic matter in the city’s water, the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has performed well above treatment requirements 
for organic carbon removal. In addition, less than 20 percent of the water system was 
included in the advisory area. If treatment had been compromised, detections would 
have been widespread throughout the city, rather than in such a localized area. 

The city’s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment 
and asset management. Most of the city’s over 550 miles of water mains are now over 
75 years old and constructed of cast iron piping. Cast iron pipe is subject to internal 
corrosion, called tuberculation, which causes buildup on the pipe interior, leading to 
water quality issues, reduced flow and pressures, and leakage. Tuberculation also 
encourages the development of biofilms, layers of bacteria that attach to the interior 
pipe wall. Biofilm growth is common in areas of piping with little or no disinfectant 
residual, and together with tuberculation can clog water lines to the point of insufficient 
water pressure. 

The city has also experienced decades of a declining user base and water use 
associated with vacant homes, commercial businesses, and industrial property. 

Declining water use leads to excess residence time within the city’s distribution pipes 
and water storage facilities, accelerating tuberculation, biofilm growth, and disinfectant 
residual degradation. While the city has recently seen an infusion of funding for blight 
removal, contractors completing this work have been improperly using fire hydrants, 
causing hydraulic disturbances that dislodged and suspended settled debris, which may 
have contributed to the bacterial contamination. 

The winter of 2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water system. The 
city, which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 30 percent, has seen even 
greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold weather-related water 
main breaks and leaks. The city lacks a formal maintenance program for its over 7,250 
valves, which would normally be used to limit impacts during break repairs. Two valves 
on the transmission line used to supply the area of the BWAs were found to be closed 
during the city’s investigation, causing longer residence time, reduced disinfectant 
residual, reduced flow, and reduced pressure. One of these valves has remained 
broken.

The BWAs also occurred during the warmest and, for 2014, relatively wet periods of 
August and September. Warm weather conditions are not only more conducive to 
bacterial growth but also degrade the water’s disinfectant residual carried out from the 
WTP more quickly. Longer residence times, biofilms, and tuberculation also contribute 
to disinfectant residual degradation. Warm wet weather conditions also allow water 
contaminated with bacteria to pool around piping with leaks and breaks. 

Process for Issuance and Cancelation of a Boil Water Advisory 

There are a number of conditions that can trigger BWAs. This includes the following: 

- Bacteria Monitoring Detections - Loss of System Pressure 

- Bacteria Standards Violations - Water Main Breaks 

- Treatment System Failures - Other Interruptions in Service 

- Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has developed a policy and procedure 
regarding BWAs to help guide staff, provide consistency, and maintain public health. A 
PDF of Policy and Procedure No. ODWMA-399-022 is being forwarded with this briefing 
paper. 

BWAs may be self-initiated by the water system, issued collaboratively in consultation 
with the DEQ, or when necessary mandated by the DEQ. Requesting customers to boil 
the water when bacterial contamination has occurred provides an added barrier of 
public health protection. 

The BWAs that recently occurred in the city of Flint were associated with bacteria 
monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards. These advisories were 
issued by the city of Flint collaboratively in consultation with the DEQ. 

Current regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water distribution 
systems were developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have been in 
effect since 1990, and were incorporated into the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended. There are a variety of bacteria, parasites, and viruses that 
can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them in drinking water. Testing 
water for each of these potential pathogens would be difficult and expensive. Instead, 
water systems test for total coliform and E.coli. Total coliform bacteria react to water 
treatment in a manner similar to many pathogens. Therefore, the presence of total 
coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or other 
contaminants to enter the system. The absence of total conforms in the distribution 
system minimizes the likelihood that pathogens are present. E.coli is itself a pathogen, 
and its detection would be direct evidence of a health risk. 

Once a BWA has been issued, time is needed to investigate potential causes and 
implement corrective measures. The larger the water system, the more time this may 
take. Once corrective measures have been taken, samples must be collected and 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 3 


analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present. Using the most common 
analytical method, samples must be incubated for a period of 24 hours before results 
can be obtained. In situations where the bacterial contamination has been confirmed, 
two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 hours apart are normally 
obtained before canceling a BWA. Adding each of these steps together, a normal 
response period to cancel a BWA under these circumstances would be expected to take 
at least 3 to 4 days. 

Recent History of the City of Flint Water System 

Historically, the city of Flint had been a customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) while simultaneously maintaining the Flint WTP to provide 
emergency backup service using the Flint River. The WTP performed quarterly test 
operations to maintain readiness and was utilized twice in 2009, supplying water once 
for 2 days and the other for 3 days. 

In April 2013 the city of Flint notified the DWSD that it would be terminating service in 
the future and contracting for raw water service from the Karegnondi Water Authority 
(KWA). Work on the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron broke ground in June 2013 and is 
expected to be completed with connection in late 2016. 

In August 2013 Rowe Professional Services Company completed an engineering 
proposal for improvements to the Flint WTP that would allow continuous operation of 
the WTP utilizing the Flint River in lieu of continuing service from the DWSD until 
completion of the KWA pipeline. In March 2014 the city of Flint entered into a Consent 
Agreement with the DEQ regarding the Flint WTP’s lime sludge facility. In April 2014 
the DEQ issued a construction permit for improvements to the Flint WTP. On April 25, 
2014, the city of Flint began continuous operation of the WTP, using water from the Flint 
River and discontinued the purchase of water from the DWSD. 

A BWA was issued for August 1 5-20, 201 4, for a portion of the city of Flint due to 
localized detections of total coliform and E.coli bacteria. Another BWA was issued for 
September 5-9, 2014, due to localized detections of total coliform bacteria in the same 
and adjacent portions of the city of Flint. The advisory covered an area of 
approximately six square miles. The city of Flint has a total land area of just over 
34 square miles. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper

While many of the BWA contributing factors listed above require long-term solutions, the 
city has taken operational steps to limit the potential for a BWA to reoccur. The city has 
increased flushing of water mains to limit residence time, maintain disinfectant residual, 
and help remove buildup and deposits within the piping. The city is boosting chlorine 
disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed. The city 
continues to investigate water leaks and water main breaks and the status and condition 
of system valves.

A Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Policy and Procedure cannot establish regulatory 
requirements for parties outside of the DEQ. This document provides direction to DEQ staff 
regarding the implementation of rules and laws administered by the DEQ. It is merely 
explanatory; does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public; 
and does not have the force and effect of law. 


INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, OR ISSUE: 

Community water systems are expected to provide customers with a continuous supply of water 
that meets both federal and state drinking water standards. However, there may be 
circumstances when the public must be notified that the water may not be safe. In these 
circumstances, a boil water advisory may be issued to prevent illness from known or suspected 
microbiological contamination. This policy is to provide guidance to Office of Drinking Water 
and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) drinking water program staff on advising community water 
system personnel when to issue and rescind a boil water advisory, the appropriate content, and 
the manner and method of delivery. 

AUTHORITY: 

Administrative rule R 325.10401a promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 

1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399), being Michigan Compiled Law 325.1001 et seq., requires 
public notification for violations of maximum contaminant levels and treatment techniques plus 
other situations as determined by the DEQ. Each public notice is required to state what actions 
consumers should take during a violation, which may include a statement recommending water 
customers boil all water used for consumption until further notice. 

In addition, R 325.1 1207 allows the DEQ to require the supplier of water to provide notice to 
customers or users that include any precautionary measures deemed necessary when an 
interruption in water service occurs, which could include low, zero, or negative pressure events. 

Furthermore, R 325. 1 2303 requires a supplier of water to include in their contingency planning a 
description of precautions or measures to be taken to protect the health of those customers or 
users that may be affected by an emergency. R 325.12304 also requires a supplier of water to 
notify the DEQ when an emergency is discovered and how the supply will notify its customers or 
users. While the content of this notification to customers or users may vary depending upon 
individual circumstances, each notification to customers or users must state what actions or 
precautions they should take, which may include a statement to boil ail water used for 
consumption until further notice.

STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT: 

DEQ staff met with Municipal Utilities Directors to seek input on issues that were subsequently 
addressed in this policy and procedure. 

DEFINITIONS: 

“Boil Water Advisory (BWA)” - A written or verbal advisory issued by the community water 
system or DEQ notifying the users of the water system that the water is or may be contaminated 
and advising them to boil the water prior to using it for drinking or cooking. 

“Community Water Supply (CWS)" - A public water supply (PWS) that provides year-round 
service to not fewer than 15 living units, or that regularly provides year-round service to not 
fewer than 25 residents. Examples include municipalities, such as cities, villages, and 
townships; apartment complexes; manufactured housing communities; condominiums; and 
nursing homes. 

“Complete Loss of Pressure” - Sustained negative pressures or pressure below five psi in any 
portion of a distribution system. It does not include instantaneous low or negative pressure 
occurring from pressure surges caused by pump cycling, valve operation, or other water 
hammer events, 

“Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)” - The maximum permissible level of a contaminant in 
water that is delivered to any user of a PWS. 

"Repeat Sample” - A sample that is collected and analyzed in response to a previous coliform- 
positive sample. 

“Routine Sample” - A water sample that is collected and analyzed to meet the monitoring 
requirements for total coliform, as outlined in the written sampling plan. 

"Tier 1 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 24 hours after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has significant potential to 
have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure. A Tier 1 
Public Notice also requires the supplier to initiate consultation with the DEQ as soon as practical 
but not later than 24 hours after the supplier learns of the violation or situation. Examples of 
these violations or situations include: 

1 . A violation of the Total Coliform MCL when fecal or E.coli are present in the distribution 
system; 

2. A violation of the treatment technique requirement resulting from a single exceedance of 
the maximum allowable turbidity limit; 

3. An occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak; 

4. A failure or significant interruption in key water treatment processes; 

5. A disruption of the water supply or distribution system; and

6. Other violations or situations as determined by the DEQ on a case-by-case basis. A 

violation or situation that requires a Tier 1 Public Notice also requires the supplier to consult 
with the DEQ to determine additional public notice requirements, including the timing, form, 
manner, frequency and content of the notice designed to reach all persons served, and any 
repeat notices or directions. At a minimum, one or more of the following forms of delivery 
must be used: 

a. Appropriate broadcast media: 

b. Posting of the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the area served by the system; 

c. Hand delivery of the notice to persons served by the system; or 

d. Another delivery method approved by the DEQ. 

Within 10 days of completing the Tier 1 Public Notice, the supplier shall submit to the DEQ a 
certification that it fully complied with the public notification requirements, including a 
representative copy of the type of notice distributed to persons served by the system and to the 
media. 

“Tier 2 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 30 days after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has the potential to have 
serious adverse effects on human health. Examples of these violations or situations include: 

1 . All violations of MCL, maximum residual disinfectant level, and treatment technique 
requirements except where the DEQ determines a Tier 1 notice is required. 

2. Violations of monitoring and testing procedure requirements, taking into account potential 
health impacts and persistence of the violation; and 

3. Failure to comply with a variance or exemption. 

For a Tier 2 Public Notice, the DEQ may, on a case-by-case basis, grant extensions in writing 
for up to three months from the date the supplier learns of the violation or situation, for reasons 
such as coordinating with billing cycles or if the violation or situation was quickly resolved and 
no longer poses any risk to the persons served. A Tier 2 Public Notice shall be repeated every 
three months as long as the violation or situation exists. A Tier 2 Public Notice and any repeat 
notices shall be in a form and issued in a manner that is reasonably calculated to reach persons 
served in the required time period. At a minimum, the notice shali be provided: 

1 . By mail or direct delivery to each customer receiving a bill and to other service connections 
to which water is delivered by the supplier, and 

2. By other methods reasonably calculated to reach other persons not receiving a bill, such as 
apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients and prison inmates. Other 
methods may include: 

a. Publication in a local newspaper 

b. Delivery of multiple copies to apartment complexes and manufactured housing 
communities 

c. Posting in public places or on the Internet 

d. Delivery to community organizations

“Treatment Technique (TT)” - Minimum treatment requirement or a necessary methodology or 
technology that is employed by a supplier of water for the control of the chemical, physical, 
biological, or radiological characteristics of a PWS. 

POLICY: 

A 8WA may be issued for a variety of reasons when microbial contamination is known or 
suspected. Total Coliform Rule (TCR) MCL violations, surface water TT violations, low or loss 
of pressure events, and waterborne disease outbreaks are circumstances when a BWA may be 
issued. Each of these situations is discussed in detail below. However, these situations are not 
the only times a BWA can or should be issued, Each incident must be handled on a case-by- 
case basis, using professional judgment to evaluate the circumstances in each situation. 

Finally, there may be situations when water systems experience contamination that is not 
microbial, but chemical due to a chemical spill or backflow due to a cross connection. In these 
cases, a notice to customers could include “Do Not Use” language since boiling the water may 
not remove the contamination. 

Types of Incidents: 

1 . Violation of a Drinking Water Standard 
a. TCR MCL Violations 

An acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of coliform 
organisms in both a routine and a follow-up repeat sample in the same monitoring 
period, and either analysis (routine or repeat) is also positive for fecal or E.coli. Because 
this MCL violation confirms the presence of a more direct connection to contamination, 
these violations warrant issuance of a BWA, unless there are unique circumstances. 

A non-acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of 
coliform bacteria in 2 or more samples in the same monitoring period for a supplier 
collecting less than 40 samples per month, or in more than 5 percent of the samples for 
a supplier collecting 40 or more samples per month, and the criteria for an acute 
violation did not occur, i.e., fecal coliform or E.coli were NOT detected present in either a 
routine or repeat sample. For example, a system that collects 5 samples per week for a 
total of 20 per month may have 1 sample report positive for total coliform or fecal I E.coli 
during the first week, but all repeat samples report negative for coliform. If another 
sample in a subsequent week also reports total or fecal/E.coli positive, but again, all 
repeat samples are coliform-negative, then a non-acute TCR MCL violation has occurred 
because 2 or more samples reported positive for coliform, but no fecai coliform or E.coli 
were detected in both a routine and a repeat sample.

When a non-acute violation occurs, staff should evaluate possible sources of 
contamination. If a source is identified that is considered likely to contribute disease 
causing organisms or result in water of questionable quality still being distributed, a BWA 
should be instituted. Examples of contaminant sources that would elevate the public 
health risk include, but are not limited to: 

• flooding of the wells 

• failure of the treatment system 

• recent construction activity in the distribution system 

• vermin (birds, rodents, etc.) activity in storage tanks 

• system-wide or extensive pressure loss in the distribution system 

Even if the source of contamination is not easily identified, a BWA may be appropriate 
for a non-acute TCR violation if the violation is widespread or ongoing. A BWA shall be 
instituted if monitoring indicates E. coli or fecal coliform contamination unless unusual 
circumstances warrant consideration, such as the absence of any coliform in repeat 
samples, or when staff are assured that the contamination has been eliminated before 
confirmation results are available. 

However, not every TCR MCL violation must result in a BWA, There may be a few 
exceptions when there is a TCR MCL violation but a BWA is not needed. For example, 
a violation may be declared in situations where samples collected on different days from 
widely dispersed locations report coliform present even though repeat samples do not 
show positive results. In this case, the sampling results may constitute a MCL violation, 
but a BWA may not be necessary. 

If a BWA is deemed necessary by the ODWMA, it should be issued as soon as possible 
but no later than 24 hours after the system learns of the violation. Because violation of 
an MCL results in required public notification (PN) per the PN Rule, the water supply 
may issue the PN and BWA simultaneously in one document (highly recommended) and 
must meet all the requirements of a Tier 1 PN and include BWA language. 

After measures have been taken to eliminate the source(s) of contamination, such as 
initiating or increasing chlorine feed rates and system flushing, additional sampling must 
be conducted. Raw water bacteriological sampling is also encouraged to eliminate the 
raw water as the possible source of contamination. For MCL violations, the BWA can be 
rescinded after the analyses of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the 
absence of coliform bacteria. The number of samples in each set should be a minimum 
of five samples, but can be decreased or increased based on system size or the extent 
of the affected area. Systems are encouraged to use routine sample sites if available 
and to use extra care if routine sites are not available.

b. Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) TT Violations 
SWTR TT violations include: 

• exceedance of turbidity standards at filter confluence point 

• failure to meet disinfection contact time requirements (C*T) 

• failure to meet disinfection residual standards 

Upon determination of an SWTR TT violation, ODWMA staff must determine if the 
violation poses a threat to public health. For example, if the turbidity levels at the filter 
confluence point were found to have exceeded 0.3 nephlometric turbidity units (NTUs) in 
95 percent of the samples in a two-month period, an SWTR TT violation has occurred. 
Based upon a review of plant performance and consultation with program managers, 
staff may determine that no significant health risk was posed and no BWA is necessary. 
However, the water supply must still issue a Tier 2 PN within 30 days of the violation. 

On the other hand, a BWA is likely to be necessary for a treatment plant that gets 
overwhelmed by excessive runoff and reports a turbidity level in excess of 1,0 NTU at 
the filter confluence point for a four-hour period. 

If the TT violation is ongoing or prolonged, or the ODWMA determines a significant 
public health risk is posed, ODWMA staff may elevate the PN to Tier 1 status, which 
must be issued within 24 hours and include BWA language. After appropriate measures 
have been taken to reduce or eliminate any health risk, additional monitoring must be 
conducted. Appropriate measures may include increasing coagulant dose, increasing 
chlorine residuals through the treatment plant, backwashing filters more often and 
flushing key system components. In this case, a BWA can be rescinded after analyses 
of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the absence of coliform bacteria. 
The number of samples in each set should be a minimum of five samples, but can be 
decreased or increased based on type and severity of the TT violation. 

Surface water plants utilizing conventional or direct filtration must add a primary 
coagulant under R 325.1 1008. Failure to add a primary coagulant is a violation of 
Act 399, and may also contribute to a TT violation under R 325.1061 1 (Filtration and 
Disinfection) which requires 3-log inactivation of giardia and 4-log inactivation of viruses. 
In these cases, ODWMA staff will have to determine if the violation poses a threat to 
public health and whether other actions are necessary, such as requiring a BWA. 

Factors to consider if a BWA is necessary would include chlorine residual concentrations 
throughout the treatment plant, raw water quality, C*T compliance, plus individual filter 
effluent and combined filter effluent turbidity levels. 

2. Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

Waterborne disease outbreaks can be declared by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Department of Community Health, a local health department, or other public

health institutions. If an outbreak is declared, the ODWMA will work with the declaring 
agency to ensure affected community public water supplies take appropriate measures to 
mitigate public exposure. These measures will include appropriate public notification, 
including instructions to boil water if appropriate. The ODWMA will allow the water supply to 
rescind the notification when the agency declaring the outbreak indicates it is safe to do so 
as the result of additional monitoring. 

3. Interruptions in Service 

a. Negative or Complete Loss of Pressure 

A complete loss of pressure or negative pressure in the distribution system must result in 
a BWA being issued to all water customers in the impacted area. After pressure is 
restored and the system recovers (tanks are filling and enough sources are operating to 
ensure pressures do not drop again), the affected area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples must be taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution 
system remains free of coliform contamination. The number of samples will vary 
depending on the size of the system and the extent of the area impacted. For very small 
systems that experience a power failure that results in a complete loss of pressure 
throughout the distribution system, a minimum of three samples should be collected. If 
applicable, chlorine residual measurements should be taken to ensure that an adequate 
disinfectant residual is present. If possible, chlorine dosages and residuals should be 
increased by 1 to 2 parts per million during this period as a corrective and preventive 
measure. If the first round of sampling does not detect coliform bacteria, the advisory 
may be rescinded. However, if the first round of sampling detects coliform bacteria, 
additional flushing should be conducted in the area where the positive coliform samples 
were collected and a second round of coliform samples collected from the area. The 
BWA should remain in effect until safe coliform sample results are obtained. 

b. Low Pressure Events 

Low pressure events might not result in a BWA. Low pressure is considered a drop in 
pressure below 20 psi but greater than 5 psi. A drop in water pressure in a distribution 
system could allow contamination to enter the water system through backflow by 
backpressure or backsiphonage. The decision to issue a BWA should be made on a 
case-by-case basis and be based upon professional judgment of all available data that 
may indicate the extent of the problem, such as: 

• Geographical extent of the pressure loss 

• Nature of the service area (residential vs. commercial/industriai) 

• Duration of the low pressure condition 

• Disinfection practices of the water system 

• Relative elevation differences in the service area 

• Status of the local cross connection control program

• Age and condition of the underground piping 

• Amount of underground piping located in areas of a high groundwater table 

• Ability and willingness of the operators to rapidly apply chlorine to the system or 
distribute an increased chlorine residual throughout the affected area 

After normal pressure is restored, the impacted area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution system is free 
of any bacteriological contamination. The collection of coliform samples after low 
pressure events is not absolutely required, but may be recommended based on the 
factors above. 

c. Water Main Breaks or Repairs 

A BWA may be issued during water main breaks and after the break has been repaired. 
Whether or not to issue a BWA will depend on the location and severity of the break and, 
more importantly, a decision based on sound engineering judgment that the integrity of 
the water system has been maintained. If at all possible, repairs should be performed 
under reduced or low pressure by closing the closest valves on each side of the break 
just enough to reduce the flow so the repairs can be made under pressure while the 
water flowing from the break is diverted away from the excavation to maintain clean 
sanitary conditions. If the water main can be repaired under pressure, and no 
nonpotable water, soil, or other potential contaminants entered the main during the 
break and repair process, then a BWA is not necessary. If the water main that was 
removed from service is flushed, disinfected, and sampled in accordance with AWWA 
Standard C651 before being placed back into service, a BWA does not need to be 
issued. 

If a water main break results in a complete loss of pressure before, during, or after the 
repair is made, a BWA must be issued to al! customers in the affected area. The BWA 
should remain in effect until the area is flushed, chlorine residuals are reestablished (if 
applicable), and sample results do not detect coliform bacteria. 

Content and Delivery of a BWA 


If the ODWMA determines a BWA is necessary, the water supply must issue the advisory as 
soon as practical, but not later than 24 hours after being advised to do so. The supply must 
make a good faith attempt to notify all customers in the affected area. Appropriate methods of 
distribution are situation specific, but may include radio or television broadcasts, hand delivery, 
and/or posting in conspicuous locations throughout the area. Delivery requirements as detailed 
in the PN Rule should be used to determine appropriate delivery methods. 

Although there are content requirements for public notification under the PN Rule, there are no 
requirements specific to boil water language. To ensure all appropriate information is 
transmitted to the customers, a BWA should include the same content elements as required for

public notification under the PN Rule. If a BWA is issued as the result of an MCL violation and 
the water supply issues the BWA in conjunction with the required PN (highly recommended), the 
content MUST meet all PN Rule content, delivery, and reporting requirements. 

The ODWMA boil water language is consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
policy that requires water be brought to a boil and allowed to boil for one minute before use. 

The language also suggests the use of bottled water as an alternative to boiling and describes 
the circumstances under which boiled or bottled water should be used. 

Staff should notify the appropriate local health department and the Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development, Food and Dairy Division, whenever a BWA is issued or rescinded. 
These agencies may receive calls from concerned customers or be involved in oversight of 
facilities impacted by the boil advisory and, therefore, need to be aware of the situation. 

Several BWA templates have been created and are available to ODWMA staff on the DEQ 
Intranet. To ensure consistency and inclusion of ail necessary content, these templates should 
be used as the basis for PNs and/or a BWA. Available templates include, but are not limited to: 

• Advisory for a TCR MCL. 

• Advisory for a low/no pressure event. 

• Notification for cancellation of a BWA. 

PROCEDURES: 

WHO I DOES WHAT 

Public Water Supply Notify DEQ of results in a timely manner as required by law and follow 

through with appropriate actions. 

District Staff Respond to all TCR and TT violations plus complete loss of pressure 

events in a timely manner and determine whether a BWA needs to be 
issued. 

• If needed, assist supply in drafting BWA and determining most 
appropriate method of delivery with approval from the District 
Supervisor. 

• If needed, assist the supply in determining actions to remove 
the possible contamination including steps needed to rescind 

the BWA. 

District Staff Provide on-site technical assistance for acute TCR MCL violations 

and other boil water situations as appropriate. 

District Supervisors Assist District Staff in the all matters pertaining to issuing a BWA.

Subject: Backgrounder on Tuesday Flint water event 

Team, 

Here is background on the planned Tuesday event in Flint regarding the $2 million Distressed Cities grant and other 
issues connected to the water issue. 

There are plans for two press releases on Tuesday. The first will detail the two Flint grants and will be released by the 
governor's communications office. The other release, which would detail the other grants, would follow from Treasury 
with a quote from the governor. 

Mayor Walling has agreed to speak at the event, with Harvey Hollins and Dan Wyant representing the governor's office. 
Sen. Ananich has asked to speak, and it has been suggested that Rep. Neeley would speak and it might be better to add 
him to the program. Others, such as Deputy Director Workman and Emergency Manager Ambrose, would be present 
and available. 

The attached document includes details about the planned event, as well as background on the grants from Treasury 
and on the entire water issue from DEQ as well as Mayor Walling's Facebook post about the governor and links to the 
stories in the media about the issue. 

We have a room reserved and are working with the communications team in Flint to have microphones and other items 
needed for the event. 

Please let me know if there is any information you think should also be included, or anything that should be changed. 
Once everyone has had the opportunity to review, we can forward to the governor. 

Thank you, everyone, for your assistance. I know there are lots of moving pieces and many people involved.

Background 


■ The quality of Flint water has been a high-profile concern in recent weeks, with residents 
complaining about the color, taste and smell of tap water since a switch to Flint River water as a 
temporary source as a pipeline is built to Lake Huron as a water source starting in 2016. 

o Residents have attended meetings with jugs of brownish water. 

o U.S. Kildee has worked with labor and community groups to distribute bottled water. 

■ Mayor Walling has issued a letter (included below) calling for state and federal assistance for the 
city, including forgiveness of some $20 million in debt through the Drinking Water Revolving 
Loan Fund and calling for the governor to come to Flint personally. 

o Walling also submitted a guest column to the Flint Journal with similar requests. 



■ He said the loan forgiveness is needed for the city to upgrade its water 
treatment process. 

o Governor and Mayor Walling had a telephone conversation on Friday, and the mayor 
has pledged to work together on solutions. 

■ Rep. Sheldon Neeley also has sent the governor a letter, saying that his constituents "are on the 
verge of civil unrest." 

■ The Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the water situation, with a 
detailed backgrounder and talking points attached below. 

■ The Treasury Department is announcing Tuesday that Flint is among the cities receiving a 
combined $8 million the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships grant program. 

o The announcement of the other grants will follow the Flint announcement. 

■ The Flint grants are $1.1 million to allow the city to replace the functions of the 
old incinerator with new water pollution control facility allowing for the disposal 
of waste to landfills. 

■ The other is $900,000 to allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak 
detection survey, which will lead to prioritizing repairs. 

o A breakdown of the grants is included below. 

Treasury breakdown of Flint grants 

Flint Incinerator: The grant project entails shutting down the current Water Pollution Control Facility 
Incinerator (due to the incinerator not being up to new EPA standards). In order to meet EPA standards, 
it would cost roughly $8.8M in upgrades to the current incinerator. The grant funding will allow them to 
replace the functions of the old incinerator by constructing new facilities which will allow for the 
disposal of waste to landfills. 

Budget Breakdown 

Construction Contractor $1,050,000 

Project Management $50,000 

Total $1,100,000 

Flint Leak Detection: The grant project will allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection 
survey of the city water lines. The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak 
severity. This data will allow the city to prioritize leak repair. The project also covers the expense of 
conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition assessment on a portion of the city's pipes. The 
assessment will guide the city's water main replacement program. 


Budget Breakdown 

Project Planning $90,000 

Mobilization of Crew to Site $27,000 

Leak Detection < 16" diameter $378,000 

Leak Detection 16" diameter or > $270,000 

Pipe Condition Assessments $135,000 

Total $900,000 


DEQ backgrounder on Flint water 


Following the formal approval of Flint into the KWA in 2012, DWSD sent Flint a letter saying their 
contract was thereby terminated (by early 2013). 

Genesee County has been using DWSD water without a contract since May 2014. But Flint took the 
letter to imply a water cutoff, and promptly turned to DEQ with a proposal to use the Flint River (their 
historic backup system). 

This proposed shift was pitched primarily as a money saver. But it put the city in the business of water 
production, where they historically had been in the business of water transmission. DEQ approved the 
use of the river as a source, based on the treatment plant's past performance as a standby facility and 
the improvements we outlined prior to a switchover. 

Several municipalities around the state use surface water supplies (rivers): Blissfield near Monroe, 
Manistique, and Alma to name a few. 

The city completed the upgrades at the water plant the facility and DEQ approved it April 2014. 

There were some initial hiccups. Last summer, there were a couple of 'boil water' notices issued. One 
for a water test that showed e. coli, one for a break in the water main. 

The challenge to using the Flint River as a source is that the condition of the water is variable and 
changes with season and weather. It has substantially more organic matter than deep lake sources like 
Lake Huron. This organic matter is mobilized by high water events, and warm weather also can account 
for more organic material in the water. 

The treatment of the organic matter is done with chlorine. One might conclude that the continual 
answer is just to use more chlorine to achieve water safety. However, at some point on the continuum, 
the chlorine and organic matter create TTHM - total trihalomethanes - as a byproduct. When the 
standard for those is exceeded over several consecutive quarters of testing, the supply is required by 
law to issue public notice and submit an approved plan for addressing the situation. 

You'll note that this regulatory approach means TTHM testing is done quarterly. That means people who 
use the system are exposed to TTHM for several months before the public notice is required. It's 
because TTHM is a chronic health threat. Over the long term (measured in decades), continued 
exposure can contribute to some known health problems. If this were an immediate health threat, 
customers would receive immediate notification to boil their water or not use it. 

Put in context, the EPA (which established the standard and the rule) estimates the existence of the 
TTHM standard prevents an estimated 280 bladder cancer cases each year ... out of more than 330 
million people who use public water supplies around the country. 

It's not "nothing." State and federal law requires quarterly testing for TTHM and that the public be 
informed of it when the annual average of four quarters' worth of consecutive testing shows TTHM 
levels exceeding 80 parts per billion. Flint's results managed to exceed the annual average in three 
quarters, and they must develop a plan to address it. 

But it's not like an eminent threat to public health. Unlike an e. Coli or even total coliform bacteria 
maximum contaminant level, which require immediate public notification and response and are part of 
daily / hourly testing of public water supplies, TTHMs pose a public health concern with chronic, long- 
term exposure. 

It's clear the nature of the threat was communicated poorly. It's also clear that folks in Flint are 
concerned about other aspects of their water - taste, smell and color being among the top complaints. 



The Safe Drinking Water Act requires public water supplies be tested for more than 90 regulated 
contaminants, including microbial contaminants. The act, and the program here in Michigan, work to 
ensure that water is safe to drink. The act does not regulate aesthetic values of water. Here are some 
factors affecting the aesthetics of water in Flint. 

1. It's the Flint River. The water supplied by DWSD historically came from Lake Huron. It's softer. 
With hard water, you get a different flavor and feel. It's why General Motors suspended use of 
Flint Water - it was rusting their parts. Also, there's the 'organics' factor (discussed previously). 

2. The system is old. Flint has more than 500 miles of water pipes. More than half of those pipe 
miles are more than 75 years old. Much of it is cast iron. Hard water can react with cast iron and 
exacerbates the rusty factor, which creates that brown water that angry residents were holding 
up in jugs for the media cameras last week. Valve failure has also been a key challenge. The 
system has an estimated 7,500+ valves. When they stick open or stick shut, it affects the 
hydraulics of the system and increase areas of stagnation. The city has a backlog of valves that 
need to be addressed. They've done half a dozen or so since November. 

3. Flint is old. Many of the homes served by the system are old. Brown water complaints may also 
be attributable to cast iron pipes in customers' service connection to the city lines. The DEQ has 
been encouraging people with water coloration concerns to contact the city and see whether it 
is the service line or the City's line causing the issue. Again, discoloration is not an indicator of 
water quality or water safety, but we recognize that nobody likes it. 

In summary, the City of Flint has tremendous need to address its water delivery system. We are not 
aware that they have any capital improvement funds for preventative maintenance in place, much less 
line replacement project monies that will require hundreds of millions. 

The City was approved for a Revolving Fund loan in 2008 or 2009. As a Distressed Community, they 
qualified for flexible terms and 2 percent interest rate Revolving Fund Loan. After they were notified 
they were approved for the loan, they declined it. Previous SRF loans from the state to Flint bear an 
outstanding balance of $20.7 million today. 

The DEQ continues working with the city to address the TTHM issue. They can take interim steps - from 
scrubbing the insides of transmission lines to carefully monitoring the hydraulic challenges in their 
system - to address customers' aesthetic concerns. Their TTHM numbers already are showing dramatic 
improvement; the November testing showed only one of seven sample points exceeding the standard. 

The key now is that the standard is an average of three quarters' worth of results. It will be some time 
before they are officially "not in violation." However, depending on weather in 2015, it's not 
unforeseeable that we will be having this conversation again by next Christmas. 

The key to the conversation is that TTHM is not a top health concern. That's key because residents need 
to understand TTHM in context, and it is key because it appears the mayor has seized on the public 
panic (sparked, frankly, by their poor communication of the violation notice) to ask the state for loan 
forgiveness and more money for their infrastructure improvement. 

Another key thing to remember is that once the city connects to the new KWA system in 2016, this issue 
will fade in the rearview. 

Key messages: 

1. The DEQ Drinking Water program works with communities around the state to ensure that 
municipalities provide customers with clean, safe drinking water. 

Municipal water supplies are tested rigorously and regularly for more than 90 regulated 
contaminants, including microbial contaminants that pose an immediate public health concern. 


2 . 



3. Flint's exceedance of the TTHM standard should reassure residents that the testing program is 
effective. 

4. TTHM is not an immediate health threat. It is a chronic concern, one that can be problematic 
over the course of several decades of exposure. The public was notified because the law 
requires the city to make public notification, so that everyone can make informed decisions. This 
is particularly true for people with infants or those with compromised immune systems. 

5. The DEQ is working with the City to address the situation. Recent tests show the TTHM numbers 
dropping rapidly. The department will continue working with the city in the months ahead, and 
residents should feel confident that their water is safe to drink unless the DEQ or City notifies 
them otherwise. 

6. The discoloration and odor issues some Flint residents are experiencing are separate issues from 
the TTHM issue. TTHM is odorless, colorless and measured in parts per billion. 

7. Flint water customers who have questions or concerns about their water should first contact the 
city to get answers and help. They also can contact the Michigan DEQ. 

Mayor Walling's Facebook post 

Friend, 

Access to clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human right. 

That's why I just sent Gov. Snyder my Flint Water Improvement Plan. It focuses on the areas of safety, 
quality, access, investment and education. My letter urges the governor to quickly implement these 
ideas so that Flint's water is 100% safe. 

Please contact Gov. Snyder by calling (517) 335-6397 (or by clicking here) and ask him to take action 
immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. 

My plan offers new ideas and also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs 
at the state and federal levels. Here is my plan: 

Safety & Quality 

• 100% Safety is the standard 

• City of Flint releases testing data to assure safety and expands testing to households with 
support from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 

• Support alternatives for those advised not to drink the water by their doctors through the 
Michigan Health Endowment Fund and community partners to protect the vulnerable like 
seniors and infants 

• Bring on experienced river water treatment operational management in the City of Flint 

• Require water testing data to be released quarterly by law in all Michigan communities 
Access 

• Announce an amnesty program for turn-ons and reduce the turn-on cost in Flint 

• Develop a revised payment plan policy to allow customers to come back on to the Flint system 

• New Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance Fund 
for customers (modeled on Federal and State energy utility programs: Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program; Michigan Energy Assistance Program; State Emergency Relief) 

Investment 

• Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital Improvement Plan 
through Federal and State Investments 

• State approves City of Flint's Distressed Cities Fund applications 

• Federal and State forgiveness of payment to Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund 



• Federal and State financing for future improvements 

• City Water Department implements budgeted FY15 projects including leak detection, valve 
repairs, new pipes and meter replacements 

Education 

• Develop a community partnership to provide household and business customers with 
information on testing and conservation 

• Ongoing partnership with Michigan Department of Fluman Services, United Way, Salvation Army 
and community organizations to provide information on water assistance 

• Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with conservation and efficiency (piloted in 
summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

The struggle with our water has gone on for too long. The state must take action and do its part. Please 
ask Gov. Snyder to take action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. Thank 
you for your ongoing support.

I saw in the press this am that DHHS announced yesterday that 
water filters would start being given out today. This should have 
come internally with more detail. I had press questions last night. 


Overall, we should have a daily report on Flint until our 
recommendations are fully implemented. 


l 


For example: 

1 . What are the water test results from the public schools? 

2. Flow many free test have been requested? How many have 
been done? How many remain and how long have they been 
waiting? What are the results - no lead, lead consistent with 
history, higher levels? 

3. How many filters have been distributed? How many unfulfilled 
requests? 

4. New blood test results? Especially in the two zip codes. 

5. Analysis of tech advisory group 

6. Analysis of the GLWA vs. Flint River vs. KWA.

PRELIMINARY DRAFT 



FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS: 


WHAT DID WE FIND? 

1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the 
last round of community lead and copper testing. 

2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb 
action level. There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary 
(which had two samples exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each 
had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than 
the other samples at 101 PPB. 

3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more 
detailed sampling needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within 
each respective school's plumbing can be identified and addressed. 


WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN? 

1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system 
within each school. 

2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with 
schools to implement these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to 
address this issue. 

3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist 
schools in conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems. 


WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL? 

1) DEQ's protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States. 

2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed 
intervals to identify levels of lead and its likely source. 

3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive 
plan to address issues on a site specific basis. 


HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND? 



1) Schools should continue protective measures that are currently in place until a complete study can be 
conducted at each school. This includes the continued use of bottled water for consumption purposes. 


2) We will be reaching out to schools to schedule a complete evaluation, assessment and sampling, of 
their plumbing systems. 



Drinking Water Regulations for Monitoring of Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers 


There is no federal or Michigan law requiring sampling of drinking water in schools that receive water from 
other public water systems, although schools that have their own water supply are subject to regulation and 
sampling as non-community public water systems. Schools served by a public water system may be included 
as a sampling site (i.e., tap) for a public water system’s lead and copper monitoring program if there are 
insufficient single-family homes that qualify. There are no federal requirements for more extensive testing. 

The 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) required EPA to develop regulations to control 
for lead in drinking water. The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), issued in 1991, is focused on controlling 
corrosion within the distribution system that delivers water to customers. The 1986 SDWA Amendments also 
required that only lead-free materials be used in new plumbing and in plumbing repairs. 

In 1988, the SDWA was further amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), to reduce the 
exposure of lead to children in schools and child care facilities. The LCCA prohibited the sale of any drinking 
water cooler that is not lead-free and required that: 

• the EPA identify each brand and model of drinking water cooler, indicating which are lead free and which 
have a lead-lined tank and distribute the list to states (SDWA Sec. 1463), 

• the Consumer Product Safety Commission order that manufacturers and importers of all drinking water 
coolers identified as having a lead-lined tank repair, replace, or recall and provide a refund for such coolers 
(SDWA Sec. 1462), 

• the EPA publish a guidance document and testing protocol to assist states in determining the source and 
degree of lead contamination in school drinking water (SDWA Sec. 1464), and 

• states establish programs to assist schools and child care facilities to test for and remedy lead contamination 
problems, with public availability of results of such testing (SDWA Sec. 1464(d)). 

As a result of a 1996 court decision, States are not required to establish testing programs. In its decision, the 
Fifth Circuit held that provisions in section 1464(d) were unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution because they directly compelled the state to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program 
and provided no options for the State to decline the program. The decision did not, however, restrict states 
from developing and carrying out their own programs to assist schools. 

In 1989 and subsequent years, EPA released guidance and information to inform states and school systems 
how to test for and reduce the risk of lead exposure in school drinking water. EPA’s guidance provides a 
protocol for testing water in schools and recommends that schools take action at fixtures where the lead 
concentration exceeds 20 ppb. This concentration differs from the 15 ppb action level that public water 
systems are required to follow The 20 ppb action level is based on a smaller sample collection volume of 
250 milliliters (ml) and is designed to pinpoint specific fountains and outlets that require attention. 

In 1990, Michigan did provide schools and licensed child care centers with information to assist in testing and 
remedying potential lead contamination of their drinking water as required by the Lead Contamination Control 
Act of 1988. This information included a sampling protocol and guidance on flushing their system to minimize 
lead exposure. 

In 2004, EPA surveyed states to determine what additional programs may exist to control exposure to lead in 
drinking water at schools and child care centers. Forty-nine states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and 
the Navajo Nation responded. Only 16 respondents indicated they have or will conduct special sampling or 
studies to target lead exposure at schools and child care centers. Michigan has not included any additional 
sampling programs or studies. Flowever, some local agencies have conducted voluntary programs. For 
example, the W.K, Kellogg Foundation funded a program implemented by the Calhoun County Health 
Department that sampled schools in Battle Creek. In Michigan’s response to this EPA survey, we included a 
recommendation for EPA to allow schools to be considered as a primary LCR monitoring site so that more 
information about lead levels in schools would become available. However, no changes in sampling criteria 
have occurred to date. 



In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the EPA, the Department of Education, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Waterworks Association, the Association of 
Metropolitan Water Agencies, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National Association 
of Water Companies and the National Rural Water Association to facilitate actions that reduce children’s 
exposure to lead from drinking water at schools and child care facilities. 

Across the country and in Michigan, most schools and child care facilities receive water from other community 
water systems. However, those schools that have their own source of drinking water are considered non- 
transient non-community water systems and are subject to the LCR. In Michigan, there are 755 such schools 
and child care centers that must monitor for lead to demonstrate compliance. 



Response to Corrosion Control Questions 


- Lime Softening can affect the pH in water 

- The pH of the water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leaching of lead from pipes into 
the water 

- As per the requirements in the Lead/Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for two 
consecutive monitoring periods and the results of the monitoring demonstrated that further action was 
necessary. 

- The DEQ promptly notified the Flint water system of the need for additional measures and the city of 
Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need.

RESOLUTIONS - MAY BE REFERRED FROM S.A. 

130210 Resolution/City Council/Mayor Dayne Walling/Request for Appointment of

Resolution resolving that Mayor Dayne Walling and the Flint City Council request 
and recommend to Gov. Rick Snyder that a receivership transition advisory board 
be appointed for the City of Flint under Public Act 436 no later than July 1 , 201 3. 
[NOTE: On December 1, 2011, Gov. Snyder appointed Michael K. Brown as 
Emergency Manager under Public Act 4 for the City of Flint, due in part to a 
consistent deficit in the general fund, the decline in pooled cash, budget issues and 
unfunded liabilities for post-employment benefits. Due to the suspension and 
subsequent repeal of Public Act 4, Gov. Snyder appointed Edward J. Kurtz as 
Emergency Financial Manager under Public Act 72 for the City of Flint, effective 
August 9, 2012. Both the Emergency Manager and the subsequently appointed 
Emergency Financial Manager were authorized by virtue of their appointment to 
“act for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the office of chief 
administrative officer of the City of Flint.” On March 28, 2013, Public Act 436 will

CITY COUNCIL 


Meeting Minutes - Draft 


March 25, 2013 


City of Flint, due in part to a consistent deficit in the general fund, the decline in 
pooled cash, budget issues and unfunded liabilities for post-employment benefits. 
Due to the suspension and subsequent repeal of Public Act 4, Gov. Snyder 
appointed Edward J. Kurtz as Emergency Financial Manager under Public Act 72 
for the City of Flint, effective August 9, 201 2. Both the Emergency Manager and 
the subsequently appointed Emergency Financial Manager were authorized by 
virtue of their appointment to “act for and in the place and stead of the governing 
body and the office of chief administrative officer of the City of Flint.” On March 28, 
2013, Public Act 436 will become effective and provides that an emergency 
financial manager appointed and serving under state law immediately prior to the 
effective date shall continue to serve as an emergency manager under Public Act 
436. As an alternative to continuation of an emergency manager, and if the financial 
emergency has been rectified, Public Act 436 authorizes the governor to appoint a 
receivership transition advisory board, which serves at the pleasure of the governor 
and monitors the affairs of the local government until the receivership is 
terminated.] [Six-page resolution amended for changes proposed by City Council,

RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY FROM 
KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

It is in the long term best interests of the City of Flint to enter into a contract with the 
KWA to purchase up to eighteen (1 8) units of capacity. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase up to eighteen ( 18 ) units of capacity. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, vvitli approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at tire Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25 

[http://w%vTv.mlive,com/ne\vs/flint/index,ssf/20i3/o3/flint_citj r _council_again_delay.litml] , may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it 
to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and wilt be treated in Flint, 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint 
River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River 
Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Fiint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing w'ater 
from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a count}' water and waste advisory board. The 
KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasuiy officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined 
the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years 

[http://www.nilive.coin/news/fllnt/index, ssf/20i3/o3/flint_city_council_delays_deci.html] by getting water from the 
KWA. 

"It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because 
there will be increased treatment cost for the river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water 
plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times 
per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still ... Page 2 of 2 


“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials 
said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

What: Jeff Wright Statement on Flint City Council Approving Resolution to Join KWA. 
When: March 26, 2013 


Additional Info: Jeff Wright, CEO of the KWA, today praised the Flint City Council for voting to approve 
a resolution to officially have the City of Flint join the KWA and its' water line, 

"I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint's City Council and Mayor," said 
Wright. "I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the 
residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials." The next step in the 
process will come with the KWA Board executing the contract for the City. 

"The most important aspect from the vote is the fact that we as an Authority can move forward 
knowing Flint's intentions," said Wright. 

Despite Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz publicly supporting the project, Wright had made a vote by 
council a condition of Flint joining the KWA so the residents would have their say. 

"There is a basic tenet that government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the council 
vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, 
should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside of their community," said Wright. 

At the next Water and Waste Advisory Board meeting a vote will be taken to award a contract for 
construction of the intake portion of the water line. All bids were submitted to the board at their last 
meeting for review.

ANDY DILLON 
STATE TREASURER 


Mr. Edward Kurtz April 11,2013 

Emergency Manager 
City of Flint 

1 101 South Saginaw Street 
Flint, MI 48502 

Dear Mr. Kurtz: 

Thank you for your March 29, 2013 letter, which is attached for reference. As the Emergency 
Manager for the City of Flint (“Flint” or “City”), you have asked for my concurrence, pursuant to 
Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, to authorize a contract in 
excess of $50,000.00 not subject to competitive bidding. This request was related to the City 
entering into an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) for provision of raw 
water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 1 5, 2013. As such, this approval 
will be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012, 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA.

FLINT, MI — Flint residents may soon get their water from Lake Huron. 


The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


"This is about compromise," said Councilman Sheldon Neeley. 


Neeley got support from Councilman Joshua Freeman, after the two were previously at odds about the amount the city should withdraw 
from Lake Huron. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone "no" vote. 


"It was a protest vote," Nolden said. "I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner said construction of the pipeline could start in May. 

The city currently pays to get its water from Detroit. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved.

AMENDED RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY 
FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


BY THE MAYOR: 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the

region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit.

PRELIMINARY DRAFT 



FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS: 


WHAT DID WE FIND? 

1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the last round of 
community lead and copper testing. 

2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb action level. 
There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary (which had two samples 
exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The 
sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than the other samples at 101 PPB. 

3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more detailed sampling 
needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within each respective school's plumbing 
can be identified and addressed. 

WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN? 

1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system within each school. 

2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with schools to implement 
these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to address this issue. 

3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist schools in 
conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems. 

WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL? 

1) DEQ's protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States. 

2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed intervals to identify 
levels of lead and its likely source. 

3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive plan to address 
issues on a site specific basis. 


HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND? 

1) Schools should continue protective measures that are currently in place until a complete study can be conducted at 
each school. This includes the continued use of bottled water for consumption purposes. 

2) We will be reaching out to schools to schedule a complete evaluation, assessment and sampling, of their plumbing 
systems. 



Drinking Water Regulations for Monitoring of Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers 


There is no federal or Michigan law requiring sampling of drinking water in schools that receive water from other public 
water systems, although schools that have their own water supply are subject to regulation and sampling as non- 
community public water systems. Schools served by a public water system may be included as a sampling site (i.e., tap) 
for a public water system's lead and copper monitoring program if there are insufficient single-family homes that 
qualify. There are no federal requirements for more extensive testing. 

The 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) required EPA to develop regulations to control for lead in 
drinking water. The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), issued in 1991, is focused on controlling corrosion within the 
distribution system that delivers water to customers. The 1986 SDWA Amendments also required that only lead-free 
materials be used in new plumbing and in plumbing repairs. 

In 1988, the SDWA was further amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), to reduce the exposure of lead 
to children in schools and child care facilities. The LCCA prohibited the sale of any drinking water cooler that is not lead- 
free and required that: 

• the EPA identify each brand and model of drinking water cooler, indicating which are lead free and which have a lead- 
lined tank and distribute the list to states (SDWA Sec. 1463), 

• the Consumer Product Safety Commission order that manufacturers and importers of all drinking water coolers 
identified as having a lead-lined tank repair, replace, or recall and provide a refund for such coolers (SDWA Sec. 1462), 

• the EPA publish a guidance document and testing protocol to assist states in determining the source and degree of 
lead contamination in school drinking water (SDWA Sec. 1464), and 

• states establish programs to assist schools and child care facilities to test for and remedy lead contamination 
problems, with public availability of results of such testing (SDWA Sec. 1464(d)). 

As a result of a 1996 court decision, States are not required to establish testing programs. In its decision, the Fifth Circuit 
held that provisions in section 1464(d) were unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
because they directly compelled the state to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program and provided no options 
for the State to decline the program. The decision did not, however, restrict states from developing and carrying out 
their own programs to assist schools. 

In 1989 and subsequent years, EPA released guidance and information to inform states and school systems how to test 
for and reduce the risk of lead exposure in school drinking water. EPA's guidance provides a protocol for testing water 
in schools and recommends that schools take action at fixtures where the lead concentration exceeds 20 ppb. This 
concentration differs from the 15 ppb action level that public water systems are required to follow. The 20 ppb action 
level is based on a smaller sample collection volume of 250 milliliters (ml) and is designed to pinpoint specific 
fountains and outlets that require attention. 

In 1990, Michigan did provide schools and licensed child care centers with information to assist in testing and remedying 
potential lead contamination of their drinking water as required by the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988. This 
information included a sampling protocol and guidance on flushing their system to minimize lead exposure. 

In 2004, EPA surveyed states to determine what additional programs may exist to control exposure to lead in drinking 
water at schools and child care centers. Forty-nine states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the Navajo Nation 
responded. Only 16 respondents indicated they have or will conduct special sampling or studies to target lead exposure 
at schools and child care centers. Michigan has not included any additional sampling programs or studies. However, 
some local agencies have conducted voluntary programs. For example, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation funded a program 
implemented by the Calhoun County Health Department that sampled schools in Battle Creek. In Michigan's response 
to this EPA survey, we included a recommendation for EPA to allow schools to be considered as a primary LCR 
monitoring site so that more information about lead levels in schools would become available. However, no changes in 
sampling criteria have occurred to date. 



In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the EPA, the Department of Education, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Water Works Association, the Association of Metropolitan Water 
Agencies, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National Association of Water Companies and the 
National Rural Water Association to facilitate actions that reduce children's exposure to lead from drinking water at 
schools and child care facilities. 

Across the country and in Michigan, most schools and child care facilities receive water from other community water 
systems. However, those schools that have their own source of drinking water are considered non-transient non- 
community water systems and are subject to the LCR. In Michigan, there are 755 such schools and child care centers 
that must monitor for lead to demonstrate compliance. 



Response to Corrosion Control Questions 


- Lime Softening can affect the pH in water 

- The pH of the water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leaching of lead from pipes into 
the water 

- As per the requirements in the Lead/Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for two 
consecutive monitoring periods and the results of the monitoring demonstrated that further action was 
necessary. 

- The DEQ promptly notified the Flint water system of the need for additional measures and the city of 
Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need.

Below is a summary of the Flint TAC meeting to obtain the committee's 
endorsement to switch back to Detroit water. 

1. The TAC endorses the switch back to the DWSD 

2. Marc Edwards of VA Tech supports the switchover to DWSD with conclusion 
that Flint River water with corrosion control will still be 4 times more corrosive 
than water from DWSD after 5 weeks of treatment. 

3. Genesee County states two weeks to prepare pipeline for re-use (flush, 
disinfect, sample, etc) 

4. Supplemental corrosion control still needed with DWSD water and ACT 399 
submittal can be made in approx one week. 

5. No pros were brought to the table for staying on the Flint River.

RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY FROM 
KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

It is in the long term best interests of the City of Flint to enter into a contract with the 
KWA to purchase up to eighteen (1 8) units of capacity. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase up to eighteen ( 18 ) units of capacity. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, vvitli approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at tire Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25 

[http://w%vTv.mlive,com/ne\vs/flint/index,ssf/20i3/o3/flint_citj r _council_again_delay.litml] , may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it 
to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and wilt be treated in Flint, 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint 
River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River 
Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Fiint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing w'ater 
from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a count}' water and waste advisory board. The 
KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasuiy officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined 
the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years 

[http://www.nilive.coin/news/fllnt/index, ssf/20i3/o3/flint_city_council_delays_deci.html] by getting water from the 
KWA. 

"It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because 
there will be increased treatment cost for the river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water 
plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times 
per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still ... Page 2 of 2 


“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials 
said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

What: Jeff Wright Statement on Flint City Council Approving Resolution to Join KWA. 
When: March 26, 2013 


Additional Info: Jeff Wright, CEO of the KWA, today praised the Flint City Council for voting to approve 
a resolution to officially have the City of Flint join the KWA and its' water line, 

"I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint's City Council and Mayor," said 
Wright. "I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the 
residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials." The next step in the 
process will come with the KWA Board executing the contract for the City. 

"The most important aspect from the vote is the fact that we as an Authority can move forward 
knowing Flint's intentions," said Wright. 

Despite Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz publicly supporting the project, Wright had made a vote by 
council a condition of Flint joining the KWA so the residents would have their say. 

"There is a basic tenet that government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the council 
vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, 
should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside of their community," said Wright. 

At the next Water and Waste Advisory Board meeting a vote will be taken to award a contract for 
construction of the intake portion of the water line. All bids were submitted to the board at their last 
meeting for review.

STATE TREASURER 


Mr. Edward Kurtz April 11,2013 

Emergency Manager 
City of Flint 

1 101 South Saginaw Street 
Flint, MI 48502 

Dear Mr. Kurtz: 

Thank you for your March 29, 2013 letter, which is attached for reference. As the Emergency 
Manager for the City of Flint (“Flint” or “City”), you have asked for my concurrence, pursuant to 
Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, to authorize a contract in 
excess of $50,000.00 not subject to competitive bidding. This request was related to the City 
entering into an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) for provision of raw 
water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 1 5, 2013. As such, this approval 
will be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012, 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA.

FLINT, MI — Flint residents may soon get their water from Lake Huron. 


The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


"This is about compromise," said Councilman Sheldon Neeley. 


Neeley got support from Councilman Joshua Freeman, after the two were previously at odds about the amount the city should withdraw 
from Lake Huron. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone "no" vote. 


"It was a protest vote," Nolden said. "I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner said construction of the pipeline could start in May. 

The city currently pays to get its water from Detroit. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved.

AMENDED RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY 
FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


BY THE MAYOR: 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to

The City of Flint has decided that it is in its long term best interests to enter into a

the Flint River. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from the Flint River. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, with approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

ACTION NEEDED on Flint water documents 

Flint EBL Data Press Release V9.docx; Comms Plan - Flint EBL Data Summary 12315.docx; 
Flint Blood Lead Level Summary Report Dec. pdf 


Good afternoon Governor, 

Sorry for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHHS is hoping to issue the release this afternoon to avoid issuing news 
on Friday. The DHHS team has answered the questions and made significant revisions to the press release at my request. 
I think this is far more reader friendly and people focused. 

Here are the specific answers to the questions: 

Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to lead sources is reduced. The purpose 
of screening children for lead is to identify those with elevated levels. Removing potential sources of lead exposure and 
ensuring proper nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in blood lead levels in follow-up testing, which is an 
important part of case management. Lead has a half-life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 days; 
and in the non-labile portion of bone, more than 25 years. 

Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter of each year - July 
through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors including increased exposure to lead in dust 
and soil in the summer months. 


DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.rn. with Dr. Weils available to answer questions. 


Thank you for your consideration. 
Dave

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

December 3, 2015 (517)241-2112 

MDHHS releases latest data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care , case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - Preliminary data indicates that 30 of 1,361 adults and children tested in Flint 
since October 1 had elevated blood lead levels, according to a report issued today by the 
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 

This marks the first summary report on lead testing called for in the state’s action plan related to 
health concerns about Flint’s water infrastructure. 

“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, 
MDHHS chief medical executive. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those with 
elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with the Genesee 
County Health Department to reach these families. We will remain diligent in our ongoing 
outreach and education efforts.” 

Information comes from tests administered citywide to 1,361 children and adults since October 
1. Tests showed that 21 of 969 children age 17 or younger and 9 of 392 adults over the age 18 
were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The report covers test results reported to MDHHS since the state action plan was put in place 
Oct. 2. It includes the number of tests and number of elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 
micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary and venous blood tests that have been 
reported to MDHHS since the beginning of October. People who have had multiple tests are 
counted only once. Five micrograms per deciliter is the level that the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention considers elevated and triggers health care professional follow up with families. 

The full report is posted online at www. michi gan, go v/flint water and will be updated as more 
data becomes available. 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter 
of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors 
including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer months. 

In the third quarter of 2010, 8.3 percent of Flint children 6 and under showed elevated blood lead 
levels. The figure gradually decreased to 4. 1 percent in the third quarter of 2013. During the 
same months in 2014, the figure increased to 7.5 percent and decreased to 6.4 percent in the third 
quarter of 2015.

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letters to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
The state is providing funding for GCFCD nurses to work with families when an elevated blood 
lead level has been detected. During these follow-up visits, nurses coordinate with environmental 
health investigators to meet with families in their homes to identify lead exposures, address 
questions and provide water filters. People can be exposed to lead from paint, soil, plumbing and 
other sources. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations, including the MDF1HS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of distribution, visit 

www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 


To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional video on its YouTube channel . For 
updates, visit www. michi gan. gov/flintwater .

Briefing on Flint water blog post 


Colleagues, 

Here is a quick summary of a biog oost that appears on flintwaterstudy.org, based on 159 pages of DHHS 
emails requested by Virginia Tech researcher Marc Edwards under the Freedom of Information Act. 

The headline: "Michigan Health Department Hid Evidence of Health Harm Due to Lead Contaminated Water: 
Allowed False Public Assurances by MDEQ and Stonewalled Outside Researchers" 

Major points: 

■ Lee Ann Walters contacted DHHS nurse Karen Lishinski to discuss her child's high lead level. The 

response: "He is barely lead poisoned. If CDC had not changed their lead poisoning standard from 10 
down to 5, we would not be having this conversation ... I am working with kids in their 40's and 50's. It 
is just a few IQ points. ..it is not the end of the world." 

■ DHHS reached out to DEQ after some red flags about lead levels; Stephen Busch responded with 

inaccurate information. Even so, DHHS proceeded with studies on lead levels and found spiked levels 
for Q3 2014 and 2015 (third quarters - the summer months - often have season spikes). July 2015 
memos indicate they could see something was awry, but the story implies that DHHS sat on the results. 

■ In September 2015, Brad Wurfel said a study was done and he used it to discredit data from Virginia 

Tech showing high lead levels. The blog post says Wurfel misrepresented the DHHS results and that 
DHHS "stood by and said nothing while MDEQ made false claims about what the blood lead data 
showed." 

■ Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards requested water data on 9/2/15. He waited for several weeks for the 

information, and the article talks about how the request caused a flurry of emails at DHHS, particularly 
between Robert Scott and Nancy Peeler (who work in the childhood lead prevention program). The 
story says the emails show the department was acting unethically because they appeared to be 
stonewalling Edwards and later Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. 

DHHS' response: 

"The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has been, and continues to be, committed to full 
disclosure of information regarding the city of Flint and blood lead levels. To suggest otherwise is not 
consistent with how we have responded. 

"When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase appeared 
to be consistent with the routine seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months. It wasn't until the Hurley 
report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by zip code, controlling for 
seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result of this process, we have 
determined that the way we analyze data collected needs to be thoroughly reviewed. Our after action report 
will help determine how we conduct this process in the future. 


l 



"Our department is focused on ensuring that appropriate case management and follow up is occurring in Flint. 
Summary reports outlining blood lead level testing are posted online on a bi-weekly basis, and we are working

Here is a revised statement incorporating Rich’s suggested changes: 


"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've 
read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint 
water. 

""The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and federal 
officials to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing hundreds of documents at all levels of 
government and from the public health science community. 

"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As they 
uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. Their report may take another month or so, but if 
we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this crisis. I want 
Michigan to be the state that is known for the safest water in the nation. 

""When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for error in testing for 
lead and other toxins. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community. That is 
why I have told my directors at MDEQ and DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on 
the Flint water issue to the state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should 
be able to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe 
drinking water and that we're doing proper monitoring and remediation of blood levels and other health 
impacts over the long term. 


l 


"I want the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has 
happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute 
water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going 
to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

"What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure residents there that we will work hard to make 
things right."

Subject: Re: Please provide feedback: Governor's statement on Flint water crisis 


This is the best narrative I have seen that actually describes how we feel about the situation and our 
resolve to make things right. A few thoughts: 

We might think about a "lead in" to your second para in the statement. Something like "The bi-partisan 
task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, State and Federal officials and 
complete an independent fact based analysis. They have reviewed hundreds of documents at all levels 
of government and from the public health science community and continue to do so. 

Para 3 might unintentionally suggest that there are public health stakeholders who are not as serious as 
the governor. This may be an overreach, but may I suggest 


"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for error in testing for 
lead and other toxins. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community. That is 
why I have directed my Directors of MDEQ and DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked 
on the Flint water issue to the state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we 
should be able to affirm that every testing protocol and conclusion validates that Flint citizens will have 
safe drinking water, and that we are doing everything possible to ensure proper monitoring and 
remediation of blood levels and physical or neurological impacts over the long term. And I want the 
Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has happened." 

Nick and Dan might not like the "invite" but I spoken with them both and they of course will support 
whatever the Boss decides. 


Thanks, 

Rich

Many of us have reached the conclusion that our messaging on the Flint water crisis has 
room for improvement. We haven't conveyed to citizens the depth of our concern over 
the situation. I've crafted a statement to be made by the Governor, and would like you 
to review it. 

This statement is meant to manage expectations on the timing of concrete conclusions 
(the task force report may not come out for another month at least) and to signal that 
action may come sooner than that (we plan to reach out to Mayor Weaver, for example, 
and perhaps hold a press conference with her in January announcing some next steps). 

Here is the statement: 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water 
situation and I've read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the 
processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this

investigation. As they uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. The report 
may take another month or so, but if we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to 
take immediate action. 

"The bottom line is we'll take responsibility for our part in Flint's water crisis. I'm 
committed to partnering with all of the stakeholders who are as concerned about public 
health as I am. I vow to make sure that Flint citizens will have safe drinking water. And 
I'm so very sorry that this happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the 
water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor 
Karen Weaver, and we're going to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the

Governor, 

Attached is a letter from the Flint Water Task Force which will be 
formally sent to you tomorrow. The Task Force then plans to 
release this letter publicly on Wednesday morning. 

You will see the letter is harsh against DEQ. 

Rich, Redford, Flarvey, Meegan, and myself all just gathered on a 
conference call to discuss our upcoming actions regarding 
Flint. While we don't think this letter should change any of our 
actions, we agreed we may need to accelerate some of the 
structural changes at DEQ. 

Our suggestions: 

1) Make structural changes at DEQ as early as 
tomorrow: The recommendations in this letter suggest profound 
change at DEQ and openly criticize Director Wyant. If this is the 
path that the Task Force is on, it is best to make changes at DEQ 
sooner rather than later. That likely means accepting Dan's 
resignation. It also means moving up the termination of the 3 
DEQ personal previously planned for Jan 4 to tomorrow. 

2) Still do statement tomorrow from you regarding 
Flint: This statement will be slightly revised by Meegan to 
acknowledge we received feedback from the Task Force and 
reiterate that we created the Task Force with the intent of getting 
honest independent feedback. More importantly, if we are 
making changes at DEQ, they can also be announced in the 
statement. 

If you have a moment, it is probably best that Rich & I discuss 
with you over the phone tomorrow morning. But I wanted to get 
you some of our thinking tonight. 

Let me know if there is a good time to discuss tomorrow. 

Thanks

Flint Water updates 


We need a better update system re Flint Water. 

I saw in the press this am that DHHS announced yesterday that water filters would start being given out today. This 
should have come internally with more detail. I had press questions last night. 

Overall, we should have a daily report on Flint until our recommendations are fully implemented. 

For example: 

1. What are the water test results from the public schools? 

2. Flow many free test have been requested? Flow many have been done? How many remain and how long have they 
been waiting? What are the results - no lead, lead consistent with history, higher levels? 

3. How many filters have been distributed? How many unfulfilled requests? 

4. New blood test results? Especially in the two zip codes. 

5. Analysis of tech advisory group 

6. Analysis of the GLWA vs. Flint River vs. KWA.

Good afternoon Governor, 


Sorry for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHHS is hoping to issue the release this afternoon to 
avoid issuing news on Friday. The DHHS team has answered the questions and made significant revisions 
to the press release at my request. I think this is far more reader friendly and people focused. 


Here are the specific answers to the questions: 


Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to lead sources is 
reduced. The purpose of screening children for lead is to identify those with elevated levels. Removing 
potential sources of lead exposure and ensuring proper nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in 
blood lead levels in follow-up testing, which is an important part of case management. Lead has a half- 
life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 days; and in the non-labile portion of 
bone, more than 25 years. 

Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter of 
each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors including 
increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer months. 

DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr. Wells available to answer questions. 


Thank you for your consideration.

considerable time and effort to our review of the contamination of the Flint Water supply. Our focus has 
been on assessing what happened, why it happened, and what is needed to prevent any recurrence in 
Flint or elsewhere in the state. We have also, as you know, been assessing on-going mitigation efforts. 

Attached is a letter reporting our finding as to who bears the primary responsibility for what happened in 
Flint. We are sending this letter now because it has become clear to us that ascribing responsibility and 
ensuring accountability is both critical and urgent, and simply cannot wait for our final report. 
Establishing responsibility and accountability is the first step in re-establishing the trust between the 
citizens of Flint and their government and the agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. 
The current level of distrust also serves to compromise the effective delivery of protected services 
designed to address ongoing public health issues. 

Thank you for the support you have given us and your demonstrated commitment to respond to our 
findings and recommendations. 

On behalf of the Task Force

Dear Governor Snyder: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 



This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 
this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 

A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 


2 



legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 


We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 
time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 

We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDFIFIS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community. 

Respectfully yours.

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 

Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote public health and 
protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they relate to reducing 
lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is more work that must be done to 
ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and 
Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health Department, local schools, and our partners 
in the non-profit community. 

These partners are making progress, and we know we can always strive to improve practices and communication for 
continual improvement. 

You make a solid suggestion about establishing a person who is independent of any one of the involved state agencies or 
organizations to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am recommending that Harvey Hollins, 
director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the issue and the challenges 
faced by our cities and will be effective in this role. He will be assisted by senior members of our executive team to 


l 


ensure you will have the continued support and cooperation that you need. We also have retained Chris DeWitt, a 
veteran communications specialist, to strengthen community outreach efforts to make sure residents have access to the 
information they need. 

I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more accessible to the 
Flint community. These are critical measures that can be used as we look the challenges and progress in Flint, but also 
can be a part of efforts moving forward in other areas of our state. It's important that people have confidence that we 
are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to improve interaction among city, state and 
federal agencies. We also will continue to work with the medical community to consider how we can work together on 
wraparound needs of children who might experience health problems. 

People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the water coming out of 
their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - at all levels - is working effectively to 
protect them. 

I thank you again for investing your time and expertise to this vitally important effort. 

Regards,

Hi Richard, 

The Governor is proud of the efforts his office has made to increase transparency and accountability, including 
dashboards featuring metrics for each department and creation of a citizen's guide to how state and local 
governments spend money. We're always focusing on continuous quality improvement in this area. 

The Governor also has promised complete cooperation with the independent Flint Water Task Force that is reviewing 
all state, local and federal actions related to the situation as the administration focuses on the health and welfare of 
people in Flint and across the state.

Hi Dave, 


This threw me for a loop for a couple moments. There is an excellent television reporter based in Grand Rapids - 
Michigan - who I work with frequently and I couldn't figure out why he was asking about this issue and when in the last 
week did he switch to Reuters. Now i get it, 

Here's our statement, which you can attribute to me. 

"We will cooperate fully with any requests from the U.S, Attorney's Office as it looks into Flint's water challenges. Gov, 
Snyder has appointed an independent panel that is reviewing aii state, local and federal actions related to the situation.

Hi, 

I am a reporter from Reuters. Has the governor's office talked with the U.S. Attorney in Detroit or the U.S. EPA about the 
Flint water crisis? 

Have you been notified formally of a federal criminal or civil probe about the drinking water supply in Flint? 

Does the governor have a comment on the acknowledgement by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit that they are 
looking into the contamination? 

Any help much appreciated.

Flint Water 


Snyder weighs declaring water emergency in Flint 

The Detroit News , January 4, 2016 

Gov. Rick Snyder is considering whether to declare an emergency for Flint’s contaminated water a 
week after apologizing to residents for the state’s handling of Flint’s water crisis. 

But Michigan faces hurdles to getting federal relief, including forgiveness for state loans to Flint 
involving drinking-water infrastructure improvements that are covered by federal rules. 

Even before any official declaration can be made, Snyder’s office said Monday that state officials “are 
recognizing this as an emergency and are working with city and county leaders to coordinate efforts, 
streamline communication and tap all available resources at the state’s control.” 

Board declares state of emergency in Flint water crisis 

Detroit Free Press , January 4, 2016 

Gov. Rick Snyder is gathering the information needed to formally declare a state of emergency in Flint 
over the water contamination issue, but in the meantime is "already recognizing this as an emergency," 
spokesman Dave Murray said Monday. 

Murray made his comment after the Flint Journal reported the Genesee County Board of 
Commissioners declared a state of emergency Monday in Flint. 

The board's action follows an emergency declaration by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, who said she plans 
to meet this week with Snyder. 

Specifics of the request are being worked out, but plans call for dealing with causes and effects of lead 
contamination. It's also part of the process for requesting federal assistance. 

Emergency declaration for Flint headed to Gov. Snyder's desk 

WJRT-TV 12 in Flint , January 4, 2016 

An emergency declaration is heading to the Governor's desk. 

The Genesee County Board of Commissioners signed off on the order Monday morning to try to secure 
federal money for Flint's fight on lead. 

By declaring a state of emergency, city and county officials hope to secure federal funding to assist with 
the water emergency. The number they're asking for right now is $45 million from Washington. 

Mother concerned, angry over continuing water crisis 

WNEM-TV 5 , January 4, 2016 

Keri Webber, summed up her feelings in as it relates to the city of Flint and its lead contaminated water: 
"We're terrified." 

The mother of two daughters is fearful of what the future might bring. 

"My girls are 15 and 20 and very close to their next birthday. We have no idea what this means long 
term for the reproduction," Webber said. 

The emotions this family feels on a daily basis is over flowing 

It started when experts discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water flowing from the tap at 
houses throughout this city. Webber said the added insult is paying for that water. 

"Not even offended, I am angry. Our water bill last month was $240 for what?" Webber said. 

Webber’s youngest daughter is 15. Victoria has had extreme complications due to lead poisoning, while 
her oldest Stephanie, 20, appears lead free. At least for now. 

As a mother she wonders what will happen to them in a few years after having consumed lead-laced 
water? 

“I know. There aren't words. We have fought for these kids,” Webber said. “We didn't have these kids 
easy, it took us five years, protected them at every turn and handed them poison in a glass."

Flint water customers with overdue water bills, will now get more notice before a 
shutoff 

WJRT-TV 12 in Flint , January 4, 2016 

A Genesee County judge has clarified a ruling made last month regarding water shutoff notices for Flint 
residents. 

Circuit Judge Archie Hayman is NOT blocking the city from issuing them for customers delinquent in 
paying bills since September. 

That's when lower water and sewer rates were put into place after his ruling that deemed a 35-percent 
increase, illegal. 

It's all tied to a class-action lawsuit against the city - involving Flint residents who believe they were 
wrongly over-charged. 

Attorney Val Washington, who is representing them in the case, says the Judge is instead, requiring 
customers be given MORE notice - 90 days - before the city takes action with stopping service. 

Notices began going out again last month. 

Flint water filter use is low 

WJRT-TV 12 in Flint , January 4, 2016 

There's disturbing information that three months after a campaign began to make free water filters 
available to fight lead in Flint, many homes still do not have them. 

The Genesee County Health department estimates 40 percent of homes have not yet installed the 
filters. 

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is the Hurley Medical Center pediatrician who discovered high lead levels in 
Flint children. She says too many parents are not making the effort to install the filters that can block lead in 
drinking water. 

Hanna-Attisha says last month, all 54 families checked through a health program related to lead said 
they didn't have water filters in their homes. 

We checked with adults picking up students at a Flint elementary school to see if they had filters in their 
homes. 

"We're planning on it today because we just recently got it. The majority of people I know don't have 
them hooked up. Maybe they're just lazy," said Sameika Clayton. 

"Well, I kind of just got mine because everyone was getting theirs in a certain order, or I couldn't really 
take off from work to go get it, so I just got mine," said Queda Wright. 

"I got one just to keep the water pure even though we still drink bottled water," said Lemeer Bell. 

You can pick up free water filters and replacement cartridges at two GCCARD offices in Flint and at the 
DHS offices in downtown Flint.

Work continues on new Michigan water pipeline 

Detroit Free Press, January 5, 2016 

OREGON TOWNSHIP, Mich. — About 1 ,200 workers are taking advantage of the relatively mild winter 
to build the final portion of a new pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron to communities including Flint. 

The Flint Journal reports the $285 million Karegnondi Water Authority project is on track. 

Crews are burying the 66-inch-diameter pipeline on a path that starts with an intake at Lake Huron. 
Sections under construction include parts of Sanilac and Lapeer counties. A $71 million water treatment 
plant is being built in Oregon Township. 

Flint switched from Detroit’s water system in 2014 to Flint River water in a cost-cutting move ahead of 
the Karegnondi project’s completion. Residents complained about the taste, smell and appearance, and 
children were found to have elevated blood-lead levels. Flint returned to Detroit’s system in October.

Kaffer: State apology, resignation over Flint water first step 

Detroit Free Press . January 5, 2016 

In the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day, Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality chief Dan Wyant resigned , followed quickly by department spokesman Brad Wurfel. 

And Gov. Rick Snyder — finally — apologized for what happened in Flint. 

For 18 months, Flint residents were exposed to lead-contaminated drinking water, after the city — while 
under state oversight and with MDEQ approval — began to draw its drinking water from the Flint River. 
Since the switch, an increasing percentage of Flint kids have elevated blood-lead levels. Lead poisoning 
causes irreversible behavioral and developmental difficulties. 

So this apology, and these resignations, represent a sea change. But it's not enough. 

For months, Snyder and his MDEQ attempted to dodge the reality that state policy wrought in the City 
of Flint. As reports, based not only on data compiled or gathered by outside researchers and journalists but 
on the state's own information, began to explain what was happening, Snyder's spokespeople and MDEQ 
officials worked to deflect, discredit and deny. 

State employees who intentionally distort data could face jail time under a 
proposed law 

Michigan Radio , January 5, 2016 

A state lawmaker wants to make it a felony for state employees to manipulate data in official reports. 

State Representative Phil Phelps, D-Flushing, says there’s no law on the books to punish state 
employees who intentionally distort data to change the outcome of an official report. 

Critics claim that’s what happened with state reports that downplayed problems with Flint’s drinking 
water after the 2014 switch to the city’s namesake river. If that’s what happened, Phelps says that should be 
against the law. 

“If that was proven to be manipulation of data or removing data that changed the outcome, it could be 
subject to a five year felony,” says Phelps. 

Video: New calls for federal probe of Snyder admin in Flint water fiasco 

MSNBC (Rachel Maddow Show) , January 4, 2016 

Bryn Mickle, Flint Journal/MLive editor, talks with Rachel Maddow about why his organization is calling 
for a federal investigation, including subpoena power, of what the Rick Snyder administration knew, and

Data shows even higher lead poisoning in kids in West Michigan than Flint 

Fox 17 in Grand Rapids , January 5, 2016 

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - The recent scandal over lead-poisoning in the water in Flint prompted many 
of our communities to take a closer look at the issue. According to recent data, West Michigan 
neighborhoods are home to even higher levels of lead poisoning in kids than Flint. 

The problem in Flint was so bad it forced the head of Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality 
to quit last week. Yet as this crisis continues, data shows the problem is broader than the Flint area. 

In a recent report , The Center for Michigan, a think tank promoting awareness of public policy issues, 
cited evidence that among five Grand Rapids’ zip codes alone, nearly one in 10 kids tested positive for lead 
poisoning. 

“In Grand Rapids, it’s collectively between those zip codes, it’s 10 percent,” said Paul Haan, executive 
director with the Healthy Homes Coalition of West Michigan . “We’re four times the national level of kids with 
that low to moderate to even high level of lead poison.”

Weather spotters serve as eyes and ears for meteorologists 

Port Huron Times Herald , January 4, 2016 

Stan Arnett has been tracking severe weather for at least three decades. 

The 70-year-old Marysville man is one of about 50 trained weather spotters in St. Clair County. 

Arnett said it was something he started doing through his love of amateur radio. 

"A long time ago I was interested in the magic of communicating around the world or even locally on 
two-way radios," he said. 

Now he uses that hobby to talk to people around the world and help meteorologists determine if severe 
weather warnings need to be issued. 

"Any severe weather ... anything that significantly impacts citizenry," is reported, Arnett said. "It's just 
something I can do." 

Rich Pollman, the warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service White Lake 
office, said about half of the 5,000 spotters in the 17-county region are ham radio operators. 

Levees among possible cause of more frequent flooding 

Associated Press , January 5, 2016 

The Mississippi River floods more often than it used to, and at higher levels. Richard Knaup thinks he 
knows why. 

The veteran emergency management director for southeast Missouri's Cape Girardeau County is 
fighting floods again, just as he did last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. 

"Prior to levee building, the river was a wild thing and it spread out between the river bluffs," Knaup said 
Monday. "Now we've tried to tame it. Mother Nature and Old Man River will fight back." 

Ex-Macomb County PR rep arrested in child porn case 

Detroit Free Press . January 4, 2016 

A former spokesman for Macomb County government, the Detroit International Bridge Co. and Cobo 
Center who is well-known in metro Detroit public relations and media circles has been arrested on child porn 
charges by the Macomb County Sheriffs Office. 

Philip William Frame, 61, of Shelby Township is charged with five counts of possession of child 
sexually abusive material, a four-year felony; one count of using a computer to commit a crime, a seven- 
year crime, and a misdemeanor charge for possessing marijuana, the Sheriffs Office said today. 

He was arrested and then released Saturday from the Macomb County Jail after posting a $10,000 
cash or surety interim bond. He was formally arraigned today, where the same bond was continued. His 
next court date is Jan. 19. 

Police ask citizens to report unusual activity 

Soo Evening News , January 5, 2016 

With the country seemingly in a heightened state of alert, Michigan State Police are reminding local 
residents that they can play a critical role with the newly unveiled "If you see something, say something" 
campaign. 

"Homeland security starts with hometown security and our citizens know their neighborhoods, schools

An expert on right-wing terrorism explains the militia movement behind the 
Oregon takeover 

Vox , January 5, 2016

A group of armed activists calling itself Citizens for Constitutional Freedom took over a federal building 
on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, on Saturday, saying they were protesting the 
tyranny of the federal government. 

The militants have called for others throughout the US to come and join their fight. They're tapping into 
a growing trend: the number of unorganized militias in the US has increased 37 percent in the past year, 
according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. 

Daryl Johnson saw this coming. In 2009, as an analyst at the Department of Homeland Security, 
Johnson wrote a report arguing that the economic downturn and the election of the first black president 
could fuel a new wave of anti-government violence from extreme right-wing groups. 

His report was later leaked, provoking widespread outrage from conservatives. Johnson left DHS in 
2010. But his analysis proved correct. The number of anti-government militias grew ninefold between 2008 
and 201 1 , and after a brief period of decline, is now growing again. 

El Nino storms slam drought-parched California 

Associated Press , January 5, 2016 

A strong storm was forecast for Northern California, prompting officials to issue flash flood watches for 
several rural areas hit by last year's wildfires. 

El Nino storms lined up over the Pacific started soaking California with light rain Monday but a series of 
stronger systems are expected to arrive starting Tuesday, forecasters said. 

The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood watch for Northern California communities affected 
by several destructive wildfires last summer and fall. 

Michigan DNR Marks Busy 2015 With Several Successes 

Ammoland , January 5, 2016 

When wildfires raged this season in western states - and a Canadian province - the Michigan DNR 
was quick to put a fireman to work on putting out a hot spot on the Marquette County Road 601 fire. The 
fireman was among several sent to Manitoba this past summer, respond. This year, 54 individuals traveled 
to hot zones in Alaska, California, Idaho, Manitoba, Montana, Oregon and Washington, taking on 16 
different overhead positions from fire-line leadership to command staff and hand crews. There were a total 
of 58 dispatches (or assignments), each one lasting roughly two weeks. 

“Cooperative efforts are key to protecting people, property and resources statewide as well as 
nationally,” said Paul Kollmeyer, DNR resource protection section manager. “We are proud that our 
firefighters have the necessary skills to assist with emergency situations in other states.” 

Kollmeyer said that while DNR firefighters are providing assistance out west or in other locations, 
Michigan remains adequately staffed to handle any fire incident that might start here at home. When 
sending staff on out-of-state firefighting assignments, the state of Michigan is fully reimbursed for all costs 
associated with providing that support. 

Clare County Crews Work To Repair Gas Line 

9 and 10 News , January 5, 2016 

Construction crews in the city of Clare hit a gas line while working near an old car dealership. 

Clare County's emergency manager says the crew hit a line at an old Ford dealership at the south end 
of Clare. 

The Admiral Gas Station next to the old car dealership was quickly evacuated. 

The street was blocked off between McEwan and Clare streets while crews worked to repair the line, 
but has since been reopened. 

We have a crew heading to Clare and will have the latest updates on the gas leak on air and online.

You have heard the news. Even still, watch this video. Just at least the first three minutes. After you start its hard 
to stop. 

Then ask yourself a few questions. 

1 . Did I vote in last year's Election that got Rick Snyder re-elected? 

2. (If No) Do I feel like a complete idiot for not using my valuable vote to keep this guy from destroying the city 
of Flint as well as the rest of our state? 

3. (If Yes) Who did I vote for again? 

4. (If Yes, and you voted Snyder) What makes me so dumb? Is it that my parents raised me to vote biasedly on 
their own views, and I blindly helped elect a scumbag? 

5. (If Yes, and you didn't vote Snyder) How could I have helped keep him from being elected in the first place 
when there are so many biased idiots who's biased political views come from their parents? Why aren't there more 
citizens voting? 

6. How can I get this guy out of office 



Jqn.Gersier 

Let me just say that in this new year, 2016, is a Presidential Election year. This issue of Flint's 
contaminated water supply is a direct result of "you get who you vote for". Gov. Snyder, a republican is where the buck 
stops. He is the one who appointed the special manger to take over Flint's government from the officials those very 
people elected. Shame on the republicans! Remember - you get who you vote for!!! 

Poor Flint!

Snyder weighs declaring water emergency in Flint 

The Detroit News , January 4, 2016 

Gov. Rick Snyder is considering whether to declare an emergency for Flint’s contaminated water a 
week after apologizing to residents for the state’s handling of Flint’s water crisis. 

But Michigan faces hurdles to getting federal relief, including forgiveness for state loans to Flint 
involving drinking-water infrastructure improvements that are covered by federal rules. 

Even before any official declaration can be made, Snyder’s office said Monday that state officials 
“are recognizing this as an emergency and are working with city and county leaders to coordinate efforts, 
streamline communication and tap all available resources at the state’s control.” 

Board declares state of emergency in Flint water crisis

Gov. Rick Snyder is gathering the information needed to formally declare a state of emergency in 
Flint over the water contamination issue, but in the meantime is "already recognizing this as an 
emergency," spokesman Dave Murray said Monday. 

Murray made his comment after t he Flint Journal reported the Genesee County Board of 
Commissioners declared a state of emergency Monday in Flint. 

The board's action follows an emergency declaration by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, who said she 
plans to meet this week with Snyder. 

Specifics of the request are being worked out, but plans call for dealing with causes and effects of 
lead contamination. It's also part of the process for requesting federal assistance. 

Emergency declaration for Flint headed to Gov. Snyder's desk 

WJRT-TV 12 in Flint , January 4, 201 6 

An emergency declaration is heading to the Governor's desk. 

The Genesee County Board of Commissioners signed off on the order Monday morning to try to 
secure federal money for Flint's fight on lead. 

By declaring a state of emergency, city and county officials hope to secure federal funding to assist 
with the water emergency. The number they're asking for right now is $45 million from Washington. 

Mother concerned, angry over continuing water crisis 

WNEM-TV 5, January 4, 201 6 

Keri Webber, summed up her feelings in as it relates to the city of Flint and its lead contaminated 
water: "We're terrified." 

The mother of two daughters is fearful of what the future might bring. 

"My girls are 15 and 20 and very close to their next birthday. We have no idea what this means long 
term for the reproduction," Webber said. 

The emotions this family feels on a daily basis is over flowing 

It started when experts discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water flowing from the tap at 
houses throughout this city. Webber said the added insult is paying for that water. 

"Not even offended, I am angry. Our water bill last month was $240 for what?" Webber said. 

Webber’s youngest daughter is 15. Victoria has had extreme complications due to lead poisoning, 
while her oldest Stephanie, 20, appears lead free. At least for now. 

As a mother she wonders what will happen to them in a few years after having consumed lead-laced 
water? 

“I know. There aren't words. We have fought for these kids,” Webber said. “We didn't have these 
kids easy, it took us five years, protected them at every turn and handed them poison in a glass." 

Flint water customers with overdue water bills, will now get more notice before 
a shutoff 

WJRT-TV 12 in Flint . January 4, 2016 

A Genesee County judge has clarified a ruling made last month regarding water shutoff notices for 
Flint residents. 

Circuit Judge Archie Hayman is NOT blocking the city from issuing them for customers delinquent in 
paying bills since September. 

That's when lower water and sewer rates were put into place after his ruling that deemed a 35- 
percent increase, illegal. 

It's all tied to a class-action lawsuit against the city - involving Flint residents who believe they were 
wrongly over-charged. 

Attorney Val Washington, who is representing them in the case, says the Judge is instead, requiring 
customers be given MORE notice - 90 days - before the city takes action with stopping service. 

Notices began going out again last month.

Flint water filter use is low 

WJRT-TV 12 in Flint , January 4, 2016 

There's disturbing information that three months after a campaign began to make free water filters 
available to fight lead in Flint, many homes still do not have them. 

The Genesee County Health department estimates 40 percent of homes have not yet installed the 
filters. 

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is the Hurley Medical Center pediatrician who discovered high lead levels in 
Flint children. She says too many parents are not making the effort to install the filters that can block lead 
in drinking water. 

Hanna-Attisha says last month, all 54 families checked through a health program related to lead said 
they didn't have water filters in their homes. 

We checked with adults picking up students at a Flint elementary school to see if they had filters in 
their homes. 

"We're planning on it today because we just recently got it. The majority of people I know don't have 
them hooked up. Maybe they're just lazy," said Sameika Clayton. 

"Well, I kind of just got mine because everyone was getting theirs in a certain order, or I couldn't 
really take off from work to go get it, so I just got mine," said Queda Wright. 

"I got one just to keep the water pure even though we still drink bottled water," said Lemeer Bell. 

You can pick up free water filters and replacement cartridges at two GCCARD offices in Flint and at 
the DHS offices in downtown Flint.

Work continues on new Michigan water pipeline 

Detroit Free Press, January 5, 2016 

OREGON TOWNSHIP, Mich. — About 1,200 workers are taking advantage of the relatively mild 
winter to build the final portion of a new pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron to communities including 
Flint. 

The Flint Journal reports the $285 million Karegnondi Water Authority project is on track. 

Crews are burying the 66-inch-diameter pipeline on a path that starts with an intake at Lake Huron. 
Sections under construction include parts of Sanilac and Lapeer counties. A $71 million water treatment 
plant is being built in Oregon Township. 

Flint switched from Detroit’s water system in 2014 to Flint River water in a cost-cutting move ahead 
of the Karegnondi project’s completion. Residents complained about the taste, smell and appearance, 
and children were found to have elevated blood-lead levels. Flint returned to Detroit’s system in October. 

Kaffer: State apology, resignation over Flint water first step 

Detroit Free Press , January 5, 2016 

In the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day, Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality chief Dan Wyant resigned , followed quickly by department spokesman Brad Wurfel. 

And Gov. Rick Snyder — finally — apologized for what happened in Flint. 

For 18 months, Flint residents were exposed to lead-contaminated drinking water, after the city — 
while under state oversight and with MDEQ approval — began to draw its drinking water from the Flint 
River. Since the switch, an increasing percentage of Flint kids have elevated blood-lead levels. Lead 
poisoning causes irreversible behavioral and developmental difficulties. 

So this apology, and these resignations, represent a sea change. But it's not enough. 

For months, Snyder and his MDEQ attempted to dodge the reality that state policy wrought in the 
City of Flint. As reports, based not only on data compiled or gathered by outside 
researchers and journalists but on the state's own information, began to explain what was happening, 
Snyder's spokespeople and MDEQ officials worked to deflect, discredit and deny.

State employees who intentionally distort data could face jail time under a 
proposed law 

Michigan Radio , January 5, 2016 

A state lawmaker wants to make it a felony for state employees to manipulate data in official reports. 

State Representative Phil Phelps, D-Flushing, says there’s no law on the books to punish state 
employees who intentionally distort data to change the outcome of an official report. 

Critics claim that’s what happened with state reports that downplayed problems with Flint's drinking 
water after the 2014 switch to the city’s namesake river. If that’s what happened, Phelps says that should 
be against the law. 

“If that was proven to be manipulation of data or removing data that changed the outcome, it could 
be subject to a five year felony,” says Phelps. 

Video: New calls for federal probe of Snyder admin in Flint water fiasco 

Bryn Mickle, Flint Journal/MLive editor, talks with Rachel Maddow about why his organization is 
calling for a federal investigation, including subpoena power, of what the Rick Snyder administration

Data shows even higher lead poisoning in kids in West Michigan than Flint 

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - The recent scandal over lead-poisoning in the water in Flint prompted 
many of our communities to take a closer look at the issue. According to recent data, West Michigan 
neighborhoods are home to even higher levels of lead poisoning in kids than Flint. 

The problem in Flint was so bad it forced the head of Michigan’s Department of Environmental 
Quality to quit last week. Yet as this crisis continues, data shows the problem is broader than the Flint 
area. 

In a recent report , The Center for Michigan, a think tank promoting awareness of public policy 
issues, cited evidence that among five Grand Rapids’ zip codes alone, nearly one in 10 kids tested 
positive for lead poisoning. 

“In Grand Rapids, it’s collectively between those zip codes, it’s 10 percent,” said Paul Haan, 
executive director with the Healthy Homes Coalition of West Michigan . “We’re four times the national 
level of kids with that low to moderate to even high level of lead poison.” 


Emergency Management and Homeland Security 

Weather spotters serve as eyes and ears for meteorologists 

Port Huron Times Herald . January 4, 2016 

Stan Arnett has been tracking severe weather for at least three decades. 

The 70-year-old Marysville man is one of about 50 trained weather spotters in St. Clair County. 

Arnett said it was something he started doing through his love of amateur radio. 

"A long time ago I was interested in the magic of communicating around the world or even locally on 
two-way radios," he said. 

Now he uses that hobby to talk to people around the world and help meteorologists determine if 
severe weather warnings need to be issued. 

"Any severe weather ... anything that significantly impacts citizenry," is reported, Arnett said. "It’s just 
something I can do."

Rich Pollman, the warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service White Lake 
office, said about half of the 5,000 spotters in the 17-county region are ham radio operators. 

Levees among possible cause of more frequent flooding 

Associated Press , January 5, 2016 

The Mississippi River floods more often than it used to, and at higher levels. Richard Knaup thinks 
he knows why. 

The veteran emergency management director for southeast Missouri's Cape Girardeau County is 
fighting floods again, just as he did last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. 

"Prior to levee building, the river was a wild thing and it spread out between the river bluffs," Knaup 
said Monday. "Now we've tried to tame it. Mother Nature and Old Man River will fight back." 

Ex-Macomb County PR rep arrested in child porn case 

Detroit Free Press . January 4, 2016 

A former spokesman for Macomb County government, the Detroit International Bridge Co. and Cobo 
Center who is well-known in metro Detroit public relations and media circles has been arrested on child 
porn charges by the Macomb County Sheriffs Office. 

Philip William Frame, 61, of Shelby Township is charged with five counts of possession of child 
sexually abusive material, a four-year felony; one count of using a computer to commit a crime, a seven- 
year crime, and a misdemeanor charge for possessing marijuana, the Sheriff's Office said today. 

He was arrested and then released Saturday from the Macomb County Jail after posting a $10,000 
cash or surety interim bond. He was formally arraigned today, where the same bond was continued. His 
next court date is Jan. 1 9. 

Police ask citizens to report unusual activity 

Soo Evening News , January 5, 2016 

With the country seemingly in a heightened state of alert, Michigan State Police are reminding local 
residents that they can play a critical role with the newly unveiled "If you see something, say something" 
campaign. 

"Homeland security starts with hometown security and our citizens know their neighborhoods, 
schools and work places better than anyone," said F/Lt. Joe Shier of the St. Ignace Post. "If something 
appears suspicious or out of place, don't hesitate to report it to law enforcement." 

An expert on right-wing terrorism explains the militia movement behind the 
Oregon takeover 

Vox , January 5, 2016 

A group of armed activists calling itself Citizens for Constitutional Freedom took over a federal 
building on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, on Saturday, saying they were 
protesting the tyranny of the federal government. 

The militants have called for others throughout the US to come and join their fight. They're tapping 
into a growing trend: the number of unorganized militias in the US has increased 37 percent in the past 
year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. 

Daryl Johnson saw this coming. In 2009, as an analyst at the Department of Homeland Security, 
Johnson wrote a report arguing that the economic downturn and the election of the first black president 
could fuel a new wave of anti-government violence from extreme right-wing groups. 

His report was later leaked, provoking widespread outrage from conservatives. Johnson left DHS in 
2010. But his analysis proved correct. The number of anti-government militias grew ninefold between 
2008 and 201 1 , and after a brief period of decline, is now growing again.

Michigan DNR Marks Busy 2015 With Several Successes 

Ammoland , January 5, 2016 

When wildfires raged this season in western states - and a Canadian province - the Michigan DNR 
was quick to put a fireman to work on putting out a hot spot on the Marquette County Road 601 fire. The 
fireman was among several sent to Manitoba this past summer, respond. This year, 54 individuals 
traveled to hot zones in Alaska, California, Idaho, Manitoba, Montana, Oregon and Washington, taking on 
16 different overhead positions from fire-line leadership to command staff and hand crews. There were a 
total of 58 dispatches (or assignments), each one lasting roughly two weeks. 

“Cooperative efforts are key to protecting people, property and resources statewide as well as 
nationally,” said Paul Kollmeyer, DNR resource protection section manager. “We are proud that our 
firefighters have the necessary skills to assist with emergency situations in other states.” 

Kollmeyer said that while DNR firefighters are providing assistance out west or in other locations, 
Michigan remains adequately staffed to handle any fire incident that might start here at home. When 
sending staff on out-of-state firefighting assignments, the state of Michigan is fully reimbursed for all costs 
associated with providing that support.

You have heard the news. Even still, watch this video. Just at least the first three minutes. After you start its 
hard to stop. 

Then ask yourself a few questions. 

1 . Did I vote in last year's Election that got Rick Snyder re-elected? 

2. (If No) Do I feel like a complete idiot for not using my valuable vote to keep this guy from destroying the city 
of Flint as well as the rest of our state? 

3. (If Yes) Who did I vote for again? 

4. (If Yes, and you voted Snyder) What makes me so dumb? Is it that my parents raised me to vote biasedly 
on their own views, and I blindly helped elect a scumbag? 

5. (If Yes, and you didn't vote Snyder) How could I have helped keep him from being elected in the first place 
when there are so many biased idiots who's biased political views come from their parents? Why aren't there more 
citizens voting? 

6. How can I get this guy out of office 



Jon Gerster 


Let me just say that in this new year, 2016, is a Presidential Election year. This issue of Flint's 
contaminated wafer supply is a direct result of "you get who you vote for". Gov. Snyder, a republican is where the 
buck stops. He is the one who appointed the special manger to take over Flint's government from the officials those 
very people elected. Shame on the republicans! Remember - you get who you vote for!!! 
Poor Flint!

There's disturbing information that three months after a campaign began to make free water filters available to 
fight lead in Flint, many homes still do not have them. #FlintWafer

Hi Lindsey, 

In your Michigan Radio documentary on Flint water, you missed an important piece in your timeline, where you wrote "...And 
once Detroit realized Flint was going to leave its system, it jacked Flint's water rates up even more - to the tune of $10 million 
over the two years the new pipeline would be under construction. 

So in the spring of 2013, Detroit kind of had Flint over a barrel. 

It was state treasury officials who got creative. 

Their solution? 

Forget Detroit, Flint's emergency manager said. Let Flint get really cheap water from the Flint River." 

That's not factual information for your readers and listeners. In fact, in the spring of 2013, the Flint City Council, and Mayor 
Walling, made the decision to switch to Karegnondi, and in the meantime, take some of its water from the Flint River. This was 
approved at the city council meeting in a 7-1 vote on Monday, March 25, 2013. Their decision was then sent to the emergency 
manager to approve. In fact, at the time, Flint City Council President Scott Kincaid said "I've never been a fan of staying with 
Detroit.” 

It is critical to note that Flint and Genesee Co. had been in discussions to start their own water authority for years before this 
decision was reached. They had been gathering information on a switch and leaning toward that decision far before the Gov. 
was even in office. 

Here is a link to the city council re s olutions, as well as a comprehensive story from 2013 on that city council's decision. 

http://www,miive.con'i/ new s /fNn t/index. ss f /20 13/03/flsnt city council approves re . htmi 

This needs to be corrected, and quickly. Please let me know if you'd like any additional information or resources to add to the 
timeline of events published yesterday. 

Thank you,

Dear Governor Snyder: 


The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 
This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 



this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 


A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 
legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 

We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 





time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 


We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDHHS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community.

We need a better update system re Flint Water. 


I saw in the press this am that DHHS announced 
yesterday that water filters would start being given 
out today. This should have come internally with 
more detail. I had press questions last night. 


Overall, we should have a daily report on Flint until 
our recommendations are fully implemented. 


For example: 

1 . What are the water test results from the public 
schools? 

2. Flow many free test have been requested? How 
many have been done? How many remain and how 
long have they been waiting? What are the results - 
no lead, lead consistent with history, higher levels? 

3. How many fdters have been distributed? How 
many unfulfilled requests? 

4. New blood test results? Especially in the two zip 
codes. 

5. Analysis of tech advisory group 

6. Analysis of the GLWA vs. Flint River vs. KWA.

PRELIMINARY DRAFT 



FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS: 


WHAT DID WE FIND? 

1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the 
last round of community lead and copper testing. 

2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb 
action level. There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary 
(which had two samples exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each 
had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than 
the other samples at 101 PPB. 

3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more 
detailed sampling needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within 
each respective school's plumbing can be identified and addressed. 


WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN? 

1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system 
within each school. 

2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with 
schools to implement these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to 
address this issue. 

3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist 
schools in conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems. 


WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL? 

1) DEQ's protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States. 

2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed 
intervals to identify levels of lead and its likely source. 

3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive 
plan to address issues on a site specific basis. 


HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND? 



1) Schools should continue protective measures that are currently in place until a complete study can be 
conducted at each school. This includes the continued use of bottled water for consumption purposes. 


2) We will be reaching out to schools to schedule a complete evaluation, assessment and sampling, of 
their plumbing systems. 



Drinking Water Regulations for Monitoring of Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers 


There is no federal or Michigan law requiring sampling of drinking water in schools that receive water from 
other public water systems, although schools that have their own water supply are subject to regulation and 
sampling as non-community public water systems. Schools served by a public water system may be included 
as a sampling site (i.e., tap) for a public water system’s lead and copper monitoring program if there are 
insufficient single-family homes that qualify. There are no federal requirements for more extensive testing. 

The 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) required EPA to develop regulations to control 
for lead in drinking water. The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), issued in 1991, is focused on controlling 
corrosion within the distribution system that delivers water to customers. The 1986 SDWA Amendments also 
required that only lead-free materials be used in new plumbing and in plumbing repairs. 

In 1988, the SDWA was further amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), to reduce the 
exposure of lead to children in schools and child care facilities. The LCCA prohibited the sale of any drinking 
water cooler that is not lead-free and required that: 

• the EPA identify each brand and model of drinking water cooler, indicating which are lead free and which 
have a lead-lined tank and distribute the list to states (SDWA Sec. 1463), 

• the Consumer Product Safety Commission order that manufacturers and importers of all drinking water 
coolers identified as having a lead-lined tank repair, replace, or recall and provide a refund for such coolers 
(SDWA Sec. 1462), 

• the EPA publish a guidance document and testing protocol to assist states in determining the source and 
degree of lead contamination in school drinking water (SDWA Sec. 1464), and 

• states establish programs to assist schools and child care facilities to test for and remedy lead contamination 
problems, with public availability of results of such testing (SDWA Sec. 1464(d)). 

As a result of a 1996 court decision, States are not required to establish testing programs. In its decision, the 
Fifth Circuit held that provisions in section 1464(d) were unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution because they directly compelled the state to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program 
and provided no options for the State to decline the program. The decision did not, however, restrict states 
from developing and carrying out their own programs to assist schools. 

In 1989 and subsequent years, EPA released guidance and information to inform states and school systems 
how to test for and reduce the risk of lead exposure in school drinking water. EPA’s guidance provides a 
protocol for testing water in schools and recommends that schools take action at fixtures where the lead 
concentration exceeds 20 ppb. This concentration differs from the 15 ppb action level that public water 
systems are required to follow The 20 ppb action level is based on a smaller sample collection volume of 
250 milliliters (ml) and is designed to pinpoint specific fountains and outlets that require attention. 

In 1990, Michigan did provide schools and licensed child care centers with information to assist in testing and 
remedying potential lead contamination of their drinking water as required by the Lead Contamination Control 
Act of 1988. This information included a sampling protocol and guidance on flushing their system to minimize 
lead exposure. 

In 2004, EPA surveyed states to determine what additional programs may exist to control exposure to lead in 
drinking water at schools and child care centers. Forty-nine states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and 
the Navajo Nation responded. Only 16 respondents indicated they have or will conduct special sampling or 
studies to target lead exposure at schools and child care centers. Michigan has not included any additional 
sampling programs or studies. Flowever, some local agencies have conducted voluntary programs. For 
example, the W.K, Kellogg Foundation funded a program implemented by the Calhoun County Health 
Department that sampled schools in Battle Creek. In Michigan’s response to this EPA survey, we included a 
recommendation for EPA to allow schools to be considered as a primary LCR monitoring site so that more 
information about lead levels in schools would become available. However, no changes in sampling criteria 
have occurred to date. 



In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the EPA, the Department of Education, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Waterworks Association, the Association of 
Metropolitan Water Agencies, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National Association 
of Water Companies and the National Rural Water Association to facilitate actions that reduce children’s 
exposure to lead from drinking water at schools and child care facilities. 

Across the country and in Michigan, most schools and child care facilities receive water from other community 
water systems. However, those schools that have their own source of drinking water are considered non- 
transient non-community water systems and are subject to the LCR. In Michigan, there are 755 such schools 
and child care centers that must monitor for lead to demonstrate compliance. 



Response to Corrosion Control Questions 


- Lime Softening can affect the pH in water 

- The pH of the water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leaching of lead from pipes into 
the water 

- As per the requirements in the Lead/Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for two 
consecutive monitoring periods and the results of the monitoring demonstrated that further action was 
necessary. 

- The DEQ promptly notified the Flint water system of the need for additional measures and the city of 
Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need.

Below is a summary of the Flint TAC meeting to obtain the committee's endorsement to switch 
back to Detroit water. 

1. The TAC endorses the switch back to the DWSD 

2. Marc Edwards of VA Tech supports the switchover to DWSD with conclusion that Flint River 
water with corrosion control will still be 4 times more corrosive 

than water from DWSD after 5 weeks of treatment. 

3. Genesee County states two weeks to prepare pipeline for re-use (flush, disinfect, sample, etc) 

4. Supplemental corrosion control still needed with DWSD water and ACT 399 submittal can be 
made in approx one week. 

5. No pros were brought to the table for staying on the Flint River.

RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY FROM 
KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

It is in the long term best interests of the City of Flint to enter into a contract with the 
KWA to purchase up to eighteen (1 8) units of capacity. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase up to eighteen ( 18 ) units of capacity. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, vvitli approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at tire Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25 

[http://w%vTv.mlive,com/ne\vs/flint/index,ssf/20i3/o3/flint_citj r _council_again_delay.litml] , may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it 
to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and wilt be treated in Flint, 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint 
River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River 
Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Fiint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing w'ater 
from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a count}' water and waste advisory board. The 
KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasuiy officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined 
the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years 

[http://www.nilive.coin/news/fllnt/index, ssf/20i3/o3/flint_city_council_delays_deci.html] by getting water from the 
KWA. 

"It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because 
there will be increased treatment cost for the river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water 
plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times 
per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote.

“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials 
said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

What: Jeff Wright Statement on Flint City Council Approving Resolution to Join KWA. 
When: March 26, 2013 


Additional Info: Jeff Wright, CEO of the KWA, today praised the Flint City Council for voting to approve 
a resolution to officially have the City of Flint join the KWA and its' water line, 

"I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint's City Council and Mayor," said 
Wright. "I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the 
residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials." The next step in the 
process will come with the KWA Board executing the contract for the City. 

"The most important aspect from the vote is the fact that we as an Authority can move forward 
knowing Flint's intentions," said Wright. 

Despite Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz publicly supporting the project, Wright had made a vote by 
council a condition of Flint joining the KWA so the residents would have their say. 

"There is a basic tenet that government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the council 
vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, 
should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside of their community," said Wright. 

At the next Water and Waste Advisory Board meeting a vote will be taken to award a contract for 
construction of the intake portion of the water line. All bids were submitted to the board at their last 
meeting for review.

STATE TREASURER 


Mr. Edward Kurtz April 11,2013 

Emergency Manager 
City of Flint 

1 101 South Saginaw Street 
Flint, MI 48502 

Dear Mr. Kurtz: 

Thank you for your March 29, 2013 letter, which is attached for reference. As the Emergency 
Manager for the City of Flint (“Flint” or “City”), you have asked for my concurrence, pursuant to 
Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, to authorize a contract in 
excess of $50,000.00 not subject to competitive bidding. This request was related to the City 
entering into an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) for provision of raw 
water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 1 5, 2013. As such, this approval 
will be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012, 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA.

FLINT, MI — Flint residents may soon get their water from Lake Huron. 


The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


"This is about compromise," said Councilman Sheldon Neeley. 


Neeley got support from Councilman Joshua Freeman, after the two were previously at odds about the amount the city should withdraw 
from Lake Huron. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone "no" vote. 


"It was a protest vote," Nolden said. "I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner said construction of the pipeline could start in May. 

The city currently pays to get its water from Detroit. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved.

AMENDED RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY 
FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


BY THE MAYOR:

determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

The City of Flint has decided that it is in its long term best interests to enter into a 
contract with the KWA to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from 
the Flint River. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from the Flint River. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, with approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

Mr. Benjamin H. Grumbles, Acting Assistant Administrator 
United States Environmental Protection Agency 
Washington, DC 20460 


Dear Mr. Grumbles: 

SUBJECT: State Programs to Control Lead in School Drinking Water 

Thank you for your letter of March 18, 2004, requesting information on efforts being 
taken by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to control lead in 
drinking water at schools and day care facilities. The following information has been 
assembled by staff in our Water Division (WD) having the regulatory responsibility for 
public water systems. 

The WD continues to actively implement the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule 
(LCR) authorized by the 1986 amendments to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 

1976 PA 399, as amended. In Michigan, we have approximately 900 schools and day 
care centers that meet the definition of a nontransient noncommunity (NTNC) public 
water system. All of these systems rely on groundwater as their source. Fortunately, 
groundwater in Michigan is not typically corrosive or conducive to significant lead 
leaching from water system components. 

As specified by the LCR, routine monitoring for lead and copper has been and 
continues to be conducted in these NTNC systems. Our experience has shown lead 
levels to be acceptable in these schools and day care centers when samples have been 
correctly collected from actual drinking water taps. From 1999 to 2003, the MDEQ 
laboratory analyzed 14,207 lead samples from NTNC public water systems. Only 
2.4 percent of these sample results exceeded the lead action level of 15 parts per billion 
(ppb). Over 94 percent of these results reported lead levels less than or equal to half 
the lead action level of 7,5 ppb, with 37 percent reporting lead as not detected. On the 
rare occasion that one of these NTNC systems exceeded the lead action level, the 
owners have typically eliminated exposure by supplying bottled water or removing the 
offending tap until a long-term solution has been instituted. Rarely have the elevated 
lead levels been attributed to a system-wide problem. In Michigan, it has been 
repeatedly demonstrated that elevated lead levels from drinking water taps in schools 
are diminished by fixture replacement. In the last 5 years, we have had only 10 action 
level exceedences reported from a totai of 1,750 NTNC public water systems. Only 
two of these systems have had to install corrosion control treatment.

Mr. Benjamin H. Grumbles

In your letter, you state that schools are only subject to the requirements of the LCR if 
they have their own water system. This statement implies there is no benefit to those 
schools served by community public water systems. The WD feels strongly that the 
LCR does provide a significant benefit to schools and day care centers that are served 
by community public water systems (CPWS). Despite limitations in these regulations 
that severely restrict CPWS from using schools and day care centers as sampling sites, 
proper implementation of this regulation should result in reduced lead exposure for ail 
customers. For instance, schools and day care centers connected to CPWS serving 
more than 50,000 residents benefited from the LCR because these water systems have 
had to demonstrate and maintain optimal corrosion control. These large systems were 
required to reduce lead levels throughout their water system to the lowest levels 
possible. In addition, schools and day care centers connected to CPWS serving 
50,000 or fewer residents have benefited from proper implementation of the LCR 
because these water systems have had to achieve and maintain compliance with the 
lead action level. Furthermore, any CPWS that exceeded a lead action level also had to 
provide public notification and public service announcements in accordance with and on 
a frequency specified by the LCR. Therefore, schools and day care centers in these 
systems could choose to provide an alternate drinking water source until compliance 
was achieved and lead levels were reduced in their CPWS. 

Your letter also references the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA) of 1988, which 
recalled drinking water coolers with lead-lined water reservoir tanks and banned new 
drinking water coolers with lead parts. This law caused Michigan's state plumbing 
board to make changes in the construction code to ban lead materials in other drinking 
water system components as well. Items such as 50/50 lead-tin solder for household 
plumbing, lead packers and lead wool used for well screens, and brass fixtures having 
greater than 8 percent lead were among the items banned from future use in potable 
water systems. 

In 1988, prior to the LCCA, NTNC schools in Michigan were informed of the requirement 
to provide public notice regarding the potential for lead in drinking water, and they were 
mailed an example notice to use. All Michigan schools supplied by CPWS were also 
mailed the same information with a recommendation that they provide similar public 
notice although it was not required by law. 

In 1989, over 8,000 Michigan schools and day care centers were mailed information on 
the LCCA. We cited concerns about lead levels and recommended a sampling and 
flushing protocol be instituted at all taps used for consumption, not just the water 
coolers required by the LCCA. In addition, staff of the WD made presentations to state 
school business officials and to the environmental health association representing local 
health departments. Articles were also published in school and day care association 
newsletters. 


Mr. Benjamin H. Grumbles 
Page 3 
April 21, 2004 


In 1989, we also conducted a random telephone survey of 40 schools and 40 day care 
centers (both NTNC and those connected to another water system) regarding the 
LCCA, Seventy-five percent of the schools were aware of the LCCA requirements and 
50 percent had performed some monitoring, while 40 percent of the day care centers 
were aware of the LCCA requirements, and about 20 percent had sampled. 

In 1990, a second mailing to all 8,000 schools and day care centers was conducted, 
with updated information on the recall of water coolers as required by the LCCA and 
with the recommendations developed in Michigan on flushing drinking water outlets. In 
this letter, we also asked that any sample results be reported to us even though they 
were specifically not required to do so by the LCCA, About 30 of 500 school districts 
reported results from 720 “first draw” samples taken in over 200 buildings; 2.5 percent 
of these results exceeded the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 50 ppb in effect at 
that time for lead, 8,6 percent exceeded 20 ppb, and 17.5 percent exceeded 10 ppb. It 
should be noted that all (104) flushed sample results reported lead levels less than 
10 ppb. We also noted that the overall average levels in first draw samples collected 
from kitchen faucets were higher than levels from the targeted lead lined water coolers 
that were the focus of the LCCA. As a result of this data, state staff did pilot testing in 
three school districts and provided technical assistance to schools and day care 
centers. Follow-up sampling and investigations were also accomplished by state staff in 
other school districts. 

As you mentioned, the LCCA also established a technical assistance program to 
support state activities to reduce lead contamination in schools. The WD is aware of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) technical assistance fact 
sheets, technical bulletins training seminars, and the publication, “Lead in School 
Drinking Water.” As discussed, we conducted several mailings, made numerous 
presentations, conducted follow-up surveys, responded to requests for assistance, 
participated in several pilot tests to reduce lead levels, compiled data, conducted 
additional sampling, and responded to many telephone inquiries with appropriate 
technical assistance. All of these activities constitute our technical assistance program. 
However, no funding has ever been allocated to states for implementation of the LCCA. 
All of the activities performed by Michigan in response to the requirements of the LCCA 
were done so with resources diverted from other programs. The primary requirement of 
the LCCA was for schools that identified coolers on a list of those suspected to contain 
lead lining to repair, replace, remove, or sample to show that these coolers did not 
contribute to lead in the drinking water, if the schools did sample, they were also 
required to tell their customers that results were available. If schools had no coolers on 
the list, nothing further was required by the LCCA. Despite this limited application of the 
LCCA, Michigan has performed numerous activities beyond the scope specified in the 
LCCA without any federal funding, 


Mr. Benjamin H. Grumbles

Finally, you ask what the USEPA can do to further efforts in this voluntary program. We 
have several suggestions. First, we recommend that the USEPA consider allowing 
schools to be considered Tier 1 sampling sites in CPWS so that we can gain more 
information on possible lead exposure in schools. Allowing CPWS to use schools will 
afford them an opportunity to use sampling sites that are more accessible than private 
homes, more likely to be geographically distributed throughout their system, and likely 
to satisfy a large constituency (parents). From our experience, we also recommend that 
the USEPA consider a sampling protocol for schools that would determine if the fixtures 
at kitchen taps are a problem that could be simply resolved by replacement. The 
USEPA may also want to consider requiring the owner of these facilities to replace any 
remaining lead service lines supplying schools or day care centers. 

In conclusion, we understand that the detection of elevated lead levels at customer taps 
in Washington, DC, has caused the USEPA to focus on this issue. However, the MDEQ 
wants to emphasize that despite the limitations in this law, proper implementation of the 
LCR accomplishes adequate reduction in lead levels, Failure to carry out some rule 
provisions in one case should not be cause for disparaging implementation across the 
country, or for unnecessary revamping of this regulation. If you need further information 
or assistance, please contact Mr. James K. Cleland, Assistant Division Chief, WD, at 
517-241-1287, or you may contact me. 



Sinc^ly,

Chemical testing could have predicted Flint's water crisis

Press) 


Chemical tests could have predicted the corrosion in the pipes that is now being blamed for endangering the 
health of thousands of vulnerable Flint residents by elevating lead levels in their water supply, experts say. 

As the city scrambles to reconnect to the Detroit water system, the absence of such testing on the Flint River 
water is one of many missed opportunities that might have lessened or avoided the crisis, they say. 

“Any competent person should have seen this water will eat up iron and eat up lead,” Marc Edwards, a Virginia 
Tech professor and national expert on pipe corrosion, told the Free Press. Edwards said his own research 
shows that Flint River water, without additional controls, corrodes the lead inside pipes at 19 times the rate of 
water piped from Detroit.

Among red flags that popped up over the last 18 months: 

• General Motors announced in October 2014 that it was pulling its engine plant off Flint water after workers there began noticing rust spots on newly 
machined parts. The city approved letting GM switch to water from Flint Township, but didn't change its own water treatment procedures. 

• The University of Michigan-Flint alerted city officials that it found elevated lead levels in its water in January, prompting the school to shut off some 
some drinking fountains and add water filters to others. 

• Testing in the fall of 2014 found E. coli in the city's water system, prompting "boil water" notices. The city's procedures for killing the E. coli produced 
chemical by-products known as trihalomethanes, which can cause cancer with long-term exposure. The city had to adopt additional measures to reduce 
them. 

“Common sense tells you that the Flint River is not your first choice of drinking water,” said Shawn McElmurry, who teaches civil and environmental 
engineering at Wayne State University and has followed Flint closely.

Experts say the testing could have been done before the switch from the Detroit system. But officials from the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality note that that kind of testing isn’t required under federal drinking-water rules and has never been done in Michigan. What’s more, they said, the 
Flint River water, treated in the city’s plant, was already approved as a backup supply in case of interrupted service from Detroit. 

Other experts said the testing is more nuanced, part art and part science. Still, they acknowledge that by examining things such as the acidity of water 
and other factors, engineers could have estimated how much corrosion to expect once water from the Flint River was pumped into homes and 
businesses across the city. 

“Not every engineer in our field could do it, it's a pretty specialized area," said David Cornwell, a Virginia-based engineering consultant and a technical 
adviser to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council, a group of experts that works with the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water 
issues.

The fix now will cost $12 million — a combination of money from the state, the city and the Flint-based non-profit C.S. Mott Foundation, which has 
pledged $4 million to help pay Detroit for the water while Flint waits to connect to a new water authority in partnership with Genesee County. 

Water woes began shortly after switch from Detroit 

Flint began using Flint River water as its main supply in April 2014. Before that, it bought Lake Huron water that was treated and delivered by the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department. Detroit ended that deal one day after Flint voted to join Genesee County in forming the Karegnondi Water Authority, 
which plans to build its own Lake Huron intake and pipe the water to the Flint Water Plant. 

Flint officials wanted to remain on Detroit's system, but the two sides couldn't agree on a price and a contract length. 

Once the switch to river water was made, the city, which was operating under a state-appointed emergency financial manager, faced one problem after 
another. Residents packed city council meetings and held protest marches to voice their anger about water quality. 

Experts say Flint's lead problems could have been held in check if the city had added phosphates to the water, as Detroit has done for years. The 
treatment doesn't eliminate lead entirely, but it does form a film over the pipes themselves, effectively sealing in the lead and reducing the amount in the 
water to acceptable levels. 

But when Flint switched to river water, it didn't add phosphates. Instead it added lime to soften the water. 

“The lime softening process has the added benefit of some corrosion control,” said Liane Smith, chief of Michigan’s Office of Drinking Water and 
Municipal Assistance. 

Smith said that once the switch was made, the state began testing for lead and copper, as is required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 

“Any new supply that comes along has to do two six-month rounds of monitoring for lead and copper out in their distribution system,” Smith said. If those 
tests show corrosion, additional steps, such as perhaps adding phosphates, are supposed to be followed. 

The first round oftesting completed in December 2014 showed lead levels of 6 parts per billion. The second round, completed in June of this year, 
showed they had almost doubled to 1 1 parts per billion. The EPA requires a remediation plan when levels reach 1 5 parts per billion and can demand 
action even below that mark on systems that serve more than 50,000 people. 

Cornwell said phosphates are considered more effective than lime softening and they don’t raise treatment costs substantially. But they have side effects, 
he said. 

“The negative is that nobody really likes phosphates out in the environment,” he said, noting they can find their way into rivers and lakes, fueling algae 
blooms such as the ones in Lake Erie. 

“There is more to it than saying we're just going to pump phosphates,” Cornwell said. “You may have to make other adjustments.”

since last year. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) 


Flint River water a challenge to clean up 

Flint River water was always going to pose more treatment challenges than the cold, clear water that comes from the bottom of Lake Huron, experts said. 

The river has been marked by decades of industrial pollution. Its tributaries channel farmland run-off into it and its temperature varies by season. Warmer 
water can promote bacteria growth. All of those factors make treating it to drinking-water standards more difficult. 

"The city was doing the best it could” to clean up pollutants, Edwards said, but added that corrosivity was inevitable 

He blamed the problems on a lack of expertise rather than intentional wrongdoing. 

“I think it started relatively innocently. They didn’t understand testing and they didn’t understand corrosivity,” he said. 

Last month, Edwards' research group released results of corrosion tests it conducted on Flint's water. For the test, researchers used copper pipe with 
lead solder, which is common in older homes. 

The tests showed Flint River water without added phosphates corroded the lead at 1 9 times the rate of Detroit water. Even when phosphates were 
added, it corroded at 16 times the rate of the Detroit water. 

“From the second it was switched, it was doomed from the lead problem,” Edwards said. 

When residents began complaining about the water, the city and state should have begun to rethink their testing, Edwards said. 

Problems were evident soon after the switch. 

In August last year, E. coli was found in the water and residents were urged to boil it before drinking it. The city treated it with disinfectant, but that 
produced by-products in the water known as trihalomethanes. Long-term exposure to them can cause cancer, so the city began making treatment 
adjustments. 

Then as summer turned to fall, workers at Flint’s GM engine plant began seeing rust on newly machined engine parts. GM's lab tests found high levels of 
chloride in the water used to wash down metal shavings and cool parts heated from the rapid machining action inside the plant, GM spokesman Tom 
Wickham said. 

GM tried to treat the water in the plant. It had drinking water delivered and tankers brought water for operations, Wickham said. 

But it eventually sought to connect to Flint Township's water system, which is supplied by Detroit. 

In December the connection was finalized and Detroit water began flowing to the plant, via Flint Township.

Chemical testing could have predicted Flint's water crisis 

In January 2015, lead was showing up at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus. School leaders become concerned about the water supply after the 
city issued "boil water" advisories to kill E. coli and realized they’d never done routine, thorough water testing. 

Tests in January and February showed elevated levels of lead and other problems in isolated areas — specifically in two infrequently used drinking 
fountains in two older buildings. 

Follow-up testing found other elevated levels of lead, and those sinks and fountains then were either fitted with filters or removed, said Mike Lane, 
director of the environment, health and safety department 

He said officials suspected the problem was in their pipes but notified the city anyway. 

In June, Miguel Del Toral of the Environmental Protection Agency drafted an internal memo noting the problems Flint had experienced with E. coli and 
the by-products of the chemicals used to treat it. 

"A major concern from a public health standpoint is lack of corrosion control treatment in the city of Flint for mitigating lead and copper levels in the 
drinking water," Del Toral wrote. 

The memo caused a stir when the American Civil Liberties Union exposed it. But the EPA told the Free Press on Friday that the memo was a draft that 
was never delivered to MDEQ officials, including Smith, whose names appear on it. 

The EPA did say it discussed the concerns raised in the memo with MDEQ officials in July, but the agency did not respond immediately to a request for 
details. 

Leaching lead not unique to Flint 

The problem of lead leaching into drinking water isn't unique to Flint. Across Michigan and around the country, pipes that carry water from the mains 
under the street into homes, businesses and schools often contain lead. Inside homes and business, many older plumbing fixtures and soldered pipes 
also contain it. 

Cornwell said officials from across the nation have formed a working group to review the lead and copper rules and look for ways to improve them. 
Among the things being considered is a national effort to remove lead pipes from water systems. 

But even if a national consensus formed around that idea, the process would take years, Cornwell said. A funding source for such a massive project also 
would be needed. 

Still, he said, removing the pipes is the only surefire way to eliminate lead from the system. 

"We can only do so much with water chemistry," he said. "We can only turn the knob so much."

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The preliminary list of schools is completed, has been circulated to DHFIS, and 
has been provided to DLARA to begin plumbing assessments. The list will 
remain active in case of additional schools requesting assessment/testing. 

• DLARA to coordinate with Flint Schools on access for plumbing assessments. 
Tap coding identification from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
guidance to be provided to DLARA. 

• Preliminary comments on sampling instructions were received by voice mail from 
EPA. Need to discuss directly. 

• DEQ comments provided to MDARD on information for restaurants, and a draft 
was forwarded to DHHS for their comments. 

• Approve Flint plan for water line - The city of Flint and Genesee County flushed 
the pipeline beginning October 13; the first set of samples for total coliform 
analysis was collected around 2:30 a.m. Genesee County planned to collect 
their second sample for bacteriological analysis between 6 and 8 p.m. last night. 
It may take additional time to flush the Dort Reservoir before it is ready to be 
sampled and may set back the time that the pipeline is ready to be placed into 
operation (October 15 is the soonest possible). The yard piping configuration at 
the Flint Water Treatment Plant does allow for flexibility in operation and ability to 
take Dort out of service and maintain supply from Detroit; however, we have not 
been able to confirm that this is the way Flint plans to proceed. 

• An e-mail was sent to DHHS regarding the lead education plan for schools for 
drinking water to determine if DEQ or DHHS will be the lead and to determine 
how this effort will be coordinated with broader lead education/outreach efforts. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted regarding scheduling regular meetings with 
DEQ, and the initial meeting is tentatively scheduled for Friday, October 16. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted to schedule a tour of the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant. It is tentatively scheduled to occur in conjunction with the initial 
meeting. Logistics may require postponement until the week of October 19. 

• DHHS has been contacted, and they have indicated that as of 9:30 a.m. on 
October 13, there has been no formal request for an emergency declaration.

• John O’Brien, Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office, was contacted. 

The most significant bottleneck to expedite completion of the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) pipeline involves road restrictions currently being imposed by 
the Lapeer County Road Commission and include: 

o All Lapeer County secondary north-south roads are tagged “no 

construction traffic” for this project except for primary roads (M-19, M-53, 
and M-24). This significantly increases distances that construction 
vehicles must travel (upwards of 15 to 20 miles) to accomplish a short jog 
either north or south. 

o Weight restrictions in the spring will cause construction to slow or stop for 
one to two months. Lapeer County has indicated that St. Clair and 
Sanilac are not imposing the weight restrictions; however, Lapeer County 
will maintain their restrictions. 

• DEQ staff indicated there is another potentially serious bottleneck concerning 
construction of the KWA pipeline. A “stop-work” order could be coming soon 
from the Lapeer County Road Commission. 

• Samir Matta from Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN), Flint’s consultant, 
was contacted for an update on the corrosion control plan and submittal of the 
Act 399 permit application. Flint operators, with the assistance of LAN, 
conducted bench tests using a corrosion inhibitor (orthophosphate) and are 
making comparisons for use with (treated water from Detroit vs. water treated 
from the Flint River). LAN is currently preparing plans and a design for 
installation of an orthophosphate feed system. LAN expects to submit the 

Act 399 permit application to the DEQ by no later than the end of this week.

• Supplemental appropriations bill (Flouse Bill 4102) passed in the House 105-0 on 
October 14 and in the Senate 37-0 on October 15. 

• E-mail sent to DLARA with draft sampling ID protocol. 

• E-mail drafted with request for schools to prepare documents/information ahead 
of DLARA visit and on-site assessment. Waiting for comments. 

• MDARD incorporated input from DEQ for the guidance document to restaurants. 
The final version is being reviewed for inclusion on the Web site. 

• The pipeline was flushed, and the 1 st round of samples for bacteriological 
analysis collected yesterday (4:00 a.m. at mid-point and 7:30 a.m. at CS #3 - 
Flint Water Treatment Plant) were non-detect for total coliform. 

• The 2nd round of samples were collected yesterday evening at mid-point 
(Genesee County) and late last night at CS #3 (Flint). Results will be available 
later this evening and read first thing tomorrow morning. If the 2nd set of 
samples is all clear, the pipeline will be ready to be placed into service (from a 
technical standpoint). The pipeline, however, will not be placed into service until 
Flint, Genesee County, and Detroit agree on and establish a service contract. 

• The Dort Reservoir will not be placed into service (this facility can be bypassed) 
until Flint determines what to do with the 6 million gallons of water (chlorinated at 
approximately 1 00 parts per million). What they thought was a connection to the 
sanitary sewer was discovered yesterday to be a connection to the storm sewer. 

• The first weekly meeting with the city of Flint has been scheduled for October 1 6. 
Attendees will include: Natasha Henderson (city of Flint), George Krisztian 
(DEQ), Shelly Edgerton (DLARA), Linda Dykema (DHHS), and Dr. Eden Wells 
(DHHS). 

• A tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been requested and tentatively 
scheduled for October 16. We are waiting for confirmation from city of Flint 
officials. Due to potential scheduling conflicts, this may be rescheduled for the 
week of October 19. 

• The initial draft of the sampling protocol has been submitted to EPA, and 
comments have been received.

• Potential bottlenecks have been identified regarding load restrictions. Further 
discussions with the Lapeer County Road Commission will be necessary to 
identify potential accommodations. 

Additional action: 

Outreach was made to the Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) to ask for 
assistance with the sampling of Flint schools. The GCHD has expressed some 
reservations, and further communication will take place to strengthen the partnership.

• Based upon discussions with Genesee County and the city of Flint, the portion of 
the 72-inch transmission main (pipeline) that was taken out of service, while the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant treated water from the Flint River, was flushed and 
disinfected in accordance to AWWA Standard C651-14. Two sets of samples 
were collected from two locations 16 hours apart for total coliform analysis. The 
city of Flint and Genesee County have informed the DEQ that both sets of 
samples were non-detect for total coliform. Based upon the disinfection 
procedure and the absence of total coliform from both sets of samples, the 
unused portion of the pipeline may be placed into service. 

• The initial meeting with the city of Flint has been confirmed and scheduled to 
take place at the Flint City Flail today at 1 0:00 a.m. In attendance will be 
representatives from DEQ, DLARA, DHHS, and the city of Flint. The meeting will 
cover progress by each partner to date, along with a discussion of action items 
for next week and the following: 

o Get update on service line index card conversion and identify where 
partial replacements exist 

o Make sure DHHS gets information so they can cross reference 

• Due to scheduling conflicts, the tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been 
postponed until the week of October 1 9. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted regarding the delivery of homeowner 
samples, and it was agreed that the current method of sample delivery was 
mutually beneficial and that the practice would remain in place. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted, and they have agreed to forward all lead 
testing requests by businesses directly to the DEQ laboratory. The DEQ 
laboratory contact information has been provided, and the city of Flint has 
distributed this information to appropriate staff. 

Additional action: 

A meeting has been requested between the DEQ and the Genesee County Health 

Department (GCFID). A request to meet has been sent along with a list of proposed 

agenda items. A proposal for weekly meetings either by phone or in person has been 

made to GCFID so as to strengthen our partnership with them.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The Flint pipeline is ready and has been placed into service. Water from the 
Great Lakes Water Authority began flowing on Friday, October 16. 

• Continued working with Karegnondi Water Authority toward addressing the 
construction bottlenecks. 

• The corrosion control proposal was received electronically from Lockwood, 
Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN), Flint’s consultant, on October 16 (without 399 
application). Staff is reviewing the proposal and preparing comments. The 
proposal was forwarded to EPA for their review, with comments requested by 
October 19. EPA acknowledged receipt of the proposal. On October 16 LAN 
hand delivered a full-sized set of the proposal, along with a signed permit 
application. 

• The city of Flint provided information during the initial coordination meeting that 
approximately 25% of the index card conversion has taken place. The cards 
have been given to the University of Michigan-Flint for entry into GIS. The city of 
Flint has indicated that this is a slow process, and they are looking at ways to 
speed up the process. This is a manually intensive process, and they lack the 
resources to accomplish the task faster. 

• The city of Flint will provide a link to the GIS mapping, and Howard Croft of the 
city of Flint gave a short presentation on how to use the GIS mapping program. 

Additional Actions: 

• George Krisztian and Karen Tommasulo represented the DEQ in the initial 
weekly coordination meeting with the city of Flint on October 1 6. Present were 
representatives from DEQ, DLARA, DHHS, and the city of Flint. Each partner 
provided a brief synopsis of what their respective group had done the past week, 
and there was discussion on action steps for the following week. Additional 
discussion included presenting a unified message, creation of a homeowners 
water sampling instructions work group, and inclusion of the Genesee County 
Health Department (GCHD) for the weekly coordination meetings. 

• George Krisztian, Karen Tommasulo, and Liane Shekter Smith represented the 
DEQ in an October 16 meeting with the Flint Community Schools 
Superintendent, Bilal Tawwab. Also present were representatives from DLARA, 
DHHS, and the Principals from the first three schools that are going through the 
plumbing evaluation protocol as well as additional staff from Flint Community 
Schools. The DEQ provided an overview of the protocol that includes a plumbing

evaluation, subsequent sampling of all faucets and drinking fountains that are 
used for consumptive purposes, analysis of the samples, consolidation of the 
data, and then review of the data from a health-based exposure perspective. 
There was also discussion that the GCHD would be asked to conduct the 
sampling so that we ensure all aspects of the data are of the highest possible 
quality. There was also discussion of the need to ensure that the 
Superintendent’s office receives the data along with comments on the data 
before the data is made public. It was agreed that all partners (DEQ, DLARA, 
DHHS, the Superintendent, the city of Flint, and GCHD) would all be provided the 
data along with context before the data was released to the public. It was also 
agreed that there needed to be coordination with respect to who would be 
releasing the data to the public. 

• George Krisztian, Karen Tommasulo, and Liane Shekter Smith met on 

October 16 with James Henry of the GCHD. The purpose of the meeting was to: 

o Invite the GCHD to attend the weekly coordination meeting with the city of 
Flint. 

o Ask if the GCHD would be willing to take the samples for the school 
plumbing evaluations. 

o Invite Mr. Henry to be part of the homeowners water sampling instructions 
work group. 

o The GCHD provided a positive response on all three subjects but did 

indicate that they would need funding to assist with the sampling. GCHD 
was asked to submit a request to the DEQ so that the question of funding 
could be addressed formally.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• On October 1 6 DEQ staff calculated an estimate for the number of samples that 
we expect to take per school. During our October 16 meeting with Flint 
Community Schools representatives, they supported our assumptions. Based on 
this, we estimate that if we collect 3 samples at each drinking water/cooking tap 
at each school, we can expect to collect approximately 100 samples per school 
(13 schools = 1 ,300 samples). This number is only for the first 1 3 locations that 
were identified in the preliminary investigation. A more comprehensive 
determination of the total number of facilities will be made after the initial pilot of 
3 schools is complete. 

• Draft language changes for Part 54 of the Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection Act, 1994 PA 451 , as amended, have been submitted to Maggie 
Pallone for review before final submission. 

• The revised draft sampling protocol was shared with DLARA, DHHS, EPA, and 
Genesee County Health Department on October 19 for comment. 

• DEQ’s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance staff is scheduled to 
observe DLARA staff conducting a plumbing assessment on October 21 . 

• Initial comments by EPA regarding Flint’s proposed corrosion control treatment 
plan were received on October 19. EPA’s comments in their entirety are 
included as an attachment. DEQ staff has been instructed to contact EPA on 
October 20 to get clarification of some of the comments. 

• On October 19 George Krisztian contacted Howard Croft, Public Works Director, 
city of Flint, to find out how the transition to Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) was going. Mr. Croft indicated that Flint switched over in a 
controlled manner so as to minimize disruptions in the infrastructure. He said 
that the transition went very smoothly and that Flint is on DWSD water 

1 00 percent. Mr. Croft also indicated that they would be doing testing throughout 
the distribution system and they would be focusing on hardness levels to 
determine the extent to which the DWSD water had made it through the system. 
He anticipated that it would be a full week before there was a complete turnover 
of the source water.

Subject: RE: Flint WTP PH2 SEG4 - Corrosion Control 

Mike, 

Thank-you for giving us the opportunity to review the city of Flint's corrosion control plan. 

We believe it is necessary that Flint boosts orthophosphate dosage. Given that the distribution system 
has not received orthophosphate in over a year, we expect that orthophosphate will need to be boosted 
to 1) meet the demand of the distribution system, 2) reach the service lines and other lead-containing 
components in premise plumbing, and 3) accelerate lead reduction at the consumer’s taps. 
Orthophosphate should preferably be added in the same form as the Detroit source which is phosphoric 
acid from our understanding. This is the proposed case here, however, a simple test should be 
performed to make sure that the pH is not impacted in a significant way at the desired target dose. 


We have not been able to obtain comprehensive water quality data for the finished water 
characteristics of the Detroit water that will be fed to Flint, to assess ranges of major chemical 
characteristic fluctuations. However, based upon the email trail, Detroit water entering the Flint system 
appears to only contain around 0.4 PG4/L. This concentration range is entirely too low compared to that 
needed in studies presented and published in the last 20+ years that have focused on lead released 
directly from lead pipes, and the solubility of the most likely lead orthophosphate pipes scales. We also 
strongly feel that targeted dose of 0.8 mg P04/L is aiso too low, for the very same reason. We would be 
glad to share wi th you numerous standard corrosion control and treatment reference works, best 
practices guides and published results from US and international lead corrosion control field and pilot 
studies. Secondly, the basis for that target (other communities using Lake Huron source use the same 
dose) is not scientifically derived nor does it consider water quality and the current state of Flint's 
distribution system. We have reviewed the original Detroit corrosion study and have seen some of the 
LCR monitoring data, and besides the fact that it did not directly pertain to this water source, few 
dosages were tested in the cited 1994 pipe loop study, and the higher dosage than the one 
implemented in the field currently was more effective. Based on the limited amount of data on the 
quality of Detroit water, what we know about the history of Detroit corrosion control, we think an 
orthophosphate residua! of 3 to 4 mg PQ4/L should be the minimum starting test target residual for pipe 
passivation, it is likely that, at least initially a higher dosage will be necessary to reach the far ends of 
the distribution system and sufficiently reduce lead solubility and release from ail lead sources. To allow 
flexibility, we feel the design of the chemical feed and storage systems should he able to consistently 
deliver a maximum dose of 5 to 6 mg P04/L, if substantial orthophosphate loss is observed, if the 
starting dose is set for the desired residual level of 3 to 4 mg/L as P04. We suggest that jar tests be 
performed in advance of orthophosphate addition to Detroit water to evaluate the impact of 
orthophosphate dose on turbidity that could result from interactions between orthophosphate and 
background Detroit water quality parameters (e.g., aluminum, calcium, etc.}. 

We want to stress that immediately shifting to Detroit water and adding orthophosphate will not 
necessarily translate to immediate improvements. Furthermore, this is a change, albeit a return to past 
conditions. Nonetheless, a period of system upset should he anticipated. The need for a communication 
strategy and a distribution system plan are critical. 



Lastly., we see no mention of a water qualify monitoring program. Two programs need to be put in place 
immediately (before return to Detroit water) to 1} identify lead sources, 2) assess treatment 
effectiveness against lead release from ail of the simultaneously operating mechanisms (solubility, 
particulate release, galvanic corrosion), and 3) assess orthophosphate levels and stability of water 
quality in the distribution system. 

There are multiple sources of lead in the Flint distribution system to the consumers' taps, such as: pipes; 
leaded brass; leaded solder; accumulations on old galvanized steel pipes; possibly accumulated on 
copper or some plastic pipes, it is critical that the fate of orthophosphate in the distribution system is 
understood, and how effective it is against each type of lead source, so dosing adjustment can be 
properly made. For this purpose, we recommend that a number of residences throughout Flint that 
meet the following plumbing criteria, be identified for an assessment of the contribution lead from the 
different potential service line and interior plumbing sources, through detailed mapping of plumbing 
materials, lengths, sizes, and location and type of inline devices and faucets using profile sampling. For 
confidence in interpretation, probably at least 5 sites from each of the configurations will be 
necessary. The configurations we would estimate to be most important (but should be changed or 
added to if local construction practice indicates it's necessary): Lead service line, galvanized steel 
Interior plumbing; lead service line, copper with leaded solder joints; lead service line, plastic interior 
plumbing. It is also possible that interior plumbing may differ from the material used for the customer- 
side service line segment. We would be glad to discuss the specifics of this sampling effort. 

For the purpose of assessing stability of water quality in the distribution system and to inform on 
orthophosphate residual adjustment, we suggest that 8 to 10 locations in the distribution system be 
selected to measure pH, alkalinity, orthophosphate, turbidity and iron on a weekly basis. These could be 
collected from TCR sampling locations, or other readiiy-aecessible buildings, should be located at a 
distribution of locations in the distribution system and should be collected after a flush sufficiently long 
to assure that "fresh" distribution system water is being measured. Research has shown that over time, 
orthophosphate can reduce disinfectant demand associated with corroding metallic distribution system 
materials. These measurements need to be performed in the field and can simply be done with a 
portable HACH test kit or spectrophotometer. 


A lead sampling plan needs to be in place to access the effectiveness of water change and treatment 
boost, ICR monitoring sites with confirmed lead service lines can be in the sampling pool. Sampling 
should consist of a 1 liter first draw sample (LCR sample without 5 minute pre-flush), followed by an 
additional flushed sample or two depending on profile sample results which is intended to capture 
major lead source(s). The specific details of this effort need to be worked out by the technical 
committee as soon as possible. We would gladly w'ork with Flint on establishing a water sampling 
program to identity and verify lead service line sites. The pian and initial sampling effort should be 
performed before the switch so that one baseline sample set is collected. 


Lastly, our strength does not fall under full-scale pump and chemical feed delivery systems. We would 
only say that the systems need to be scaled-up in size to accommodate our suggested dosing needs. 
Also, there is the some discussion about diverting water to the Dort reservoir and an associated 
orthophosphate feed system. We are not familiar with the reservoir but are wondering if it is an open 
reservoir? 



Of course this is a Sot of information to share and we would gladly be available to discuss the technical 
and scientific basis for our suggestions. 

Let us know if you have any questions and thanks again,

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

• DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 
representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHHS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 1 6, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 

• Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCHD is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 

• DHHS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The initial meeting for the internal After Action Plan is scheduled for October 22. 
The purpose of the meeting is to define the scope of the internal review, create a 
detailed time line, connect all communications together to determine where 
communications could have been improved, and create a list of lessons learned 
and action steps moving forward. 

• Madhu Anderson has provided information for the creation of an external After 
Action Review Panel. The Panel members have been selected, and a press 
release was issued by the Governor’s office on October 21 . 

• The DEQ Laboratory, working in conjunction with MDOT’s Accounting Services 
Division, has created the necessary billing codes to allow payment for the lead 
and copper samples from the city of Flint to be processed. 

• The EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force (Task Force) has provided 
comments to staff in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance 
(ODWMA) on the sampling protocol. These comments are being reviewed, and 
ODWMA staff is continuing to finalize the protocol. 

• The logistics for the initial plumbing evaluation and subsequent water sampling 
have been finalized among staff from DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS. The plumbing 
inspection is scheduled for Friday, October 23, and the water samples will be 
taken on Saturday, October 24. 

• DEQ staff is responding to comments on the corrosion control proposal made by 
the EPA’s Task Force. DEQ staff is following up on questions raised during the 
October 20 conference call. 

• A monitoring schedule letter is expected to be mailed on October 22. The 
monitoring schedule addresses the change back to a customer supply of the 
Great Lakes Water Authority. A final copy of the letter will be attached to 
tomorrow’s update. 

Additional Actions: 

• At the request of Representative Sheldon Neeley, George Krisztian contacted 
Carlita Earl, Principal of the Eagle’s Nest Academy. Ms. Earl has formally 
requested that Eagle’s Nest Academy receive a plumbing evaluation and water 
sampling as outlined in the newly-developed school assessment protocol. 

Ms. Earl was informed that she would be added to the list of schools being 
evaluated and that the original 13 Flint Community Schools buildings would be 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


evaluated first and then the DEQ/DLARA/DHHS would expand the evaluation 
process to charter schools, parochial schools, and other childcare facilities. 

Ms. Earl was informed that since the Eagle’s Nest Academy serves children in 
grades K-4 that they would be placed at the top of the list once the evaluations of 
the original 13 buildings are complete. 

• Director Dan Wyant, Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo, and George Krisztian met 
with a group of pastors and citizens who came to Constitution Hall to voice their 
concerns regarding the water in Flint. The discussion lasted for approximately 
one hour, and the topics included a history of events, questions regarding how 
decisions were made, and the plan moving forward. The group indicated that 
they had read a great deal in the media and were interested in finding out what 
DEQ’s perspective of the situation was. The questions were tough, but the 
conversation was very respectful. The group was informed that an independent 
group external to the DEQ would be conducting an After Action Review, and this 
information seemed to be well-received. 

• Shelly Edgerton of DLARA spoke to Eric Swanson of DTMB, who is going to call 
Howard Croft, Public Works Director, city of Flint, about the GIS program that the 
city of Flint is trying to run. Eric will follow up with Shelly after the conversation. 

In addition, DLARA will be meeting again with the city of Flint.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The initial After Action Plan meeting was held on October 22. Topics covered 
were: 

o The discussion of the roles of each team member 
o The scope of the After Action Plan 

o The time frame in which the After Action Plan is to be completed 
The main components of the After Action Plan are: 

o An After Action Review Summary time line that details critical events in 
chronological order, asking key questions, and providing explanations for 
actions taken 

o Implementation of the Governor’s 10-point Action Plan 
o An evaluation of if DEQ made mistakes and, if so, what they were 

o An evaluation of lessons learned, defining what we can do better/differently 

in the future 

• Participated on an October 22 conference call with the EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking 
Water Task Force to discuss proposed sampling protocol and the comments 
received from EPA. Agreed to reconvene a call next week to discuss how the 
pilot sampling effort goes, what went well, what might need to be adjusted, etc. 

• A summary of our discussion with EPA regarding Flint’s corrosion control plan 
was provided to Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA. The summary 
included confirmation of the actual phosphate dosage from the Detroit Lake 
Huron Water Treatment Plant. 

• Proper dosages are now confirmed, based on incoming phosphate residual at 
Flint. A product cut-sheet to confirm NSF approval and maximum dose is to be 
provided shortly. Flint’s consultant (Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc.) will 
also confirm proper sizing of the feed pumps. Anticipate receiving this 
information on October 23, which will facilitate issuance of the Act 399 permit. 

• An updated monitoring schedule is completed and signed. The schedule will be 
mailed to the city of Flint on October 23. A copy of the updated monitoring 
schedule is attached. 

• An e-mail was sent to John O’Brien of Genesee County informing him of our 
concern over improper soil erosion control measures at the pipeline job site and 
what corrective measures were being taken to avoid a potential halt of 
construction by the Lapeer County Road Commission. Genesee County has not 
responded thus far.

Additional Actions: 

• A conference call was held among representatives from DEQ/DLARA/DHHS to 
further discuss ways to ensure that the efforts of all three agencies were 
coordinated. It was determined that weekly calls providing updates to the group 
as a whole would be beneficial. DEQ also agreed to copy DLARA and DHHS on 
their daily update report to the Governor’s office. 

• Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian contacted Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab to obtain permission to allow the Detroit 
Free Press to take footage of the water sampling process to be conducted at 
Freeman Elementary School on Saturday, October 24. Superintendent Tawwab 
gave his permission, stating that it would not be an issue since there would not 
be any students present. 

• DLARA completed additional review of documents at the Flint repository to assist 
with the sequencing at the schools. 

• Flint is able to provide DLARA plumbing inspectors with on-site workspace; 
additional documentation gives greater guidance on locations for plumbing 
fixtures. 

• DLARA received confirmation from DEQ that bottles and necessary equipment 
will be available for sampling start on Saturday, October 24.

4500 North Dort Highway 

Flint, Michigan 48505 

Dear Mr. Wright: 

SUBJECT: Revised Drinking Water Monitoring Schedule - 2015 
Monthly Operation Reports 
Siting Plans and Record Keeping 

Monitoring Schedule: 

Enclosed is your revised Drinking Water Monitoring Schedule for remainder of calendar 
year 201 5 outlining the minimum requirements for your public water supply. Your 
schedule has been revised based on the City’s change in source of its drinking water 
from the treatment of the Flint River utilizing the City’s Water Treatment Plant to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority/Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collect samples 
early in the monitoring period of the year indicated on the schedule. If you use a private 
laboratory you are required to report the results to us within the first ten days of the 
month following the month that you received the results. To receive credit for 
monitoring, the "WSSN” (water supply serial number), the "Site Code," and "County" 
must appear on the sample result. Bottles will NOT be mailed automatically. If you use 
the Department of Environmental Quality Laboratory, you can order bottles by calling 
517-335-8184. Be certain of the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
sampling and analysis method requirements for hold times. 

Monthly Operation Report (MOR) Requirements: 

The City shall submit MORs as required under Administrative Rule 1502 (R325.11502). 
Please note required coliform bacteria monitoring results and associated chlorine 
residual monitoring shall be submitted to the department within the first 10 days 
following the end of the required monthly monitoring period. In addition, monthly 
operation reports shall be submitted to the department during the month following the 
month for which the monthly operation report was prepared.

Disinfection By-Product Sample Siting Plans: 

The City of Flint shall continue routine standard monitoring of disinfection by-products, 
according to your Disinfection & Disinfectants By-Product (DDBP) plan which identifies 
8 sites for routine quarterly monitoring. 

Lead and Copper Monitoring Requirements and Site Sample Pool 

Please note distribution system monitoring for water quality parameters (WQPs) 
continues at the expanded set of 25 sites per quarter. Lead and copper monitoring in 
accordance with the requirements of Administrative Rule 710a (R325,10710a) is being 
required for the 6 month period between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The City 
must ensure its sample site pool is large enough to collect the number of lead and 
copper tap samples required. All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall 
be selected from the pool of targeted sampling sites. 

The City shall also conduct additional operational monitoring to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of corrosion control treatment. 


Record Keeping: 


The City shall maintain all monitoring records in accordance with all applicable 
requirements under the Administrative Rules including Rule 720a (R325. 10720a), 

Ruie 1506 (R325.1 1506), and Rule 1507 (R325.11507) 

The Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act requires certain reports to be submitted to this 
office each year. Please remember that cross connection reports and annual pumpage 
reports are due by March 31 , and the Consumer Confidence Report is due by July 1 . 


Also enclosed is the document “2015 Monitoring and Reporting Requirements.” This

Community Water Supply 
2015 Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 

Please Monitor Early: Collect samples early in the monitoring period (month, quarter, 
year) of the year indicated on the schedule. Bacteriological and partial chemistry 
samples should be collected close to the shipping time and sent overnight delivery to 
assure sample holding times are not exceeded (30 and 48 hour hold times respectively). 
We also recommend avoiding mailing bacteriological samples immediately preceding or 
following a holiday because samples tend to exceed the 30 hour hold time. When this 
occurs, a repeat sample must be collected as soon as possible upon notification. 

If you use a private laboratory please report the results to us within the first ten days of 
the month following the month that you received the results. A list of certified 
laboratories is available on request. If samples are not collected as indicated on your 
monitoring schedule, you will incur a monitoring violation and possibly a fine. For 
information on the fines policy, visit http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking 
Water, Community Water Supply, and Administrative Fines (under Laws and Rules). 


To receive credit for monitoring, you must include the "WSSN” (water supply serial 
number), the "Site Code," and the "County" when you submit samples for analysis. 
Site codes are listed on your monitoring schedule. 


Special Instructions If You Use The DEQ Laboratory: Bottles will NOT be mailed 
automatically. To order bottles, call the DEQ Laboratory at 517-335-8184 or download 
the form EQP 2301 Requisition for Water Sample Units from www.michigan.gov/deq. 
Click on Key Topics, Laboratory Services, Drinking Water, Obtaining The Necessary 
Sampling Units, and 'test list’. Please note that the DEQ laboratory is closed on most 
state holidays. The DEQ laboratory prices are subject to change without notice. 

Special Instructions For Automated Partial Chemistry, VOC and TTHM Samples : These 
sample bottles must be cooled and preserved during shipment to the laboratory. If you 
use the DEQ laboratory, you will receive the ice pack, acid dropper (if necessary) and 
small cooler when you request the bottles. Samples must be preserved correctly to be 
used for compliance purposes. To avoid resampling follow instructions contained with 
the sample bottle, if you would like more information, contact the DEQ lab, at 
517-335-8184, or contact this office, 

Cyanide : Previously, supplies that chlorinated the water were waived from monitoring 
for cyanide. The U.S. EPA now requires all supplies to sample the entry point for 
cyanide. 

UCMR3 Monitoring : You may have monitoring requirements in 2015 under the third 
Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3). The U.S. EPA will contact you 
directly if your water supply is required to monitor in 2015. A list of laboratories certified 
to analyze the samples collected for UCMR3 is available at 

http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3/upload/iablist.pdf. Contact 
the U.S. EPA with questions.

Reminder if Lead and Copper Monitoring Due This Year : Provide individual lead tap 
results to people who receive water from sites that you sampled, even if lead was not 
detected, within 30 days of learning the results. Send us a certification that you met all 
the delivery requirements along with a sample copy of the customer notice within 3 
months after the end of the monitoring period. Water supplies that failed to distribute the 
Consumer Notice of Lead Results must include the following statement in their CCR, 
"During the year, we failed to provide lead results to persons served at the sites that 
were tested as required by the Lead and Copper Rule.” To download the Lead and 
Copper Report and Consumer Notice of Lead Result Certificate in Microsoft Word or 
PDF format, visit www.michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community 
Water Supply, and Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). 

Annual Reports : These reports are due to this office each year. 

• The Cross Connection Report, due by March 31 , describes the status of your 
local cross connection control program. Manufactured housing communities are 
exempt from this requirements until 2016. 

Each year, water supplies must submit this report, even if a formal program has 
not been implemented. If cross connections do not exist in your water system, 
indicate so on the report. Download the Cross Connection Report form from 
http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). Instructions are 
included with the form. 

• The Annual Pumpage/Usage Report, due by March 31 , is required of water 
supplies that do not submit monthly operation reports. 

This summary of water pumpage and water use must be submitted by each 
water supply that does not submit a monthly operation report. To manage our 
natural resources, pumpage data are compiled to determine water use demands 
in Michigan. Download the Annua! Pumpage/Usage Report form from 
http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). Please be sure 
to indicate the appropriate units on the report (e g. million gallons or gallons). 

• The Consumer Confidence Report, due by July 1 to your customers, to your 
local health department and to this office, describes the quality of the water and 
characterizes the risks, if any, from exposure to contaminants detected.. 

Electronic delivery methods may be used to distribute the CCR to bill-paying 
customers, provided the method is direct. A paper copy must be delivered to bill- 
paying customers who request it or known to be unable to receive the CCR 
electronically. For more information on e-delivery, visit 
www.michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Consumer Confidence Report Rule (under Laws and Rules).

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The sampling protocol was revised to address comments received on October 22 
from EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force. 

• Staff assisted DLARA in conducting a plumbing assessment at Freeman 
Elementary School. Actions were taken to prepare for sampling to be conducted 
on Saturday, October 24. 

• The information requested by the DEQ was not received on October 23 from 
Flint’s consultant, Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN); thus, the 
construction permit for phosphate equipment was not issued. DEQ staff 
discussed with Flint Water Treatment Plant operator Brent Wright and Utilities 
Superintendent Michael Glascow. Brent confirmed that he needs to provide 
some of the information regarding the phosphate product to LAN. 

• DEQ staff discussed with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright the need for 
quarterly test runs and monthly operation reporting details while the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant is in standby mode. Also included the need to report phosphate 
dosages and phosphate residuals (plant tap and distribution) in the monthly 
operation report. 

• John O’Brien (Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office) contacted DEQ 
staff in response to our October 22 e-mail. The Lapeer County Road 
Commission (LCRC) has placed a stop work order on Contract S-4005; however, 
the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office contends that the LCRC has 
no authority to issue a stop work order; thus, work is continuing. DEQ stressed 
the importance to John of the need to keep the project moving forward and to 
confirm that the contractor is following proper soil erosion measures and other 
local guidelines that may apply. 

• Based on a discussion with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright, there have not 
been major distribution system issues or upsets since the switch back to Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department. Utility operators were flushing and winterizing 
hydrants this week and flushing from the Flint Water Treatment Plant to the 
outside reaches of the distribution system. Phosphate residuals are also being 
measured twice per week at Flint’s bacteria monitoring sites. 

Additional Actions: 

• Representatives from DEQ, DLARA, and DHFIS met on October 23 with Mayor 
Dayne Walling and Howard Croft from the city of Flint for the weekly update. 

Each group gave an overview of actions that were taken over the course of the 
week. The DEQ discussed sample results from homeowners since the offer to 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


provide free lead and copper testing was made. The DEQ also discussed the 
school sampling protocol that was developed and would be used on Saturday, 
October 24, at Freeman Elementary School. DLARA discussed the plumbing 
assessment of Freeman Elementary School that was being conducted on Friday, 
October 23. DHHS gave an update on the prioritization schema for blood lead 
screening that was being conducted for Flint residents, with the highest priority 
going to individuals with the highest risk, including young children and infants. 


• After the weekly coordination meeting, the city of Flint gave a tour of the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant to coordination committee members from the DEQ, 
DLARA, and DHHS. The tour provided a complete picture of the treatment 
process for both sources of water that could potentially be used, including water 
from the Flint River and treated water coming from Detroit. There was also 
discussion on how water from the Karegnondi Water Authority would be 
distributed, along with discussion of the supplemental addition of corrosion 
control agents. 


• On Saturday, October 24, representatives of DEQ and DLARA conducted the 
first sampling event of Flint schools at Freeman Elementary School. Media from 
several news agencies were present to cover the initial sampling event and 
conducted interviews with Karen Tommasulo and footage was taken of the 
sampling process. The sampling team consisted of seven members, and it took 
a little over three hours to conduct the entire sampling event. There was a small 
group of protesters outside of the school who stayed there for approximately an 
hour and a half, after which they peacefully disbursed. 

After the sampling event, the samples were driven to the DEQ Laboratory and 
logged into the computer system. The Laboratory’s Inorganics Unit Supervisor 
was contacted and made aware of the status of the samples. The samples were 
then prepped on Sunday, October 25, and are scheduled for analysis on 
Monday, October 26.

FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• A meeting has been confirmed for October 27 with DHHS to discuss all lead 
education material for schools. 

• DEQ staff discussed with the city of Flint’s consultant, Lockwood, Andrews & 
Newnam, Inc., the remaining items that are needed for issuance of Michigan’s 
Safe Drinking Water Act (Act 399) construction permit. Staff anticipates receiving 
these items on October 27. 

• DEQ staff obtained approximately 10,895 records from the city of Flint’s GIS 
system regarding service line index cards and extracted them into a table format 
for additional data review. Data review has been initiated by DEQ’s Lansing 
District Office staff. 

• DLARA and DEQ staff tentatively plans to conduct plumbing assessments at 
Brownell K-2 STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on 
October 30. DLARA staff will contact the Flint Community Schools’ facility 
administrator to confirm the date and approximate times. 

Additional Actions: 

• All of the 1 24 samples that were taken at Freeman Elementary School on 
Saturday, October 24, were analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory on Monday, 
October 26. The data is being compiled into a spreadsheet to allow an 
evaluation of the various sampling points. Initial indications are that there will 
need to be some replacement of plumbing fixtures, but issues do not seem to 
exist deeper into the plumbing infrastructure. Further sequential testing will be 
conducted at select points to verify that water is being drawn from the main. 

• DEQ staff met to discuss lessons learned from the sampling event at Freeman 
Elementary School. A number of observations were made with respect to how to 
streamline the process. The group agreed to incorporate several of the 
observations into the sampling protocol. The protocol is being updated to reflect 
these changes.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff on October 27 to discuss all lead education 
material for schools, and action items were created. 

• On October 27 DEQ’s Lansing District Office received updated dosage, pump 
specifications, and cut-sheets for phosphate product. A quick glance at the 
submittal shows most of the requested information has been provided, except for 
the NSF Standard 60 certification and the maximum dose. Staff will cross- 
reference the NSF Web site to verify proper certification and maximum dose. If 
acceptable, DEQ staff will proceed with issuance of the Act 399 permit. 
Otherwise, the city of Flint’s consultant will need to provide the DEQ with the 
NSF Standard 60 certification and maximum dose information. 

• DEQ staff has cross-referenced 46 of the 326 historical lead and copper 
monitoring sampling sites with the 10,895 service line index card information 
records available to date. 

• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff to review and further develop childcare facility 
guidance and incorporate drinking water exposure information. Guidance is 
being provided by DHHS specific to the Genesee County emergency order, and 
separate guidance for statewide use will also be developed. 

Additional Actions: 

• Preliminary follow-up review of sampling event at Freeman Elementary School: 
DEQ and DLARA staff met and reviewed outlet/tap materials to correlate with 
sample results. DEQ staff contacted Jim Henry, Genesee County Health 
Department, to confirm the location of screening samples. The draft write-up is 
to be completed by DEQ staff on October 28. 

• The weekly meeting between DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS was held. Discussion 
topics included a review of the results for Freeman Elementary School, along 
with a discussion of what the results meant and how the data would be presented 
to the Flint Community Schools Superintendent so that the information could be 
used to create an action plan for the school. Discussion also included working 
out the logistics for conducting the plumbing evaluation and subsequent sampling 
for the other two elementary schools that had results above the action level 
during the initial screen of 13 schools. Plans are in process to conduct these two 
plumbing evaluations on Friday, October 30, with the sampling to take place on 
Saturday, October 31 .

• Discussion held on October 28 with EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force 
(Task Force) concerning monitoring results at Freeman Elementary School. A 
report that summarizes the results of the samples collected from the school for 
the lead analysis has been drafted. 

• DEQ staff discussed the items needed for the corrosion control treatment plan. 
An outline of a Corrosion Treatment Operation letter has been prepared. The 
letter will be finalized and sent to the city of Flint. Water quality parameter 
monitoring and laboratory certification was also discussed with the EPA’s Task 
Force. 

• DEQ staff completed the review and verified NSF Standard 60 conformance, 
proper dosage, and feed pump sizing. The Act 399 permit for the installation of 
the phosphate feed equipment was issued on October 28. 

• Coordinated with the DEQ Laboratory to create and produce the “Request for 
Water Analysis Forms” and the bottle order needed for sampling at Brownell K-2 
STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on Saturday, October 31 . 

Additional Action: 

DEQ Director Dan Wyant and DEQ staff met with DHHS Director Nick Lyon and DHHS 
staff to discuss coordination of the messaging of data related to Flint water and blood 
samples. It was agreed that it was important to ensure that the water and blood data 
are put into context with respect to each other. Discussion also involved creating a 
message that discusses what lead concentrations in water mean from a regulatory and 
from a health-based perspective. Current regulations are not in step with current 
health-based exposure models, so additional work needs to be done to ensure a 
comprehensive message that is clear.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Weekly internal After Action Plan meetings are being held. The topics of 
discussion for the meeting held on October 29 included a status update of the 
time line of events. It was agreed that a long-term comprehensive time line 
needed to be created, but an outline written at a higher level was needed within 
the next week to present to the Governor’s After Action Review Panel. Additional 
discussion topics included an internal evaluation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended, as well as the federal lead and copper rule to 
determine what, if any, actions were implemented incorrectly. 

• Negotiations between the Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) and the 
DEQ have begun to set up a contract to utilize GCHD resources to conduct 
sampling of schools within the Flint Community Schools as well as parochial 
schools, charter schools, and childcare facilities. 

• The final draft of the school sampling protocol has been written and is awaiting 
final review. This version of the protocol incorporates comments by the EPA and 
will be used to sample at Eisenhower Elementary School and Brownell K-2 
STEM Academy on Saturday October 31 . Experiences from the sampling of 
Freeman Elementary School on Saturday October 24, were used to create the 
final draft, and experiences from Eisenhower and Brownell will be used to 
determine if any further changes are required.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Comments on the corrosion control treatment plan received late in the day on 
October 30 from EPA were addressed, and the letter to the city of Flint regarding 
operational and monitoring conditions related to corrosion control was finalized. 

A PDF of the letter was e-mailed on October 30 to the city of Flint et at. 

• Staff from DLARA and DEQ conducted plumbing assessments at both Brownell 
and Eisenhower Elementary Schools on October 30. Sampling taps were 
identified and labeled. Based on the plumbing assessment, a sampling 
sequence was recommended for each school. 

Additional Actions: 

• DEQ Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian and DEQ Public Information 
Officer Karen Tommasulo met with representatives of DLARA, DHHS, and city of 
Flint officials, including Mayor Dayne Walling, to discuss progress made since 
the last meeting and to discuss actions to come in the week of November 2. 
Topics included the issuance of a construction permit that would enable the city 
of Flint to provide supplemental phosphate addition to the water coming from 
Detroit. A high level summary regarding the progress of the testing for lead in 
drinking water in the Flint schools was provided with a subsequent discussion by 
the group as a whole. Mayor Walling inquired as to how remediation of the 
schools would be funded, and he was informed that funding was outside the 
purview of the initial assessment. 

• Staff from DEQ and DLARA conducted water sampling at Brownell K-2 STEM 
Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on Saturday, October 31 . In 
addition, staff went back to Freeman Elementary School to pull sequential 
samples as per comments from EPA regarding DEQ’s sampling protocol. The 
sequential samples were also taken at Brownell and Eisenhower. Complete 
sampling protocols have now been conducted at three Flint schools. There were 
a total of 374 samples taken at the three schools on October 31 . 

• As provided by DHHS, the purchased total water filter/pitcher distribution for the 
period of October 6 through October 29 is 9,880 units.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

• The city of Flint has received the necessary building permits to move forward 
with plans for the supplemental addition of phosphate to water that is coming 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. The purpose of the 
supplemental addition of phosphate is to reestablish the protective coating 
throughout the distribution system. This protective coating slows the leaching 
process of lead from service lines, household fixtures, and solder used for 
connecting copper pipes. The city of Flint has made the purchase of the 
necessary equipment a high priority and hopes to have the pumps installed and 
running within the next month. 

• The report for Freeman Elementary School that documents and explains the 
results of the plumbing evaluation conducted by the DEQ and DLARA has been 
completed and will be distributed on November 9. The report demonstrates that 
the issues in the school are fixture-specific and that there was no evidence found 
to suggest that significant lead contamination is occurring deep within the 
plumbing system. The report will recommend replacement of fixtures that were 
found to have lead levels exceeding 15 parts per billion. Once a press release 
has been issued, the report will be posted to the Flint water Web site: 

www. m i . q o v/f I i ntwate r . 

• Data for residents of the city of Flint have been compiled into spreadsheets that 
sort the data by ZIP Code and also by concentration. The data to date indicate 
that the issue of lead contamination is not system-wide but is site specific. Over 
three quarters of the samples showed lead levels of 5 parts per billion or less and 
over 91 percent of the samples were at levels of 15 parts per billion or less. 

These spreadsheets will also be posted to the Flint water Web site. 

Positions : 

• With respect to the school data and the samples submitted by residents through 
the free lead testing program, the issue of lead contamination in the water 
appears to be site specific. In both cases, the water within the distribution 
system does not appear to be the issue. The contamination appears to be 
coming from fixtures, solder used to connect copper, and from lead service lines. 
While the initial results are encouraging and show that the large majority of 
homes do not have an issue, it is important that residents do not make 
assumptions. The only way to know if water contains lead is to have it tested. 

Concerns : 

• The action level of 1 5 parts per billion that is used in the lead and copper rule 
(LCR) was set up to determine if a supply was utilizing optimized corrosion 
controls. It was not meant to serve as a health-based exposure model. The 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


DEQ will be releasing data on Freeman Elementary School and residential data 
on November 9. The DHHS is currently working on evaluating blood lead levels 
on children in the city of Flint. It is important that when the DHHS is ready to 
present their data that the message they present does not inadvertently 
contradict information provided by the DEQ. While it is recognized that the 
ultimate goal is to have no detectable amount of lead in the water, this goal may 
not be practical as the DEQ utilizes the criteria as specified by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

• The State of Michigan is being criticized as a result of recent information coming 
to light that a significant number of samples were not collected from proper 
sampling locations as part of the sampling program in the city of Flint to 
demonstrate compliance with the LCR under Michigan’s Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1 976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399). Recently the city of Flint began to 
electronically convert customer service line information. This effort, along with 
statements by some of the city of Flint’s certified operators, directly conflicts with 
information certified by the city of Flint in documents referred to as LCR 
compliance monitoring certification reports. 

• Correspondence is drafted and will be sent to the city of Flint requesting that they 
provide appropriate documentation to demonstrate that the sampling locations 
selected and certified by the city of Flint comply with Act 399. In the absence of 
appropriate justification/documentation, the city of Flint may be subject to 
enforcement for violation of Act 399. 

Significant Event : 

• On November 3 the EPA issued a memorandum to address “certain concerns 
raised about the application of the [federal] 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, 
specifically the requirements pertaining to maintenance of optimal corrosion 
control treatment, in situations in which a large water system ceases to purchase 
treated water and switches to a new drinking water source.” This EPA 
memorandum further states: “This type of situation rarely arises and the 
language of the LCR does not specifically discuss such circumstances. After 
reviewing the rule with our Office of General Counsel, it appears that there are 
differing possible interpretations of the LCR with respect to how the rule’s optimal 
corrosion control treatment procedures apply to this situation....” This EPA 
memorandum clarifies the requirements should a situation like Flint occur again 
in the future. However, it clearly recognizes that the options chosen by Michigan 
were one interpretation or option of the LCR. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• Staff e-mailed Michael Glasgow and Brent Wright of the city of Flint on 
November 4 to request a time line and a request to notify the DEQ when the 
phosphate equipment is installed. Mr. Wright responded on November 5 noting 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 3 


that the city of Flint just received the Act 399 permit in the mail on November 5. 
Equipment is to be ordered by November 6, and the Flint Water Treatment Plant 
operators plan to start installing the feed piping on November 9. 

• A letter detailing standby operation requirements is currently being prepared by 
the DEQ and will be sent to the city of Flint during the week of November 9. A 
review of the standby operation monthly operation reports with the city of Flint will 
be conducted during the next routine site visit at the Flint Water Treatment Plant. 

• A letter has been prepared that requests the city of Flint to provide additional 
information and documentation regarding all of their historic LCR compliance 
sampling sites and to compare the service line information reported on the LCR 
compliance monitoring certification reports against the service line information 
from the city of Flint’s digitized index cards. Conflicts noted between the index 
cards and the LCR compliance monitoring certification will need further 
explanation, and the city of Flint will need to provide supporting documentation 
demonstrating these sites meet Tier 1 criteria. The letter will be provided to the 
city of Flint on November 9. 

• The draft document for sampling protocol for residential exposure assessment is 
under development. DEQ staff discussed the preliminary plan with DHHS staff. 

• The draft document for generic school sampling guidance for statewide 
distribution is under development. Staff is working on making this an easy-to- 
read and follow guidance document. 

• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff on November 5 to discuss residential elevated 
blood lead investigations and a protocol for water testing. 

Other Items : 

• As provided by the DHHS, the purchased total water filter/pitcher distribution 
through November 6 is 13,649 units. 

• Attached are the: 

o Final report for the plumbing evaluation of Freeman Elementary School 

o Spreadsheets that consolidate the lead and copper data for Freeman 

Elementary School

On Friday, October 23, 2015, the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (DLARA) and the Department 
of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducted an assessment of Freeman Elementary School's plumbing system 
to gain a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing 
materials are used. The assessment identified the following potential sources of lead leaching into drinking water: 

• Lead solder joints on copper piping 

* Brass valves and brass fittings 

• Brass components in fixtures 

* Galvanized piping 


The assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains that provide water for drinking, cooking, and/or food 
preparation. The team developed a sequence for samplingthe 31 faucets/fountains based on how the water travels 
through the building. 

On Saturday, October 24, 2015, the DEQ and the DLARA completed sampling of the 31 faucets/fountains, in 
the order determined by the plumbing assessment from the previous day, following a stagnation period of 12 
hours. At each of the 31 faucets/fountains identified, staff collected four samples. Two initial, 125-milliliter 
samples (PI and P2) were collected immediately after turning on the tap. The water was then flushed for 30 
seconds, and a third 125-milliliter sample (FI) was collected. Finally, the water was flushed for another two 
minutes, and the fourth 125-milliliter sample (F2) was collected. These samples were used to determine the 
impact of any lead sources in and around each specific faucet/fountain and its connecting plumbing. 

On Saturday, October 31, 2015, the DEQ completed consecutive sampling at three of the 31 faucets/fountains 
following a stagnation period of 12 hours. This sampling was used to determine the impact of any lead sources 
located deep in the supply plumbing. The three sites included one site near the building service line, one site 
near the plumbing mid-point, and one site at the far end of the plumbing system. At each of these three sites, 
staff collected 10, 1-liter samples. The 10 samples were collected immediately after turning on the tap, and 
consecutively, without any flushing time in between. 






A four-inch diameter cast iron water service line enters the school in the boiler room on the west wall. Piping 
in the boiler room immediately transitions into galvanized metal piping for cold water lines. Two separate 
galvanized cold water supply lines exit the boiler room. One in the northeast corner appears to serve the gym, 
auditorium, and proposed pre-K facilities on the north end of the school. The other exits the boiler room in the 
southwest comer and appears to serve the remainder of the school to the south, including the library. This line 
was also found to have grounding connections attached to the piping. Hot water is distributed in continuous 
loops that, feed from and return to a central water heater in the boiler room. Hot water piping material, where 
exposed, was copper piping with 50/50 lead solder joints. Brass valves were seen throughout the building.

The DEQ recommends school facilities take action if samples from any drinking water outlets show lead levels 
greater than 15 parts per billion. Based on the sampling conducted at 31 faucets/fountains on October 24, 
2015, the following nine drinking water outlets had lead water level results greater than 15 parts per billion. 
Each of these nine outlets is listed below with its sample results, including a description of the potential 
source(s) of lead, and recommended actions for the school to take. 


Outlet: Bubbler Drinking Fountain, Left(DWOOl) 

Location: Haliway outside Janitorial Room 
Results: P1=4Q parts per billion, P2=6 parts per billion 

Fl=4 parts per billion, F2=l part per billion 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the 
bubbler itself. This bubbler fixture is believed to have a brass vaive. 

The connection underneath the sink also appears to have some brass 
components, including the valve at the wall. 

Replacement of this bubbler tap and its connection plumbing with lead- 
free materials will significantly reduce lead exposure at this location, 
if replacement is not currently feasible, sample results indicate that flushing this tap for 3 minutes following 
periods of stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations and lead exposure. 



Outlet: Sink Faucet (CF029) 

Location: DHHS Office, west wall 
Results: Pl=17 parts per billion, P2=12 parts per billion 

Fl=2 parts per billion, F2=non-detect 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the 
faucet, and its connecting plumbing. Thefaucet is a Delta 400. This model 
faucet valve has brass components. This style faucet also has a mixing 
valve that may allow mixing of hot and cold vvater. Connecting plumbing 
in the cabinet under the sink may also contain brass components. 

This faucet, also has an aerator at the outlet. The aerator should be removed, inspected for particulate 
accumulations, scrubbed clean, and reinstalled. If particulates are found, the aerator should be periodically 
checked and cleaned. 

Replacement of this faucet and its connection plumbing with lead-free materials will significantly reduce lead 
exposure at this location. If replacement is not currently feasible, sample results indicate that flushing this tap 
for 3 minutes following periods of stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations and lead exposure. 



2 


Outlet: Integrated faucet and bubbler fountain (CF008) 


Location: Classroom 2, south wall 
Results; Pl=16 parts per billion, P2=3 parts per billion 
Fl=l part per billion, F2=l part per billion 

These results were collected from the faucet portion of the fixture and 
suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the fixture itself. 
The make and model of this fixture is unknown, but appears to be made 
of chrome plated brass and may be connected on the underside of the 
sink using a brass nipple. 



Replacement of this fixture and its connection plumbing with lead-free 

materiaiswiil significantly reduce iead exposure atthis location, if replacement is not currently feasible, sample results 
indicate that flushing this tap for 3 minutes following periods of stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations 
and lead exposure. 


Outlet: Integrated faucet and bubbler fountain (CF014) 

Location: Classroom 10, north wail 
Results: Pl=27 parts per billion, P2=7 parts per billion 

Fl=4 parts per billion, F2=3 parts per billion 

These results were collected from the faucet portion of the fixture and 
suggest the highest contribution of iead may be from the fixture itself and 
its connecting plumbing. The make and model of this fixture is unknown, 
but appears to be made of chrome plated brass and may be connected 
on the underside of the sink using a brass nipple. Connecting plumbing 
in the cabinet under the sink may also contain brass components. 

Replacement of this fixture and its connection plumbing with lead-free materials will significantly reduce iead 
exposure atthis location. If replacement is not currently feasible, sample results indicate that flushing this tap 
for 3 minutes following periods of stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations and lead exposure. 



3 


Outlet: Sink Faucet (CF013) 

Location: Classroom 10, north wall 
Results; P±=9 parts per billion, P2=18 parts per billion 
Fl=3 parts per billion, F2=3 parts per billion 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the 
connecting plumbing with some contribution from the faucet itself. The 
faucet appears to be a Delta 500 series. This model faucet may have 
some brass components. This style faucet also has a mixing vaive that 
may allow mixing of hot and cold water. Connecting plumbing in the 
cabinet under the sink should be checked for brass components, including brass valves. 

This faucet also has an aerator at the outlet. The aerator should be removed, inspected for particulate 
accumulations, scrubbed clean, and reinstalled. If particulates are found, the aerator should be periodically 
checked and cleaned. 

Replacement of this faucet, and its connection plumbing with lead-free materials will significantly reduce lead 
exposure at this location, if replacement is not currently feasible, sample results indicate that flushing this tap 
for 3 minutes following periods of stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations and lead exposure. 



Outlet: Sink Faucet (CFG15} 

Location: Classroom .1.1, northeast corner 
Results: Pi=102 parts per billion, P2=326 parts per billion 

FI =14 parts per billion, F2=ll parts per billion 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the 
connecting plumbing and from the faucet itself. The faucet is an older 
design that uses a brass tube approximately 8 inches in length between 
the hot and cold water valves and connects to the outlet under the sink. 

This brass tube may be the primary source of lead, explaining the higher 
second (P2) sample result. The faucet and valves may also contain brass 
components. Connecting plumbing in the cabinet under the sink should 
be checked for additional brass components, including brass valves. 

This faucet also has an aerator at the outlet. The aerator should be removed, inspected for particulate 
accumulations, scrubbed clean, and reinstalled. If particulates are found, the aerator should be periodically 
checked and cleaned. 

Replacement, of this faucet, and its connection plumbing with iead-free materials wiil significantly reduce iead 
exposure at this location and needs to be completed, if replacement is not currently feasible, DO NOT USETHiS 
FAUCET FOR DRINKING OR COOKING. 




Location: Classroom 19, east wall 
Results; Pl=23 parts per billion, P2=3 parts per billion 
Fl=4 part per billion, F2=3 parts per billion 

These results were collected from the faucet portion of the fixture and 
suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the fixture itself. 
The make and model of this fixture is unknown, but appears to be made 
of chrome plated brass and may be connected on the underside of the 
sink using a brass nipple. 


Replacement of this fixture and its connection plumbing with lead- 

free materials will significantly reduce lead exposure at this location. If replacement is not currently feasible, 
sample results indicate that flushing this tap for 3 minutes following periods of stagnation Is likely to reduce 
lead concentrations and lead exposure. 


Location: Classroom 14, west wall 
Results: Pl=36 parts per billion, P2=30 parts per billion 

Fl=17 parts per billion, F2=4 parts per billion 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from 
the bubbler itself. This bubbler fixture appears to be made of chrome 
plated brass. This style bubbler typically has a 4-5-inch brass fitting 
that connects to a 3-inch brass nipple on the underside of the sink. 
This would explain the higher concentrations in the first two sample 
results. The connection underneath the sink may also have some brass 
components and should be checked, including the valve. 



Replacement of this bubbler tap and its connection plumbing with lead-free materials will significantly reduce 
lead exposure at this location and should be completed. If replacement is not currently feasible, sample results 
indicate that flushing this tap for 3 minutes prior to each use and for at least 4 minutes following periods of 
stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations and lead exposure, in general, use of this fountain for drinking 
water should be discouraged. 




Outlet: Bubbler fountain (CF031) 

Location: Proposed Pre-K Room, south wall 
Results; Pl=57 parts per billion, P2=3 parts per billion 
Fl=2 parts per billion, F2=non-detect 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the 
bubbler itself. This bubbler fixture appears to be made of chrome plated 
brass. This bubbler has a brass fitting connection to a brass nipple. The 
connector hose is not expected to be contributing lead. 



Replacement of this bubbler tap and its connection plumbing with lead- 

free materials wiS! significantly reduce lead exposure at this location and should be completed, if replacement, 
is not currently feasible, sample results indicate that flushing this tap for 3 minutes following periods of 
stagnation is likely to reduce lead concentrations and lead exposure.

While the remaining 22 outlets showed sample results to be at levels requiring no further action, several 
recommendations have been identified. 

The fourth sample at each of these 2.2 outlets following approximately 3 minutes of use and flushing at a 
reduced flow reduced lead concentrations to 4 parts per billion or less. This indicates that flushing of all taps 
used for drinking, cooking, and/or food preparation for 4 minutes following periods of stagnation will further 
reduce lead exposure. It is recommended that a flushing operational procedure be developed for use by staff 
responsible for plumbing operations and maintenance. 

Twelve of these outlets are comprised of similar materials as the outlets listed above and could potentially 
experience higher lead levels under extended periods of stagnation. These faucets/fountains include: 

» Sink Side Bubbler Units in Classroom 12(CF022), Classroom 5 (CF0G9), Classroom 21(CFG28), Hallway 
Fountain (DW002), Classroom 15 (CF018), Classroom 17 (CF020), and Classroom 1 (DW005). 

* Integrated Faucet. Bubbler Fountain Units in Classroom 6 (CF010), Classroom 9 (CF012), Classroom 4 
(CF008), Classroom 3 (CF007), and Classroom 7 (CFOll). 

Replacement, of these fixtures with lead-free materials is also recommended. 

The remaining .1.0 outlets showed sample results of 15 parts per billion or less, requiring no further action or 
additional recommendations. These faucets/fountains include: 

« Sink Faucets in Classroom 1 (CF004), Classroom 15 (CF017), Classroom 17 (CF019), Classroom 12 
(CF021), Classroom 19 (CF023), Classroom .1.4 (CF025), Classroom 21 (CF027), and Proposed Pre-K 
Room (CF030). 

• Kitchen Sink (cold) in the Community Room (KC003). 

» Sink Side Bubbler Fountain in Classroom 11 (CF016).

The consecutive samples taken at three sites in the building on October 31, 2015, provide additional 
confirmation that the highest contribution of lead appears to be from the individual faucet/fountains and not 
from the larger diameter supply plumbing within the school building.

The continued presence of lead in samples collected at Classroom 11 (CF015) may be a result of lead 
particulates caught in the aerator/screen installed on the faucet outlet or may be from a source of lead 
further back in the plumbing system. However, the non-detect results from consecutive samples collected in 
Proposed Pre-K Room (CF030) and Classroom 21 (CF027) suggest any additional source of lead associated 
with Classroom 11 (CF015) is localized to the plumbing branch serving this faucet. The faucet aerator/screen 
in Classroom 11 (CF015) should be removed and inspected before completing a more in-depth plumbing 
analysis. Consecutive sampling results at Classroom 11 (CF015) support the water use restrictions specified 
for this outlet

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

• The Flint Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meeting was held on November 9. 
The meeting included representatives from the EPA, DEQ, DHHS, and city of Flint, 
as well as other interested parties. Representatives from the city of Flint indicated 
that they were modifying the sampling protocol instructions to remove a reference 
to pre-flushing of service lines just prior to the beginning of the stagnation period 
for samples being utilized for compliance with the lead and copper rule. An update 
was given regarding a water plan that outlines short-term, intermediate term, and 
long-term goals that the city of Flint is working on in order to get switched over to 
the Karegnondi Water Authority. DEQ staff discussed corrosion control dosages 
and monitoring requirements in detail with the city of Flint and its consultants. 
Representatives from EPA reiterated the need for higher dosages of phosphate in 
order to expedite the formation of a protective layer in the city of Flint’s water 
distribution system. This would be a supplemental addition of phosphate to the 
water coming from Detroit that only contains what is considered to be a 
maintenance dose. 

• The samples for Brownell K-2 STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary 
School were analyzed and the data consolidated into spreadsheets. The results 
for both schools parallel the results found at Freeman Elementary School, in that 
the issues appear to be primarily located at the fixture. The percentage of 
locations needing corrective action appears to be greater than what was found at 
Freeman. Work has begun on putting together reports that provide 
recommendations for addressing the issues that were found. Once the reports 
have been completed, they will be shared with the Flint Community Schools 
Superintendent, and then the reports will be published to the Flint water Web 

• The water samples for Doyle/Ryder Elementary School and Pierce Elementary 
School have been analyzed. The results for these schools are currently being 
compiled and evaluated. 

Positions : 

• There are no new positions to report since last week. 

Concerns : 

• A Notice of Intent to Sue has been received from the Natural Resources Defense 
Council and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan. The subject reads: 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


Notice of Intent to Sue Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 

42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(b)(1)(a), for Failure to Control Lead in 
Drinking Water in Flint, Michigan, and Failure to Assist 
Michigan Schools with Lead Testing and Remediation 

• A letter was sent by the DEQ on November 9 requesting the city of Flint to 
provide additional information and documentation concerning discrepancies 
between the water service line material reported in the lead/copper reporting 
forms and the water service line material reported in digitized water service index 
cards. The city of Flint must also complete the correlation for all of the remaining 
lead/copper sampling locations that were used since the start of monitoring under 
the lead and copper rule in 1992. Any additional further discrepancies must be 
explained. The city must complete this task by December 30. The existence of 
these discrepancies has been made public by the media. 

Significant Events : 

• A Frequently Asked Questions document has been prepared to address key 
events and decisions surrounding the Flint water situation. This document is 
being presented to the Governor’s Flint Water Task Force to assist in providing 
key information to the investigation. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant was interviewed by Rochelle Riley, Detroit Free Press, 
on November 10. Topics of discussion included the results from Freeman 
Elementary School and short-term, intermediate term, and long-term plans to 
address issues with Flint’s water supply, as well as a discussion of corrosion 
controls and how they will be implemented moving forward. 

• DEQ Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian was interviewed by NBC 
News 25 on November 1 1 . The main topic of conversation was the results from 
Freeman Elementary School. The main point was that the results clearly 
indicated that the issues at the school were fixture-specific and were not deep 
within the plumbing infrastructure. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• A meeting is scheduled for November 20 among DEQ staff to discuss draft 
legislative changes to Part 54 of the Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection Act, 1994 PA 451 , as amended. 

• The draft time line was shared with the Governor’s Flint Water Task Force on 
November 1 3.

• DEQ staff discussed corrosion control dosages and monitoring requirements in 
more detail with the city of Flint and their consultant during the November 9 Flint 
TAC meeting. Orthophosphate dosage concerns brought to the table by the city 
of Flint’s consultant were addressed by DEQ and EPA staff. 

• DEQ staff followed up with the city of Flint during the November 9 TAC meeting 
regarding installation of corrosion control and confirmed that the chemical feed 
pumps have been ordered and delivery is approximately two weeks out. The 
Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) operators are currently installing the feed 
system piping and water booster pumps. The city of Flint anticipates having the 
corrosion control feed system installed and ready for operation by the end of 
November. 

• DEQ staff has drafted a letter that establishes standby operation (test run) 
requirements for the Flint WTP, based upon the city’s previous test run Monthly 
Operation Reports. The draft letter also discusses the potential for Flint to obtain 
a limited supply of raw water directly to the Flint WTP from the Karegnondi Water 
Authority prior to spring 2016 for treatment evaluation. The draft letter will be 
finalized and sent to the city of Flint the week of November 16. 

• DEQ staff discussed with Genesee County during the November 9 TAC meeting 
the most recent stop work orders issued by the Lapeer County Road 
Commission (LCRC). Genesee County is continuing to install the pipeline and is 
working with the LCRC to correct the soil erosion control issues. Genesee 
County has not expressed a concern of this delaying their construction schedule. 

• The DEQ sent a letter to the city of Flint on November 9. The letter requests the 
city of Flint to provide additional information/documentation concerning 
discrepancies between the water service line material reported in the lead/copper 
reporting forms and the water service line material reported in digitized water 
service index cards. The city of Flint must also complete the correlation for all of 
the remaining lead/copper sampling locations that were used since the start of 
monitoring under the lead and copper rule in 1992. Any additional further 
discrepancies must be explained. The city of Flint must complete this task by 
December 30. 

• The draft sampling protocol was shared with DHHS on November 10. 

• DEQ staff, Jim Sygo and Michael Prysby, attended the November 9 Flint TAC 
meeting as described above. Chief Deputy Director Sygo also presented DEQ’s 
findings of the results of the lead sampling conducted at Freeman Elementary 
School.

• DEQ and DLARA staff completed plumbing assessments at Durant-Tuuri-Mott 
Elementary School and the central kitchen on November 13. 

• DEQ staff conducted water sampling at Durant-Tuuri-Mott Elementary School 
and the central kitchen on November 14. 

Other Items : 

• As provided by the DHHS, the purchased total water filter/pitcher distribution 
through November 13 is approximately 14,000 units. 

• Attached are the draft spreadsheets that consolidate the lead data for Brownell 
K-2 STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

• An 1 8-Point Partnering Plan was developed to guide DEQ staff on the Flint water 
issue. The document focuses on areas of concern and identifies key 
partnerships. The issues in the Partnering Plan address short-term, intermediate 
term, and long-terms goals. This document will be reviewed at least weekly, and 
actions by DEQ staff with respect to the Partnering Plan will be documented. 

The Partnering Plan has become a standing agenda item and a central focus for 
the internal action plan meetings. 

• On November 20 the weekly meeting was held at Flint between DEQ staff and 
city of Flint officials. Mayor Karen Weaver was present at the meeting. This was 
Mayor Weaver’s first time in attendance at the weekly meeting. After 
introductions were made, Mayor Weaver was given an overview of the data from 
the free homeowner’s testing. Mayor Weaver was informed that the samples 
were from any Flint resident who wished to have their water tested and, as such, 
were not necessarily representative of the site selection criteria as specified in 
the lead and copper rule, but with that said, the results were encouraging. Mayor 
Weaver was informed that over 3/4 of the samples had results of 5 parts per 
billion (ppb) or less and that approximately 92 percent of the sample results were 
at 15 ppb or less. It was also stressed to Mayor Weaver that, although the 
results were encouraging, there were also pockets of concern where the lead 
levels in the drinking water were significantly above 15 ppb. 

There was also discussion about making sure that water sample results were 
kept in context. In order for an individual to be sure with respect to their 
exposure to lead, they should have their blood tested. Individuals with an 
elevated blood level (EBL) would then be encouraged to have an EBL 
investigation done to evaluate all potential exposure pathways. There was then 
discussion as to what the EBL investigation entailed and how the water testing 
was being incorporated into the EBL. 

The meeting ended with an invitation by the DEQ to Mayor Weaver to come tour 
the DEQ’s Laboratory to see first-hand how samples were analyzed. Mayor 
Weaver indicated that she would be very interested in a tour and that a date 
would be set up. 

Positions : 

• There are no new positions to report since last week. 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update

Concerns : 

• There are no new concerns to report since last week. 

Significant Events : 

• A Frequently Asked Questions document was provided to the Governor’s Flint 
Water Task Force (Task Force) on November 1 6. DEQ staff subsequently met 
with the Task Force on November 18. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• DEQ staff provided comments on the final draft of the DHFIS protocol for EBL 
investigations. The sampling protocol will utilize 14 drinking water samples that 
will be used to identify potential sources of exposure to lead located in the 
plumbing system of residential dwellings. 

• DEQ staff provided comment on the draft sampling protocol that the city of Flint is 
proposing to use for compliance monitoring for the lead and copper rule. This 
document has been forwarded to staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) for additional comment. 

• On November 1 9 DEQ staff contacted EPA staff via e-mail regarding a request 
by the city of Flint for guidance on a corrosion control treatment evaluation for 
Karegnondi Water Authority source water use at the Flint Water Treatment Plant. 
A meeting has been scheduled for December 1 1 to discuss the issue with all 
parties. 

• DEQ and DLARA staff conducted a plumbing assessment of Neithercut 
Elementary School in Flint on November 20. 

• DEQ and DLARA staff conducted school sampling at Neithercut Elementary 
School in Flint on Saturday, November 21 . 

• A draft report for Eisenhower Elementary School was completed and is awaiting 
final publishing and will then be posted to the Flint water Web site: 

www. m i . gov/'fli n twater . 

• Draft reports for Brownell K-2 STEM Academy and Pierce Elementary Schools 
are in progress and near completion. 

• DEQ staff has been in meetings with the Office of the Auditor General audit team 
and have provided information and documentation as requested.

Significant Events : 

There are no significant events to report since last week. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• The Flint Drinking Water Events Timeline has been revised. The header and 
footer were updated, and acronyms were generally removed. Permit numbers 
have been deleted, and dates were filled in to the extent possible. The most 
significant change is the December 31 , 2014, item regarding end of the 1 st 
monitoring period. This was rewritten to be consistent with the June 30, 2015, 
end of the 2nd monitoring period item. The compliance letter reporting the 
results was added on March 30, 2015. 

• School sampling was suspended due to the holiday and is scheduled to continue 
on Saturday, December 5, 2015. 

• The report for Eisenhower Elementary School was completed, has gone through 
final publishing, and will be posted to the Flint water Web site: 

www. m L g ov/f I j ntwate r . 

• There are now a total of four schools in Flint that are not part of the Flint 
Community Schools that have requested plumbing assessments and sampling of 
their facilities. These facilities will be evaluated once the Flint school system 
evaluation has been completed. The four facilities include: Eagle’s Nest 
Academy, Powers Catholic High School, International Academy of Flint, and 

St. Paul Lutheran School. It is anticipated that these facilities will be evaluated 
beginning sometime in January 2016.

ng Assessment Recom mersdatioris 


v O W ? 









On Friday, October 30, 2015, the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (DLARA) and the Department 
of Environmental Quality (DE.Q) conducted an assessment of Eisenhower Elementary School's plumbing system 
to gain a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing 
materials are used. Two outlet buildings in addition to the main school building were included in the assessment. 
The assessment identified the following potential sources of lead leaching into drinking water: 

* Lead solder joints on copper piping 

® Brass valves and brass fittings 

« Brass components in fixtures 

* Galvanized piping 

The assessment also identified 43 faucets or fountains that provide water for drinking, cooking, and/or food 
preparation, 37 faucets/fountains in the main school building, four faucets/fountains in out building unit. 1, and 
two faucets/fountains in out building unit 2. The team developed a sequence for sampling the faucets/fountains in 
each building based on how the water travels through each building. 

On Saturday, October 31, 2015, the DEQ and the DLARA completed sampling of the 37 faucets/fountains in the 
main school building, the four faucets/fountains in out building unit 1, and the two faucets/fountains in out building 
unit 2, each in the order determined by the plumbing assessment from the previous day, following a stagnation 
period of over 12 hours. At each of the 43 faucets/fountains identified, staff collected four samples. Two initial, 
125-mililiter samples (PI and P2), were collected immediately after turning on the tap. The water was then flushed 
for 30 seconds and a third, 125-miiiliter sample (FOl) was collected. Finally, the water was flushed for another 
two minutes, and the fourth 125-mililiter sample (FG2) was collected. These samples were used to determine the 
impact of any lead sources in and around each specific faucet/fountain and its connecting plumbing. 

The DEQ and the DLARA then completed consecutive sampling at three of the 37 faucets/fountains in the main 
school building, one of the four faucets/fountains in out building unit. 1, and one of the two faucets/fountains in 
out building unit 2, five sites in total. This consecutive sampling was used to determine the impact of any lead 
sources located deep in the supply plumbing at each of these buildings. The three sites in the main school building 
included one site near the building service line, one site near the plumbing mid-point, and one site at the far end of 
the plumbing system. At each of these five sites, staff collected 10, 1-liter samples. The 10 samples were collected 
immediately after turning on the tap, and consecutively, without, any flushing time in between.

RVICE INFORMATION 


A four-inch diameter cast iron water service line enters the main school building in the boiler room northwest 
wall located in the west corner of the building. Piping in the boiler room immediately transitions into galvanized 
metal piping for cold water lines. Three separate galvanized cold water supply lines exit the boiler room. One 
in the north corner serves a single hose bib directly outside the boiler room. A second line exits the southeast 
wall and serves the adjacent janitors closet and dressing room bathrooms. The third line exits the boiler room 
on the northeast side through a utility tunnel that runs below the school hallways and serves all rooms In the 
main school building. This supply line then runs between the first and second floors on the southeast end of 


l 


the building. Copper piping with lead solder joints branches off of the galvanized supply Sine for cold water 
supply to each room. Hot water is distributed in continuous loops that feed from and return to a central water 
heater in the boiler room. Hot water piping material, where exposed, was copper piping with lead solder joints. 
Brass valves were seen throughout the building. 

Out building unit 1 has a separate customer service line from the City water main constructed using copper 
piping material. The service line comes out of the ground beneath the building and within the building is 
copper pipe with iead free solder joints. 

Out building unit 2 has a separate customer service line from the City water main constructed using copper 
piping material. The service line comes out of the ground beneath the building and within the building is 
copper pipe with iead free solder joints. 


WitH I 1 ft rf* tr* r ¥ li & si 1 B Billion 


The DEO recommends school facilities take action if samples from any drinking water outlets show lead levels 
greater than 15 parts per billion. Based on the sampling conducted at 43 faucets/fountains on October 31, 
2015, the following 18 drinking water outlets had lead water level results greater than 15 parts per billion. 
Each of these 18 outlets is listed below with its sample results, inciudinga description of the potential source(s) 
of lead, and recommended actions for the school to take. 


Outlet: Bubbler Drinking Fountain (01DW001) 

Location: West corner, Gymnasium Multipurpose Room 
Results: Pl=32 parts per billion, P2=6 parts per billion 

F01=5 parts per billion, F02=3 parts per billion 

These results suggest the highest contribution of lead may be from the 
bubbler itself. This bubbler fixture is made of chrome plated brass and is 
believed to have a brass valve. The connection piping with the unit may 
also contain some brass components. 

Replacement of this bubbler tap and Its connection plumbing with lead- 
free materials will significantly reduce iead exposure at this location. If 
replacement is not currently feasible, sample results indicate that flushing 
this tap for 3 minutes following periods of stagnation is likely to reduce 
lead concentrations and iead exposure.

While the remaining 25 outlets showed sample results to be at levels requiring no further action, several 
recommendations have been identified. 

The fourth sample (F02) at all 43 outlets following approximately 3 minutes of use and flushing at a reduced 
flow resulted in reduced lead concentrations of 3 parts per billion or less. This indicates that flushing of all 
taps used for drinking, cooking, and/or food preparation for 4 minutes following periods of stagnation will 
further reduce lead exposure. It is recommended that a flushing operational procedure be developed for use 
by staff responsible for plumbing operations and maintenance with emphasis on flushing after weekends and 
holidays. 

Seventeen of these twenty' five outlets are comprised of similar materials as the outlets listed above and 
could potentially experience higher lead levels under extended periods of stagnation. These faucets/fountains 
include;

Replacement of these fixtures with lead free materials is also recommended. 

The remaining eight outlets showed sample results of 15 parts per billion or less, requiring no further action 
or additional recommendations. These faucets/fountains include: 

* Sink Faucets in Classroom 102 (01CF010) and the Clinic (01CFQ06) 

* Kitchen Faucets in the Community Room Kitchen (01KC005), Classroom 206 (02CF030), Out

The consecutive samples taken on October 31, 2015, at three sites in the main school building and one site 
from each of the two out building units all provide additional confirmation that the highest contribution of lead 
appears to be from the individual faucet/fcuntains and not from the larger diameter supply plumbing within 
the main school building or the two out building units. Results of the consecutive sample monitoring are listed 
in the table below.

The DEO recommends school facilities take action if samples from any drinking water outlets show copper 
ievels greater than 1.3 parts per million. Based on the sampling conducted at43faucets/fountains on October 
31, 2015, the foliowing two drinking water outiets both located in Outbuilding Unit 1, had copper water level 
results greater than 1.3 parts per million. These two outiets are listed below with their sample results. While 
the remaining two outlets in Outbuilding Unit 1 had satisfactory copper results, copper results from all four 
outlets in Outbuilding Unit. 1, along with the consecutive sample results for Outbuilding Unit 1, suggests that 
copper leaching is occurring in the building plumbing and copper service line due to excessive stagnation and 
lack of use. Additional work with the school will be performed by the DEQ to address this issue.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 3, 2015, DHHS released blood lead level testing data. The data covered 
the time frame between January 1 , 201 0, and November 1 3, 2015. The data was 
broken down by population set and by demographic. The population sets included the 
state of Michigan as a whole, Genesee County as a whole, and the city of Flint ZIP 
Codes 48501 to 48507. The demographic sets broke the populations down into the age 
groups of: “Children younger than 6 Years Old,” “Children 6 to 17 Years Old,” “Adults 18 
Years and Older,” and “Total Number of People of All Ages Tested.” 

On December 3, 2015, the DEQ released the lead in drinking water data and final report 
for Eisenhower Elementary School. The findings in the report were very similar in 
nature to those found in the report for Freeman Elementary School. There were a 
number of fixtures and plumbing immediately adjacent to fixtures that were imparting 
lead into the water. The report recommends replacement of these fixtures and related 
plumbing. 

On December 4 and 5, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted a plumbing 
evaluation and subsequent sampling of the fixtures used for drinking water consumption 
at Potter Elementary School in Flint. There were a total number of 288 samples taken 
at 57 different locations throughout the school. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report since last week. 

Concerns : 

There are no new concerns to report since last week. 

Significant Events : 

On November 30, 2015, Director Dan Wyant and George Krisztian met with water 
quality expert Dr. Joan Rose of Michigan State University. The purpose of the meeting 
was to discuss the situation in Flint and to seek guidance on approaches for addressing 
the issue. Dr. Rose expressed that she felt there were three different fronts necessary 
to address the issue. These were to create a “Trust Plan,” a “Communications Plan,” 
and a plan to “Get the lead out.” Dr. Rose provided several different examples of 
communities that had undergone similar challenges and what approaches worked and 
what approaches did not.

On December 3, 2015, representatives from the Governor’s office, DEQ, and Office of 
Urban Initiatives met with Flint City Mayor Karen Weaver and members of her transition 
team. The purpose of the meeting was primarily introductory in nature, and the 
conversations were at a high level discussing the needs of the city as well as how 
communications with the residents of the city could be improved. There was also 
discussion of the lead testing results, both for home owners and in the schools. There 
was particular interest in the sampling protocol that was used to obtain samples in the 
schools. Overall, the conversation was very positive, with everyone agreeing that a 
coordinated effort was necessary to be able to effectively address the lead issue. 

On December 3, 201 5, Director Dan Wyant was interviewed by Lori Jane Gliha for a 
segment on America Tonight. The questions mainly focused on what had happened in 
the past and were tough. The responses echoed the message that the DEQ 
empathizes with the residents of Flint; we are committed to bringing about a resolution; 
we have a plan; we are moving forward; and we recognize that we need to rebuild trust 
in the community. 

On December 4, 2015, representatives of the DEQ (Jim Sygo, Karen Tommasulo, and 
George Krisztian) met with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and other city officials for the 
weekly coordination meeting. Calling into the meeting were representatives of DHHS 
and DLARA. The blood lead data that DHHS released the previous day was discussed, 
and Dr. Eden Wells provided detailed comment on the data. There was also detailed 
discussion regarding the Revolving Loan Fund and how it might be utilized to help 
address the issue of lead service line replacement. 

On December 4, 2015, representatives of the DEQ (Jim Sygo, Karen Tommasulo, and 
George Krisztian) met with Flint Community Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab. The 
main topic of discussion was a review of the lead in drinking water data obtained to 
date. Superintendent Tawwab was informed that the schools, in general, were all 
following a similar pattern in that the sources of lead appear to be coming primarily from 
fixtures and the adjacent plumbing. Superintendent Tawwab indicated that his office 
has already made the decision to follow all recommendations in the reports. It was also 
agreed that a monthly meeting would be helpful to ensure that the process kept moving 
forward. In addition, there was discussion about a document that the DEQ would create 
that would explain what constituted a part per billion or ppb. A draft document without 
graphics was given to Superintendent Tawwab, and he indicated that the final version 
would be a very helpful aid to parents and students. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• Draft sampling instructions were developed for lead and copper compliance 

sampling, incorporating comments by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). The revised document is being sent back to the EPA for final comment.

• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff to assist with development of a phosphate fact 
sheet. DHHS is the lead on this and will be submitting a revised version to the 
DEQ for final comment. This document is being developed to answer home 
owner questions regarding the safety of the addition of phosphate to the water 
received by the city of Flint from Detroit. 

• Staff from the DEQ provided a “Standby Operations” letter to the city of Flint. 

The purpose of the letter is to define what practices are to be utilized in the event 
of an emergency. 

• Staff from the DEQ followed up with the city of Flint on the status of the 
installation of corrosion control treatment. Pumps were installed on 
November 30, 201 5. It is anticipated that the startup of the system will begin 
during the week of December 7, 201 5.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 9, 201 5, DEQ staff held a conference call with staff from the city of Flint 
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to discuss DEQ’s comments 
regarding EPA’s preliminary assessment of corrosion control optimization for the city of 
Flint. The preliminary assessment was to identify and document activities necessary to 
enable the EPA and the DEQ to provide advice and support the city in maintaining 
optimal corrosion control while maintaining their source of water from Detroit as well as 
during and after the upcoming transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) 
pipeline. During the discussion, it was agreed that the document needed to be broken 
down into two separate documents. The first document would identify the absolute 
needs necessary for Flint to transition to the KWA for their source water. The second 
document would outline actions that the city of Flint could take moving forward that 
would provide useful scientific information but would not impede the transition to the 
KWA. 

On December 1 1 , 2015, staff from the DEQ, the EPA, and the city of Flint, along with 
their consultant (Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. [LAN]), met to discuss the various 
projects that needed to be completed in order for the city to switch its water source to 
the KWA. The main topic of discussion was how to balance the overarching concern of 
ensuring that the transition did not create safety issues, while at the same time taking 
precautions to ensure that the project did not run overtime or over budget. There were 
a number of proposals made during the discussion, and LAN will meet with the EPA on 
December 15, 2015, to discuss the various options in more detail. 

On December 1 1 and 12, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted a plumbing 
evaluation and subsequent sampling of the fixtures used for drinking water consumption 
at the Flint Community School’s administration building and Holmes 3-6 STEM 
Academy in Flint. There were a total number of 74 samples taken at 12 different 
locations throughout the administration building and 222 samples taken at 43 different 
locations throughout the school. There were 296 samples taken in total at the two 
facilities. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report since last week. 

Concerns : 

During the meeting on December 1 1 , 201 5, among the DEQ, the EPA, the city of Flint, 
and LAN, the EPA proposed that the city of Flint run a 12-inch line in addition to the 
existing main that would enable the city of Flint to conduct in-depth studies for switching 
to the KWA. The cost of this line would be approximately $4 million, and currently there 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


is no funding source identified that could cover this expense. The city expressed 
concerns that it was being asked to cover expenses for measures that other supplies 
would not be expected to implement. LAN will meet with the EPA to discuss other 
options. 

Significant Event : 

On December 8, 2015, the Department of Technology, Management and Budget 
(DTMB) confirmed that the e-mail sent from Liane Shekter Smith on August 25, 2015, to 
Lee-Anne Walters was successfully delivered to the gmail.com system at the e-mail 
address provided by Ms. Walters. The DTMB was asked to confirm delivery of that 
e-mail based on an accusation that the DEQ never responded to an inquiry, and then 
when a copy of the original e-mail was provided, an accusation was made with respect 
to the authenticity of the e-mail. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• DHHS incorporated comments from the DEQ regarding a phosphate fact sheet 
being designed for public education purposes. DHHS then finalized the fact 
sheet utilizing the suggestions provided by the DEQ. 

• Instructions for lead and copper sampling were finalized, based on comments 
received from the EPA. The final draft was shared with city of Flint personnel on 
December 1 1 , 201 5, for use in their next round of lead and copper compliance 
monitoring. Microsoft Word and pdf versions were posted on the DEQ Web site 
on December 14, 2015, to replace the previous version of the instructions. 

• The city of Flint has hired an outside consultant to identify 150 Tier 1 sites for a 
sampling pool for use in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule. This effort 
is being taken to ensure that future sampling events include verified and 
documented Tier 1 sampling sites to ensure compliance with the Lead and 
Copper Rule. 

• DEQ staff visited Control Station #2 to observe the operation of the phosphate 
feed system. The inspection of the phosphate feed system confirmed that the 
system is in operation and the system is dosing at 2.5 mg/I as phosphate. A 
couple of minor provisions had not been completed at the time of the inspection 
but do not currently affect the operation of the supplemental addition of 
phosphate to the water. 

• DEQ staff modified the Act 399 construction permit for the Flint raw water 
transmission line. The modification was needed to allow for rerouting of the 
transmission main due to poor soil conditions that were encountered along the 
original route.

document. 


Prepared by: George Krisztian, Flint Action Plan Coordinator 
Laboratory Director 
Department of Environmental Quality 
Telephone: 


DRINKING WATER LEAD AND COPPER SAMPLING INSTRUCTIONS 


Dear Resident: 

Thank you for helping to monitor for lead and copper in your drinking water. This sampling is 
required by the federal and state Safe Drinking Water Acts, and is being accomplished with 
the cooperation of homeowners, residents, and water system customers. 

It is important that you follow these instructions so we obtain an accurate measurement of the 
lead and copper in your drinking water. This sample should represent the water you would 
typically drink and the faucet from where you drink the water. Select a faucet for sampling 
that was used the day before you intend to sample. Call your water supply if you have 
questions. 

1 . Water must sit idle in the pipes for an extended length of time before sampling. 

Therefore, do not use any water in the house for at least 6 hours before sampling. The 
best times to sample are early morning or after returning from work. 

2. Select an unfiltered/untreated faucet in the KITCHEN or BATHROOM that is commonly 
used for drinking. DO NOT sample from a laundry sink or a hose spigot as these samples 
cannot be used for compliance. DO NOT use a faucet that has a filter attached to it 
unless you bypass the filter. DO NOT use a faucet that is connected to a home water 
treatment device (like a water softener, iron filter, reverse osmosis) unless you bypass the 
home water treatment device. 

3. Place the open sample bottle below the faucet and gently open the COLD water tap. If 
you have a single handle faucet, turn it fully to the COLD side. Fill the sample bottle to 
the neck with the “first draw” of COLD water. 

4. Tightly cap the sample bottle and place in the sample kit provided. Review the sample kit 
label to ensure all information contained on the label is complete and correct. 

5. Answer the questions on the back of this form and sign the form. 

6. Attach this form to the bottle and leave it outside your front door for pick-up. 

7. Thank you again for your help. We will send you your individual results within 30 days of 
receiving them from the laboratory. A summary of information on this year’s lead and 
copper monitoring will be printed in the annual water quality report that will be made 
available by July 1 of next year. Contact your water supply if you have questions.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

DEQ staff set aside additional time this week to address the backlog of FOIA legislative 
requests. 

A conference call with staff from the DEQ, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), and city of Flint was held on December 15, 2015, to discuss the transition to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) as the city’s source of drinking water. The EPA 
indicated that they would provide written recommendations regarding the actions that 
Flint should take prior to switching to the KWA. 

On December 18, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted an initial plumbing 
evaluation of Flint Community Schools’ Northwestern High School and Southwestern 
Classical Academy. These two schools are scheduled for a final evaluation and 
subsequent sampling during the week of December 28, 2015. Due to the 
extracurricular activities that typically take place on the weekends, it was determined 
that the best time to conduct the sampling would be during the winter school break. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report since last week. 

Concern : 

On December 16, 2015, the EPA sent an e-mail to Flint City Administrator, Natasha 
Henderson, outlining the recommended precautionary measures for Flint to implement 
prior to switching to the KWA for their source water. The list of recommendations is 
very broad in nature and could potentially costs millions of dollars to implement. In 
addition, the recommendations could potentially delay the switch to the KWA by several 
months. Given the costs associated with implementing these measures, the city of Flint 
will be working to set up a meeting with Harvey Hollins and George Krisztian to discuss 
funding options, including asking the EPA for assistance. 

Significant Event : 

The DEQ has assigned Eric Pocan, Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance, 
to serve as the project manager to assist the city of Flint with providing the 
documentation necessary for the city to apply for loans under the Drinking Water 
Revolving Loan Fund. A time line outlining the various steps in the process has been 
given to the city of Flint to assist them in ensuring that all requisite documents are 
generated and submitted within the necessary deadlines. Additional follow-up meetings 
will be held to assist the city with any issues related to the submission of the required 
documentation.

Changes from Previous Report : 

• Final plumbing assessment reports for Pierce Elementary and Doyle/Ryder 
Elementary Schools are being prepared. Staff from the DEQ, Office of 
Environmental Assistance, are being trained to assist with the preparation of the 
reports in order to reduce the turnaround time. 

• The MSU Extension provided a release regarding nutrition and lead. The release 
provides resources for utilizing nutrition to lessen the effects of lead exposure. 

• Staff from the DEQ met with staff from the city of Flint on December 1 8, 201 5, to 
discuss the recommendations made by the EPA earlier in the week. The city 
expressed concern that EPA’s recommendations went beyond the requirements 
of the Lead and Copper Rule. It was agreed that further discussion needed to 
occur to determine how these recommendations could be funded. 

• Staff from the DEQ met with the Michigan Association for Local Public Health 
(MALPH). One of the main topics of conversation was the Flint water situation. 
Members of MALPH expressed concern that the lead exposure issues were not 
unique to Flint and that, based on the recent article in Bridge Magazine, the issue 
was statewide and there were areas in the state that had significantly high lead 
exposure levels.

Natasha, 

Attached please find the EPA Flint Drinking Water Task Force Recommendations for a Performance 
Evaluation Period. 

As we discussed on December 11 and December 15, it is important to gain operational experience at the 
Flint Plant prior to distribution of KWA-sourced water. We have informally referred to this as a 
"shakedown" period for ensuring a safe and appropriate transition to the new water source. 

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. We are pleased to continue to work together.

Flint Drinking Water Task Force (FTF 15-5) 


Task Force Recommendations Regarding Flint Drinking Water Treatment Performance 
Evaluation 

For protection of public health, Flint must avoid significant distribution system issues similar to 
those experienced following the source water switch to the Flint River and subsequent operation 
of Flint’s water treatment plant. 

The EPA Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force recommends that Flint develop and implement a 
Performance Assessment Plan prior to distribution of water from the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) source. The plan must address how the treatment plant will be brought on- 
line, and how finished drinking water will be introduced to the distribution system. This plan is 
particularly important given the City has no experience treating the KWA-supplied water, and is 
operating a distribution system that is still recovering from the past upset. 

Flint should work with its consultant and MDEQ to establish objective water quality and plant 
performance criteria. The plan must include operation of Flint’s drinking water treatment plant 
for a reasonable period of time to treat KWA-supplied water until: 

(1) the treated water meets finished water quality goals; 

(2) the finished water quality is consistently maintained; 

(3) potential plant operational and mechanical start-up issues are identified and 
addressed; and 

(4) water plant operations staff are proficient in treating the new source. 

KWA water should not be distributed to the public until these conditions are satisfied. 

During this performance evaluation period, Flint must distribute to the public water from an 
alternate source. As water is already received from Detroit (Great Lakes Water Authority), that 
is an obvious and appropriate choice for that interim period. The length of the performance 
evaluation period will be dependent on the amount of time it takes for the treatment plant to 
consistently and reliably meet the performance criteria. 

Because of similarities in source water and in treatment processes with Detroit’s Fluron plant, the 
Flint water plant will likely be configured to produce treated water with similar quality to that of 
the water currently being received from Detroit. Continued use of Detroit water during the 
performance evaluation period will minimize the risk of distribution system upsets. 

We encourage Flint and the City’s consultant to perform a number of assessments prior to the 
completion of the KWA pipeline and availability of the Lake Ehrron source water to expedite the 
plant transition period. For example, the planned bench-scale jar tests will be helpful in 
establishing full-scale treatment plant operating parameters. Assessment of corrosion control 
treatment using Detroit source water with lead pipe loop rigs in advance of switching to the 
KWA source may also be transferrable to the KWA source water. Pipe loops rigs operated 
during the performance assessment period will help predict whether lead release will be an issue 
when the new plant goes on line. EPA will work with the City to set up pipe loops at the Flint 
treatment plant.

MSU Extension and Hurley Children's Hospital release recipe and nutrition resource guide to help 
people lessen harmful effects of lead 

In the wake of growing concerns about exposure to and health impacts of lead in Flint, Michigan State 
University Extension and Hurley Children's Hospital have released a new nutrition booklet highlighting 
healthful, cost-effective meals that help lessen the harmful effects of lead. The booklet will be available 
beginning Saturday December 19, 12:30 p.m. at the Flint Farmers Market. 

Joanna Sheill, a registered dietitian with Hurley Wellness Services will be facilitating a cooking demo 
featuring one of the booklet's recipes - a hearty egg burrito. Free water filters will also be available at 
the cooking demonstration, courtesy of the Genesee County Health Department. 

"Healthy nutrition is one of the most important things we can do to protect our children from lead 
poisoning," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, director of the Pediatric Residency Program at Hurley 
Children's Hospital and MSU College of Human Medicine. "In collaboration with MSU Extension nutrition 
experts, we have developed this lead-fighting recipe and nutrition resource guide." 

The booklets will be available during weekly cooking demonstrations at the Flint Farmers Market in early 
2016 and also be distributed by MSU Extension nutrition instructors at free nutrition and cooking 
workshops and community events throughout Genesee County. 

"We are delighted to provide this practical guide and recipe booklet to families to help prevent lead 
poisoning," said Dawn Contreras, MSU Extension's director of health and nutrition programs. "We want 
to protect our family members against the harmful effects of lead and an important way of doing that is 
through good nutrition." 

The booklet features 10 healthful recipes that focus on low-cost ingredients, many of which people will 
likely already have in their pantries and cupboards. Recipes include chocolate strawberry French toast, 
vegetable lasagna and roasted butternut squash. Contact information for several food assistance 
programs and other resources in Genesee County, including Women Infants and Children (WIC), 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Double Up Food Bucks is also listed in the 
booklet. 

These programs help families throughout Michigan access healthy, nutritious and low-cost foods and are 
essential to helping Flint navigate through this challenging time, said Dr. Hanna-Attisha. 

The recipes in the booklet are provided via the Share Our Strength Cooking Matters curricula, which 
MSU Extension delivers throughout Michigan to help people learn how to eat healthy, cook and grocery 
shop on a limited budget. 

For more information about the nutrition booklet, please contact Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha at 
mhannal@hurievmc.com or MSU Extension Educator Erin Powell at poweHe9@msu.edu or 810-244- 



8536. MSU Extension also offers free nutrition classes in the Flint area, for more details visit 
msue.anr.msu.edu or call 810-244-8500.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 28-29, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted the formal 
plumbing evaluation of Flint Community Schools’ Northwestern High School and 
Southwestern Classical Academy. On December 29-30 staff from DEQ and DLARA 
then performed the follow-up sampling of the drinking fountains and faucets that are 
used for consumptive purposes at these two facilities. This completes the initial 
evaluation process for all 13 schools of the Flint Community Schools. Once the Flint 
Community Schools has had an opportunity to incorporate the recommendations in the 
plumbing evaluation reports, a follow-up sampling will be scheduled to ensure that all of 
the issues have been properly addressed. 


Evaluations of the Flint Community Schools will continue to be posted to the Flint water 
Web site: www.mi.gov/fjintwater . These reports are being shared with Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab first and then posted. So far, three reports have 
been posted, with the remaining reports expected to be completed by the end of 
January 2016. 


A list of schools and childcare facilities served by the Flint water system requesting a 
plumbing evaluation has been created. These facilities will be contacted during the first 
two weeks in January to schedule a free plumbing evaluation of their facilities. The 
protocol used will be the same one used for the Flint Community Schools. To date, 
there are a total of 10 facilities that have requested a plumbing evaluation. Once these 
10 facilities have been scheduled, efforts will be made to reach out to additional facilities 
that may wish to take advantage of this free program. 


Video footage was taken on December 29, 2015, of the plumbing evaluation process 
and the sampling protocol of the drinking fountains and faucets at Flint Community 
Schools’ Northwestern High School and Southwestern Classical Academy. This 
footage is being used to create a video that provides an easy-to-understand explanation 
of how the plumbing evaluations and subsequent sampling is being done in the schools. 
The target audience for this video is primarily the residents of Flint so that they can get 
a visual of the efforts already underway, but it is anticipated that this video will also be 
used as an instructional aid for schools elsewhere in Michigan that are interested in 
having their facilities evaluated.

Significant Event : 

On December 29, 2015, Dan Wyant resigned his position as Director of the DEQ. DNR 
Director Keith Creagh has been appointed Interim Director of the DEQ. Reports have 
been created and meetings have been scheduled to provide Director Creagh with a 
history of the Flint situation as well as current plans for moving forward. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• The Flint water Web site has been redesigned. The old site was beginning to 
become cluttered and information was becoming difficult to locate. The new 
design provides a more user friendly interface and has a more elegant flow. It is 
anticipated that the redesigned Web site will go live during the week of January 4, 
2016. 

• The DEQ Laboratory identified a lead result as being alarmingly high. This result 
was conveyed to Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian so that the 
customer could be contacted instead of waiting for the final report to go out. 
Investigation of the address revealed that the sample was taken at the Whaley 
Children’s Center. The facility was contacted, and the contact there was notified 
that one of the samples that they submitted was in excess of 2,500 parts per 
billion (ppb), or more than 160 times higher than the federally-mandated action 
level of 1 5 ppb. The contact was instructed to take measures to ensure that 
water from that point was not being used for consumptive purposes. Since the 
facility provided childcare, Mr. Krisztian described the free plumbing evaluation 
service available and offered to put Whaley Children’s Center on the list of 
facilities being evaluated. The contact indicated that they would provide the 
information to management for consideration. 

• A review of the results from the free lead testing offered to all Flint residents 
since November 1 , 201 5, show a downward trend compared to results from 
those prior to November 1 , 201 5. This can be attributed to a number of factors. 
The switch to using water from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, the 
implementation of supplemental phosphate addition, and the colder temperatures 
are all possible contributing factors in this trend. 

Since November 1 , 201 5, a total of 298 samples have been submitted and 
analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory. Of these samples, 248 or 83.2% show 
concentrations of 5 ppb or less. In addition, 279 samples or 93.6% show 
concentrations at or below the action level of 15 ppb. 

While this data is encouraging and indicates that the Flint water supply is moving 
towards compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), it is imperative to 
view this data cautiously. The LCR specifies what sampling points may be used 
for compliance purposes. The data for these samples is nonselective and 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 3 


potentially may not be coming from distribution points that would be allowed 
under the LCR. In addition, although the paperwork indicates that samples 
should not go through a filter, it is possible that some residents are using the free 
lead testing service to ensure the filters that have been provided do, in fact, 
remove lead. 

Other Item : 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing data for samples submitted by Flint residents 
through the free lead testing program.

1. What are the water test results from the public

2. How many free test have been requested? How

no lead, lead consistent with history, higher levels? 

3. How many fdters have been distributed? How

4. New blood test results? Especially in the two zip

Subject: FYI- Release going shortly re: Flint Emergency Declaration 

Good afternoon, 

Just wanted you all to know that we're issuing the following press release shortly regarding the Governor declaring an 
emergency in Genesee County and activating the State Emergency Operations Center. The declaration will be attached 
with it. 

Thanks! 

Gov. Snyder declares emergency for Genesee County 

State Emergency Operations Center activated to assist with relief efforts 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today declared a state of emergency for Genesee County 
due to the ongoing health and safety issues caused by lead in the city of Flint’s drinking water. 

By declaring a state of emergency, Snyder has made available all state resources in cooperation 
with local response and recovery operations. The declaration authorizes the Michigan State 
Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division (MSP/EMHSD) to coordinate 
state efforts. 

“The health and welfare of Flint residents is a top priority and we’re committed to a coordinated 
approach with resources from state agencies to address all aspects of this situation,” Snyder said. 
“Working in full partnership with the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, all levels of government and 
water quality experts, we will find both short-term and long-term solutions to ensure the health and 
safety of Flint residents.” 

In addition to the emergency declaration, Snyder activated the State Emergency Operations 
Center to coordinate state response and recovery activities. State agencies will report to the 
center to coordinate resources, assess the situation and begin providing assets to assist with local 
relief operations. 


i 



“Our staff recognizes the urgency of this situation and is already working closely with local 
officials,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, Deputy State Director of Emergency Management and 
Homeland Security and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. “We will continue to collaborate with 
state, city and county leaders to coordinate relief efforts, streamline communication and use all 
available resources to help residents.” 

On Jan. 4, Genesee County declared a “local state of emergency,” which activated local 
emergency response and recovery plans. By requesting a governor’s declaration, the county has 
determined local resources are insufficient to address the situation and state assistance is 
required to protect public health, safety and property to lessen or avert the threat of a crisis. 

The city of Flint has been under a local emergency declaration since Dec. 14, 2015. 

The SEOC is the emergency operations center for the state of Michigan. Located in Lansing, the 
center is overseen by the MSP/EMHSD and coordinates response and recovery efforts by state 
agencies and local government. The SEOC is staffed by members of state agencies and other 
partners for decision making and information coordination during disasters or emergencies in the 
state of Michigan.

Administrator 

Environmental Protection Agency 
1 200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW 
Washington, D.C. 20460 

Mr. Dan Wyant 
Director 

Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
P.O. Box 30473 
Lansing, Ml 48909 

Administrator McCarthy and Director Wyant: 

The attached June 24, 2015, memorandum between two Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) employees, Miguel A. Del Toral and Thomas Poy, published recently by the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, suggests that there are high lead levels in the city of Flint, 
Mich., water transmission lines. Furthermore, this document reflects that children consuming this 
water had levels of lead in their blood in excess of three times what they were prior to the city of 
Flint switching its source w'atcr from the Detroit Water and Sewage Department (DWSD) to the 
Flint. River. 


In addition, this memorandum, makes recommendations to Mr. Poy, Chief of the Ground Water 
and Drinking Water Branch of EPA Region 5, to do three things. First, for the EPA to work with 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to provide technical assistance to 
the city of Flint to deal with water quality issues. Second, it suggests the EPA review the 
compliance status of the city of Flint in respect to its compliance with tine Lead and Copper Rule 
(LCR). Third, the memorandum recommends that the EPA conduct a review of the city of Flint 
testing procedures to ensure they are compliant with the LCR. 

Regarding this memorandum and the surrounding water quality issues in the city of Flint, I have 
the following questions: 

® Was this memorandum actually sent to Mr. Poy? 





Are the findings in the memorandum regarding the lead levels in the city of Flint water 
accurate? 


» If there were in fact high levels of lead in the water m the city of Flint, when did the EFA 
and/or MDEQ plan to alert the public? 

* What, if any, of the recommendations has the EPA followed from the memorandum? 

* Given the demonstrated level of lead in the water in Flint, MI, is the water safe? 

Regardless, 1 am very troubled by recent tests suggesting high levels of lead in the city of Flint’s 
water system. As you know, on the EPA’s website it says that lead above the “action level” in 
drinking water can cause a variety of adverse health effects, including delays in physical and 
mental development in babies and children. 

According to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has the responsibility of enforcing water 
quality standards. EPA, however, has given the primary responsibility of enforcing water quality 
standards to the state of Michigan via MDEQ. As such, it. is the responsibility of these agencies 
to ensure that the people of the city of Flint have safe drinking water. 

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 


Sincerely,

VIA E-MAIL 

The Honorable Daniel Kildee 

United States House of Representatives 

Washington, DC 20515 

Dear Congressman Kildee: 

Thank you for your September 9, 2015, letter regarding your concerns for the drinking water 
in the city of Flint (Flint). The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) is 
working closely with Flint’s water department as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (USEPA) to ensure Flint residents have ample water that meets state and federal 
drinking water standards. 

The MDEQ’s role is to administer its nearly 40-year-old state drinking water protection 
program based on federal guidelines. The MDEQ works with approximately 1 1,500 public 
water systems in the state to monitor for more than 90 primary drinking water contaminants 
and ensure that every supply consistently provides safe drinking water. 

In Flint, the city made a decision 18 months ago to switch drinking water sources. This 
change required them to take specific measures under the federal Lead and Copper Rule, 
which was enacted in 1991 to monitor water as it interacts with lead service connections 
and home plumbing. Flint’s test results were conducted according to the same testing 
protocols every Michigan community uses and the same protocols Flint has used to test its 
water every three years for the past 25 years. 

While the results from Flint’s testing show compliance with the federal action level for lead 
and copper, on August 17, 2015, the MDEQ instructed the city to move forward 
expeditiously with developing additional corrosion control treatment to minimize the 
corrosive effects between drinking water and lead service connections and home plumbing 
in the Flint service area. 

We appreciate and share your concern for the situation, and the MDEQ looks forward to 
providing you a detailed briefing next week. If you have any additional questions in the 
meantime, please contact Ms. Maggie Pallone, Deputy Director, Policy and Legislative 
Affairs, at 517-284-6704 or pallonem@michigan.gov; or you may contact me.

The Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor, State of Michigan 
P.O.Box 30013 
Lansing, Ml 48909 

RE: Call for Additional Support for Flint Water Improvement Plan 
Dear Governor Snyder: 

On behalf of the Flint community, I am writing with a renewed request for additional support to 
address Flint’s water challenges to ensure that water is affordable and secure for everyone in Flint 
especially our vulnerable populations. I am asking for an additional $30 million in funds for Flint’s 
infrastructure and a new healthy homes initiative. 

Significant progress has been made throughout this year to increase water safety and quality and I 
thank you for the involvement of your office, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 
and the Michigan Department of Treasury. A majority of items in the Water Improvement Plan 
are completed or underway. Most importantly, Flint is now in compliance with the Safe Drinking 
Water Act due in lar ge part to the installation of the new carbon filter. The infrastructure systems 
are being made more secure and efficient through the State grants. Now the City is committed to 
following the recommendation of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to optimize 
the treatment process, reduce corrosion and further minimize risks from lead. 

The need to accelerate the City’s capital improvement investments remains and has been further 
increased by the continued financial stress and legal issues. Previously I requested support for 
replacement or forgiveness of payment to the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund due to Flint’s 
status as a distressed community and the gap in funding in the adopted capital improvement plan. 
I understand that the existing federal law does not allow the existing Drinking Water Revolving 
Loans that Flint is carrying to be forgiven in retrospect but the need still exists. Flint owes 
approximately $20 Million. One solution is for the State to grant a new $20 Million that is designed 
as forgivable from the start. Another solution is to provide

equivalent funding through an expansion of the grant program to Michigan’s Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships with a supplemental budget amendment in cooperation 
with the State Legislature, 

The community’s heightened concern about lead leeching into the water from old service lines and 
home plumbing also needs to be addressed. We know that lead is an environmental contaminant 
and there have been many programs in place over the years to address sources in paint and pipes. 
Flint needs a new healthy homes initiative specifically focused on lead in water with $10 Million 
to start the process of replacing service lines for the most vulnerable households. Regardless of the 
source and treatment of Flint’s water, this long term threat of lead in pipes needs to be removed in 
the interest of public health. 

My approach continues to be to work with you and your appointed officials. State Senator Ananich, 
State Representatives Phelps and Neeley, Congressman Kildee, community groups, businesses, 
churches, foundations, the Flint City Council, and all of the City of Flint and State and Federal 
government personnel. We need every available expert and resource to address Flint’s water 
problems. 

Flint’s safety is my top priority. Just as the City and State have worked together on public safety, 
we need additional support for fixing the water problems. We need $30 Million in new funds to 
repair and update the city-wide infrastructure and to assist households in becoming lead-free. The 
entire Flint community deserves sustainable, safe, secure and affordable water now and into the 
future. Thank you for the consideration Governor and I look forward to future discussions.

Subject: Flint Water Issue - Rep. Kildee Letter Received By Federal Agencies 

Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig 
Fugate of FEMA, HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, 
Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated 
with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he 
called me about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they 
need to work through the local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are 
working through the local health department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs 
water or want water the first step is to handle it locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any 


l 


gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local EM has done in this regard. I will be 
with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, this week if they have 
questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DFIHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Pr otest Go v. Rick Snyde r in Attn Arbor TOMORROW 

A group of local activists is planning a protest of Gov. Snyder and his policies TOMORROW. Sera 
summary of some of the scandals enveloping the Snyder administration, click rojo... Here are the 
details for the protest: 

U-M has invited Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder to be a keynote speaker at an information technology 
conference on campus, SUMIT. Snyder is a far right politician who has imposed dictatorial Emergency 
Managers and Emergency Financial Managers on majonty-poor-Siack communities and school districts 
in Michigan including Flint , Benton Harbor, Pontiac, Detroit, and others, ir, Flint, Snyder’s Emergency 
Manager switched the water supply from Detroit water to Fiint water in April 2014, leading to a public 
health crisis in which city water was contaminated with up to 6 times the allowable level of teed. 

Snyder's brand of "innovation" and "relentless positive action" means destroying the common good in 
Michigan. In addition to imposing Emergency Managers, in a lame-duck legislative session in 2012 he 
and his party rushed through a suite of extreme anti-choice laws, as well as union-destroying Right to 
Work laws. 

WHERE: Outside Rackh&m Building, 915 E. Washington, Ann Arbor Mi 
WHEN: 1:00 PM Thursday October 22 

Tell U-M that Snyder and his poisonous, democracy-destroying austerity is not welcome on 
campus i

Governor Rick Snyder 
Executive Office of the Governor 
P.O, Box 30013 
Lansing, Michigan 4S9G9 


Governor Snyder: 

I would like to provide you an update with some of the work we are doing in response to your 
letter on October 2, 201 5 letter. I also have three requests of the state that are necessary to 
provide relief to the victims of the Flint water crisis. 

First, Senator Stabenow, Senator Peters and I wrote a letter to the IDS. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EFA) asking for clarification on whether federal Saw penults states to use Safe Drinking 
Water State Revolving Funds (Revolving Funds) to finance the replacement of privately owned 
lead water service lines (attached). The EPA responded that the Revolving Funds can in fact be 
used for this purpose. My office immediately notified both your office and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality of this fact 

Secondly, the three of us also wrote to Secretary Tom Vilsack requesting that the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide greater clarification on the availability of “Ready to 
Feed” formula for recipients of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (W1C) in Flint, Additionally, the letter asks to identify resources to improve the 
nutrition of Flint residents specifically as it relates to lead, because a certain diet can reduce 
some of the impact of exposure. The USDA is currently reviewing the letter. 

Third, I have been working with the EPA on important revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule 
that would prevent a public health crisis like the one in Flint from happening again in other 
communities. I will be providing testimony at a meeting of the National Drinking Water 
Advisory Council next Wednesday, November 18 on what we have learned firsthand in Flint and 
the necessary' improvements to the Lead and Copper Rule. 



I will continue to pursue all of these avenues in order to find assistance for the people of Flint, 
There are, however, additional steps that need to he taken to remediate the damage done to the 
people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of 
Flint' s Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available, I urge state and local partners to 
work in coordination to fulfill the following requests, 

* Firsf I request that the state of Michigan use its Revolving Funds and other state 
resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair the damage done to Flint’s 
water distribution system. 

Due to the corrosive nature of the water, conservative estimates show there has been hundreds of 
millions of dollars of damage done to Flint 5 s water distribution system. The damage to the 
system will increase maintenance costs resnlting in higher rates for Flint water users, who 
already are burdened by the highest water rates in the state. Furthermore, the presence of over 
15,000 lead service lines continues to threaten the quality of the water and creates the potential 
for future lead exposure through drinking water. As stated previously, the EFA has said that 
using the Revolving Funds for this purpose is allowed under federal law, and 1 request the state 
do so, 

* Second, I request the state create a fund for ongoing assistance to the people of Flint to 
respond to the impacts of lead exposure. 

The effects of lead are serious and permanent, with especially harmful impacts on young 
children and those with weakened immune systems. In discussions with health professionals, 
they have expressed the need for significant investments in the local, health system in order to 
respond to the widespread exposure of lead to tire people of Flint, including monitoring of figure 
lead exposure. Tills fund should include support for, at a minimum, continuous health 
monitoring, early education programs, nutrition education, support sendees for children to 
succeed in school, and continued exposure prevention efforts. The investments we make now to 
combat the negative impacts of lead exposure will pay dividends in avoided costs in the future. 

* Finally, 1 again ask that the state immediately reverse course and rescind Flint’s 
obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting to the Detroit water system 
and refund any money the city' of Flint has had to pay. 

Requiring a financially distressed city and its people to pay for the state’s failures is an 
abdication of dear responsibility' by the state. The state-appointed emergency manager was in 
charge of the city of Flint during the time that die decision to leave the Detroit system was made. 
;The state - not Flint ■ ■ created this water crisis, and the State needs to pay to fix it. The $2 million 
Flint spent to reconnect to the Detroit water system could he used for many other essential 
services in Flint, such as hiring policemen and firefighters, improving schools and maintaining 



In addition to state investments, I encourage the state to request assistance from federal agencies. 
They have extensive experience working with health, education and nutrition systems nationwide 
and could provide critical resources to state officials. Specifically, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention has offered resources if the state requests it. 1 will work to support any 
efforts for federal assistance the state makes. 

I look forward to working with the state and federal governments to not only provide clean 
drinking water to the people of Flint immediately, but also repair the damage done to the city’s 
water system and give local health professionals the resources they need to combat die long term 
impacts of lead exposure.

RE: request for comment on congressman's letter 
Kildee nov 13 2015 latest letter.pdf 


I do not believe we should respond to this over the top letter for both legal and philosophical reasons. Responding to 
this just feeds his narrative. How about we not issue a letter in response? Here's my issues: 


1. First paragraph, top of second page, "...additional steps that need to be taken to remediate the damage done 
to the people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of Flint's 
Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available." Ail of these emotionally charged and essentially 
unfounded accusations suggest the state's culpability in levying damages to "the people of Flint". There are 
definitely people in Flint (mostly poor and without many resources but also many other people) struggling with 
an old system, brown water, lead and unsavory health problems that have been put through several months of 
alarm and struggle, but let's try to deal with human beings and not political bombast. Let's identify and solve 
problems. Literally hundreds of state employees have worked night and day to resolve these issues. Are we 
going to blame state employees indiscriminately when our people were simply trying to do their jobs to the best 
of their ability and were unable to anticipate (for whatever reason) all the consequences? 

2. First bullet point, "...and other state resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair damage 
done...". Sorry, but we're not going to commit the general fund to repair "...Flint's water distribution 
system." What does that mean? And if we sign on to that then where does it stop and what repairs? 

3. Second paragraph. "... hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.,..". Where did this come from? I take it the 
Congressman is now a self-appointed expert on water systems and their cost? 

4. Second bullet, "...the state create a fund for ongoing assistance.,.." We already have several funds to deal with 
lead exposure and we have multiple programs, WIC, Medicaid, health endowment, etc. to assist people in 
need. Why would we create another fund? 

5. Third paragraph, "...need for significant investments in the local health system in order to respond....". We 
already make significant investments in the local system. They were able to identify the danger early and I 
would assume they will he significant players in the future. Additionally, DHHS has a myriad of programs already 
In place to assist the local health system, which I don't need to remind everyone is a city owned hospital and for 
whatever reason never consulted by the city when the KVv'A conversion was being studied and proposed. That 
system also never objected nor tested the Flint River before, even though the river was always the city's source 
backup. Even the proposal prior to the state's involvement considered using two million gallons of Flint River 
water and that was a public record. But, that's another issue best left to another time. 

6. Third bullet "...rescind Flint's obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting....". The state gave the 
city $2.1 million to help the water system during the summer, and part of the agreement to get the $6 million 
from the legislature for the emergency was contingent on Flint contributing a share. 

7. Fourth paragraph, "...for the state's failures is an abdication of clear responsibility.,..". First of all, it's not a 
state's failures, it is a perhaps avoidable mistake made with the corrosives that was unacceptable to us, the 
Director and Governor are taking actions to fix the problems, the health and wellness of the people of Flint is 
our absolute concern, and it's not an abdication of dear responsibility. The "...state-appointed emergency 
manager was in charge..." may ‘well be accurate for the physical change, but the decision to leave the Detroit 
system was made when the city, the Mayor, the council, the county, local leaders and the KWA was devised and 
that was well before the physical change. 

For these reasons and others, I'd prefer Sara's general assistance and aid comments and not responding to the letter.

Governor Rick Snyder 
Executive Office of the Governor 
P.O, Box 30013 
Lansing, Michigan 4S9G9 


Governor Snyder: 

I would like to provide you an update with some of the work we are doing in response to your 
letter on October 2, 201 5 letter. I also have three requests of the state that are necessary to 
provide relief to the victims of the Flint water crisis. 

First, Senator Stabenow, Senator Peters and I wrote a letter to the IDS. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EFA) asking for clarification on whether federal Saw penults states to use Safe Drinking 
Water State Revolving Funds (Revolving Funds) to finance the replacement of privately owned 
lead water service lines (attached). The EPA responded that the Revolving Funds can in fact be 
used for this purpose. My office immediately notified both your office and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality of this fact 

Secondly, the three of us also wrote to Secretary Tom Vilsack requesting that the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide greater clarification on the availability of “Ready to 
Feed” formula for recipients of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (W1C) in Flint, Additionally, the letter asks to identify resources to improve the 
nutrition of Flint residents specifically as it relates to lead, because a certain diet can reduce 
some of the impact of exposure. The USDA is currently reviewing the letter. 

Third, 1 have been working with the EPA on important revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule 
that would prevent a public health crisis like the one in Flint from happening again in other 
communities. I will be providing testimony at a meeting of the National Drinking Water 
Advisory Council next Wednesday, November 18 on what we have learned firsthand in Flint and 
the necessary' improvements to the Lead and Copper Rule. 


1 will continue to pursue all of these avenues in order to find assistance for the people of Flint. 
There are, however, additional steps that need to he taken to remediate the damage done to the 
people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of 
Flint's Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available. I urge state and local partners to 
work in coordination to fulfill the following requests, 

® First 1 request that the state of Michigan use its Revolving Funds and other state 
resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair the damage done to Flint’s 
water distribution system. 

Due to the corrosive nature of the water, conservative estimates show there has been hundreds of 
millions of dollars of damage done to Flint’s water distribution system. The damage to the 
system will increase maintenance costs resulting in higher rates for Flint water users, who 
already are burdened by the highest water rates in the state. Furthermore, the presence of over 
15,000 lead service lines continues to threaten the quali ty of the water and creates the potential 
for future lead exposure through drinking water. As stated previously, the EPA has said that 
using the Revolving Funds for this purpose is allowed under federal law, and I request the state 
do so. 


® Second, I request the state create a fond for ongoing assistance to the people of Flint to 
respond to the impacts of lead exposure. 

Hie effects of lead are serious arid permanent, with especially harmful impacts on young 
children and those with weakened immune systems. In discussions with health professionals, 
they have expressed the need for significant investments in the local health system in order to 
respond to the widespread exposure of lead to the people of Flint including monitoring of future 
lead exposure. This fund should include support for, at a minimum, continuous health 
monitoring, early education programs, nutrition education, support sendees for children to 
succeed in school, and continued exposure prevention efforts. The investments we make now to 
combat the negative impacts of lead exposure will pay dividends in avoided costs In the future, 

® Finally, I again ask that the state immediately reverse course rad rescind Flint’s 
obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting to the Detroit water system 
and refund any money the city of Flint has had to pay. 

Requiring a financially distressed city and its people to pay tor the state’s failures is an 
abdication of dear responsibility'’ by the state. The state-appointed emergency manager was in 
charge of the city of Flint during the time that the decision to leave the Detroit system was made. 
The state ^ not Flint - created this water crisis, and the state needs to pay to fix it. The $2 million 
Flint spent to reconnect to the Detroit water system could be used for many other essential 
services in Flint, such as hiring policemen and firefighters, improving schools rad maintaining 
parks. 



In addition to state investments, I encourage the state to request assistance from federal agencies. 
They have extensive experience working with health, education and nutrition systems nationwide 
and could provide critical resources to state officials. Specifically, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention has offered resources if the state requests it. 1 will work to support any 
efforts for federal assistance the state makes. 

I look forward to working with the state and federal governments to not only provide clean 
drinking water to the people of Flint immediately, but also repair the damage done to the city’s 
water system and give local health professionals the resources they need to combat die long term 
impacts of lead exposure.

alarm and struggle, but let's try to deal with human beings and not political bombast. Let's identify and solve 
problems. Literally hundreds of state employees have worked night and day to resolve these issues. Are we 
going to blame state employees indiscriminately when our people were simply trying to do their jobs to the best 
of their ability and were unable to anticipate (for whatever reason) all the consequences? 


l 



2. First bullet point "...and other state resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair damage 
done...". Sorry, but we're not going to commit the general fund to repair "... Flint's water distribution 
system." What does that mean? And if we sign on to that then where does it stop and what repairs? 

3. Second paragraph, "...hundreds of millions of dollars of damage....". Where did this come from? i take it the 
Congressman is now a self-appointed expert on water systems and their cost? 

4. Second bullet, "...the state create a fund for ongoing assistance...." We already have several funds to deal with 
lead exposure and we have multiple programs. Wit. Medicaid, health endowment, etc. to assist people in 
need. Why would we create another fund? 

5. Third paragraph, "...need for significant investments in the local health system in order to respond....". We 
already make significant investments in the local system. They were able to identify the danger early and I 
would assume they will be significant players in the future. Additionally, DHHS has a myriad of programs already 
in place to assist the local health system, which i don't need to remind everyone is a city owned hospital and for 
whatever reason never consulted by the city when the KWA conversion was being studied and proposed. That 
system also never objected nor tested the Flint River before, even though the river was always the city's source 
backup. Even the proposal prior to the state's involvement considered using two million gallons of Flint River 
water and that was a public record. But, that's another issue best left to another time. 

6. Third bullet, "...rescind Flint's obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting,...". The state gave the 
city $2.1 million to help the water system during the summer, and part of the agreement to get the $6 million 
from the legislature for the emergency was contingent on Flint contributing a share. 

7. Fourth paragraph, "...for the state's failures is an abdication of clear responsibility.,..". First of all, it's not a 
state's failures, it is a perhaps avoidable mistake made with the corrosives that was unacceptable to us, the 
Director and Governor are taking actions to fix the problems, the health and wellness of the people of Flint is 
our absolute concern, and it's not an abdication of dear responsibility. The "...state-appointed emergency 
manager was in charge..." may well be accurate for the physical change, but the decision to leave the Detroit 
system was made when the city, the Mayor, the council, the county, local leaders and the KWA. was devised and 
that was well before the physical change. 

For these reasons and others, I'd prefer Sara's general assistance and aid comments and not responding to the letter.

Hi Sara: 

I've attached a copy of a letter Congressman Kildee sent to Gov. Snyder last week concerning Flint water 
issues. 

I didn't know if there has been a formal reply and/or if you would want to comment on it.

Subject: Updated MDHHS talking points, data 

Attached you will find a copy of our talking points as well as tables that outline our data on blood lead testing in children 
in Flint before and after the change in Flint's water. 

While the chart is a bit cluttered with the different colored lines representing different years, in the bullet point 
narrative, you can see that our experts state that if the elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in 
water, we would expect the dark blue line to stay high rather than follow the seasonal pattern. 

Thank you, 

Geralyn

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 


• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

• All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 

• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 



WIC Children 


• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water. 



Blood Lead Testing of Children in Flint, Before and After the Change in Flint's Water 


The change in Flint's water source occurred in 
April 2014. MDHHS looked at children's blood 
lead levels (BLL) before and after this event. 

The dark blue line (May 2014 - April 2015) and 
the green line (May-August 2015) reflect 
children's blood lead tests after the change. All 
other lines reflect tests before the change. 

An increase in childhood lead poisoning in 
summer (July, August, September) is typical 
throughout Michigan every year. 

While there is a dramatic difference between the 
numbers of elevated BLL in the summer before 
and after the event, a wider look that includes 
data back to 2010 shows that the year BEFORE 
the event (the yellow line) was more of an 
anomaly than the year after (the dark blue line). 

If elevated BLL were being driven by the change 
in water, we would expect the dark blue line to 
stay high rather than follow the seasonal 
pattern. 

All data included in this analysis were reported 
by laboratories directly to MDHHS, in 
accordance with State law.

Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Secretary Burweli, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich., have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, I am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 
particularly for young children. 


Although the city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have 
conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 
level, there are significant questions about the efficacy of their testing. In fact, Dr. Marc Edwards 
of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water In Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 



Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Introducing Makayla* 



• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last 
week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns. 

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west 
side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with 
warm tap water. 

• Physical exam and development are normal. Makayla 
receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine lead and 
hemoglobin screening. 

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/dL. 


^Hypothetical scenario 


Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL... 


Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are considered 
elevated blood lead levels (EBL) 

Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead level 

Disproportionately impacts low income, minority 
children 

Primary prevention is most important 



Primary Prevention 


• "Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear 
to be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental 
and housing policies should encourage 
PREVENTION of all exposure to lead " 


"Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention " 2012 
CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. 



What will happen to Makayla? 


• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

- Decrease in IQ 

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

- Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low IQs 
(<70) 

• Implications for special education services, employment, 
incarceration, life achievement, etc

— ADHD behaviors 

— Delinquent behaviors and arrests 

— Total arrests and increased rates of arrests 
involving violent offenses 

— Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular, 
immunologic, endocrine, etc

The Cost 


"For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as well 
as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) in 
lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure." 


"The present value of Michigan's economic losses attributable to lead 
exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. 
blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per 
year in loss of future lifetime earnings."

Lead in Water 


• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in controlling 
other sources. 

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in water 
sources, disinfectant uses, etc 

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable 
formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers 

— For about 25% o f infants drinking formula made from tap water at 10 
ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5 
micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL). 

- Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights

Preliminary Results 



Conclusions from BLL analysis 


% of children with EBL in Flint has increased 

— Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water 
lead levels 

Results underestimate risk: infants not screened 
for lead and water usage unknown. 

— Accurate exposure largely unknown since national 
childhood lead screening focuses on household lead 
exposure (paint, soil, dust) at later ages (1 and 2 yrs) 


Results are consistent and concerning. Primary 
prevention has failed. 



Next Steps 


Immediately limit further exposure 

— Encourage breast feeding 

— No tap water for high risk groups: infants on formula & 
pregnant mothers 

— Declare health advisory: allows WIC to administer water or 
ready-to-feed formula and other resources (Salvation Army 
& United Way water supplies) 

— Distribution of lead clearing NSF-approved filters 

— Public education regarding precautions (flushing, etc) 

— Re-connect to Lake Huron water source ASAP 



And Makayla 


Asymptomatic now 

But what will her future hold 
and an entire generation of 
Flint children?

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 


This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

conference on campus, SUMfT. Snyder is a far right politician who has imposed dictatorial Emergency 
Managers and Emergency Financial Managers on majority- poor- Brack communities and school districts 
in Michigan including Flint . Benton Harbor, Pontiac, Detroit, and others, in Flint. Snyder's Emergency 
Manager switched the water supply from Detroit water to Flint water in April 2014 leading to a public 
health crisis in which city water was contaminated with up to 6 times the allowable level of lead. 

Snyder's brand of "innovation” and "relentless positive action" means destroying the common good in

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 

As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 


i 



Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
conducted, visit www.mjchigan.gov/flintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at knsztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.”

www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 
assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 
provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 

As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water 
testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling 
results from Freeman Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even 
individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools 
and other buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. 
“Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing 
fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the 
state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty- 
two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high 
results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or 
plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for 
several minutes, lead levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, 
systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and 
fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized 
flushing regimen. The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing 
period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, 
so we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related 




components where high lead levels were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. 
“Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the 
water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our 
students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have 
access to safe, clean drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling 
was conducted, visit www.michiqan.gov/flintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will 
soon be available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the 
Flint Community Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools 
and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michiqan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took 
advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 
percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and 
more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead 
service lines or in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make 
it difficult for homeowners and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all 
residents can do is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable 
information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1 , 
or by emailing flintwater@citvofflint.com . 

For more information about water samples received through the state’s free testing program, 
visit www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and 
Regulatory Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain 
a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of 
plumbing materials are used. The assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the 
school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified 
faucets and fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, 
followed by a 30-second flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then 
the fourth sample. These samples provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or 
around each specific faucet and fountain as well as its connecting plumbing. 



On Oct. 31 , the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 1 0 each from three sites in the 
school. These 1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the 
impact of any lead sources deep in the building’s plumbing.

Subject: Information about Flint blood lead level testing results release 

Good evening Governor and team, 

We're working with the Department of Health and Human Services on its 
release of blood lead level testing results, with some continuing 
discussions about messaging and timing. I've attached the draft press 
release, an informational graphic and talking points. 

This is a challenging situation to be sure, but I think these results are fairly 
encouraging considering some of the heated rhetoric on this issue. We are 
discussing a "people first" approach to messaging, and perhaps issuing 
early next week rather than on at 9:30 a.m. on a Friday so it doesn't look 
like we are burying news. 

In a nutshell: 

■ Blood lead level testing results released today revealed that 24 of 963 
adults and children tested in Flint in October had elevated levels, 
according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 


l 



■ MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department 

to reach out to families testing with higher levels and help them reduce 
their exposure to lead sources. 

■ Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 963 

children and adults between October 1 and October 30. Eighteen 
people age 17 or younger had elevated blood lead levels. Six adults 
over the age 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

■ The testing and follow-up work is part of our action plan.

DRAFT (517)241-2112 


MDHHS releases October data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Results show 24 of 963 people tested had elevated levels 

LANSING, Mich. - Blood lead level testing results released today revealed that 24 of 963 adults 
and children tested in Flint in October had elevated levels, according to the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to reach out to families 
testing with higher levels and help them reduce their exposure to lead sources. 

Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 963 children and adults between 
October 1 and October 30. Eighteen people age 17 or younger had elevated blood lead levels. Six 
adults over the age 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The report is intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and 
provide cumulative total numbers. 

“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, chief 
medical executive with the MDHHS. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those 
with elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with county 
health department to reach these families. We will update these numbers on a regular basis and 
remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of 
elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary 
and venous blood tests. People who have had multiple tests are counted only once. The full 
report is posted online at www.michigan.gov/flintwater and will be updated as more data 
becomes available. 


The testing is part of the state’s action plan to address health concerns related to Flint’s water 
infrastructure. 


Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letter to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
GCHD nursing staff are conducting direct outreach to families when an elevated blood lead level 
has been detected, serving as an important resources by addressing questions and concerns, 
providing information, and meeting them in their home environment. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations including the MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
November 18, 2015 


Blood Lead Level Testing Results 

• The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is releasing a report regarding 
blood lead levels in Flint children and adults in zip codes 48501-48507. 

• The purpose of the report is to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in 
Flint and provides cumulative total numbers. 

• It is not intended to be a technical report but a technical description, and further 
analysis of the data in the report is underway. 

• The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number 
of elevated blood lead levels >5pg/dL (micrograms per deciliter), broken down by date 
and age ranges. 

o Specifically, the current report breaks down the data by the 16 months prior to 
the switch in water source for Flint (January 1, 2013 through April 14, 2014), to 
the 17 months after the switch (April 15, 2014 through September 30, 2015), and 
after the lead exposure prevention campaign was initiated by the State in Flint 
October 1, 2015 to October 30, 2015. These numbers will continue to be 
updated. 

o The report also breaks down the number of tests and elevated blood lead levels 
by children younger than 6, children ages 6-17, and adults 18 years and older. 

■ Lead exposure for children younger than 6 is of particular concern 

because they are more sensitive to the effects of lead and tend to absorb 
more than older children and adults. 

• Data in the report includes both capillary and venous blood tests. People who have had 
multiple tests are counted only once. 

• 963 people were tested in Flint between October 1, 2015, and October 30, 2015, 18 
children 17 years of age or younger had elevated blood lead levels. Six adults over the 
age of 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels during this time as well. 

• With these testing results, MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health 
Department to conduct case management to ensure that these families are receiving 
the follow up care they need - including additional blood testing and a home 
investigation to identify and help reduce the potential for additional lead exposure in 
their environment. 

• In addition to this report, MDHHS has zip code level data available by quarter for 48503- 
48507 by request. Zip codes 48501-48502 do have some cases, but the numbers are too 
small to release by quarter.

Water Filters and Replacement Filters 


• Our first action item is to work closely with our public and private partners to provide 
water filters to Flint residents and MDHHS clients. 

• To meet this priority, the governor identified one million dollars in state funding to 
purchase water filters for Flint residents. 

• The Brita SAFF-100 filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the 
NSF/ANSI 53 standards for drinking water treatment units. 

• The Brita faucet filtration system we are distributing are National Sanitation Foundation 
certified to reduce lead in drinking water. 

• Free water filters and replacement cartridges are available to current Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services clients and Flint residents who are on the 
Flint water system at four locations: 

o Flint residents who are not current MDHHS clients should visit one of two 
Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices to obtain a 
filter. 

■ at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint 

o Current MDHHS clients in the city of Flint should visit their local MDHHS office: 

■ At 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 

• Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to 
distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

• Given the questions and concerns regarding the change in water source in Flint, MDHHS 
authorized the use of emergency services funding to provide water filters for MDHHS 
clients receiving assistance in the city of Flint. 

• This funding will support active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food Assistance 
Program (FAP), Child Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance (SDA), 
State Disability Assistance (SDA), or Social Security Insurance (SSI) recipients so that they 
can obtain filters that are National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) certified to remove lead 
and ANSI Standard 53. 

• MDHHS has also posted an instructional video on the MDHHS YouTube channel to help 
residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
filter when it expires. 

o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plsOvmH 0 

• MDHHS currently serves approximately 25,000 households in Flint. 

Background Information 

• Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels of children in Flint have 
followed an expected seasonal trend; due to small numbers further analysis was 
initiated. 


2 



• While this analysis of blood lead levels in Flint as a whole remains true, after a 
comprehensive and detailed review down to the zip code level, we have found that the 
state analysis is consistent with that presented by Hurley. 

• Director Lyon is working closely with DEQ and the administration to take active steps to 
reduce all potential lead exposures in Flint and across the state. 

• Our Chief Medical Executive has been in communication with the lead investigator at 
Hurley Children's Hospital, and we continue to work with Hurley, the city of Flint, local 
and state leaders to verify and analyze data trends. 

• Zip code-level data does show that there has been an increase in elevated childhood 
blood lead levels in specific communities. 

o This does not conclusively mean that the water source change is the sole cause 
of the increase, but data does show an association. 

o There is an increased proportion of children with elevated blood levels in several 
zip codes, particularly 03 and 04. These appear to have increased over the last 
1.5 years. 

o Lead exposure can occur from a number of different sources (such as paint, 
gasoline, solder, and consumer products) and through different pathways (such 
as air, food, water, dust, and soil). 

o Although there are several exposure sources, lead-based paint is still the most 
widespread and dangerous high-dose source of lead exposure for young children 
in the US and Michigan. 

• We reviewed MDHHS statewide data using the same methodology used by Hurley, 
looking at our numbers by zip code and age ranges, and filtering out non-Flint children. 

• Routine surveillance of blood lead levels does not analyze data down to the zip code 
level. Detailed analysis like this occurs when there is reason to focus in on precise 
locations or populations. 

• MDHHS is working closely with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 
Hurley Children's Hospital, the Genesee County Health Department, and community 
organizations to initiate further action steps. 

• We understand that cost may be a barrier to following the recommendations for 
drinking water, which is why NSF-certified filters are being distributed to residents on 
the Flint water system free of charge. 

• MDHHS is recommending that residents follow the Public Health Advisory issued by the 
Genesee County Health Department, as well as take further steps to reduce exposures 
to all forms of lead in and around their homes. 

MDHHS Stats and Facts 

• 'High Risk' Zip codes (48503 and 48504) 


3 



o Blood lead level rates among children under six years of age in the high risk zip 
codes (48503, 48504) were 2.7 times higher than the rest of Genesee County 
before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o After the switch to Flint River Water, rates in the high risk Zip codes were 3.2 
times that of the rest of Genesee County. 

• Other Zip codes in Flint 

o Rates of elevated blood lead levels among children under six years of age in 
other parts of the city of Flint were 2 times that of the rest of Genesee County 
before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o The magnitude of the elevated rate remained roughly the same during the 
period after the water source switch. 

• Lead abatement through MDHHS was federally funded up until FY14 when Michigan 
began providing additional funds to abate homes. 

• In FY14, $1.25M General Fund was added. In FY15, General Fund was bumped up to 
$1.75M and FY16, General Fund remains at $1.75M. 

Reducing and Removing Lead Exposure 

• Use only cold filtered water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby 
formula. Hot water is more likely to contain higher levels of lead. The lead in household 
water usually comes from the service line that connects your house to the water main 
or the plumbing in your house, not from the local water supply. 

• In housing built before 1978, it can be assumed that the paint has lead unless tests show 
otherwise. 

• Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces 
painted with lead-based paint. 

• Children and pregnant women should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is 
undergoing renovation. They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or 
in cleaning up paint debris after work is completed. 

• Create barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean- 
up is completed, you should clean and isolate all sources of lead. 

o Close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on 
walls. You can also apply temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, 
to cover holes in walls or to block children's access to other sources of lead. 

• Regularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated 
from household dust or exterior soil. Both can be lead sources. 

• Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust 
is a major source of lead, you should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces 
every 2-3 weeks. 


4 



o Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be 
kept clean. If feasible, windows should be kept shut to prevent abrasion of 
painted surfaces or opened from the top sash. 

• Take off shoes when entering the house to prevent bringing lead-contaminated soil in 
from outside. 

• Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. 
Plant grass on areas of bare soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, 
if possible. 

o Until the bare soil is covered, move play areas away from bare soil and away 
from the sides of the house. If you have a sandbox, cover the box when not in 
use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. That will help protect children 
from exposure to animal waste. 

• Avoid using makeup, containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or 
liquids that are not shown to be lead-free. 

• Remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children. 

• Shower and change clothes after finishing a task that involves working with lead-based 
products such as stained glass, making bullets, or using a firing range. 

If possible, shower and change before returning home if your job requires you to work with or 
around lead. These jobs can include painting, plumbing, and some factory work. 

WIC Children 

• There are 855 infants participating in WIC in Flint. 

• We are working with partners at the United Way to ensure that WIC families have 
access to water filters and bottled water. 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source documenting unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to 
receive ready-to-feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household will be considered on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 

Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote public health and 
protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they relate to reducing 
lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is more work that must be done to 
ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and 
Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health Department, local schools, and our partners 
in the non-profit community. 

These partners are making progress, and we know we can always strive to improve practices and communication for 
continual improvement. 

You make a solid suggestion about establishing a person who is independent of any one of the involved state agencies or 
organizations to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am recommending that Harvey Hollins, 
director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the issue and the challenges 
faced by our cities and will be effective in this role. He will be assisted by senior members of our executive team to 
ensure you will have the continued support and cooperation that you need. We also have retained Chris DeWitt, a 
veteran communications specialist, to strengthen community outreach efforts to make sure residents have access to the 
information they need. 

I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more accessible to the 
Flint community. These are critical measures that can be used as we look the challenges and progress in Flint, but also 
can be a part of efforts moving forward in other areas of our state. It's important that people have confidence that we 
are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to improve interaction among city, state and 
federal agencies. We also will continue to work with the medical community to consider how we can work together on 
wraparound needs of children who might experience health problems. 


l 



People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the water coming out of 
their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - at all levels - is working effectively to 
protect them. 

I thank you again for investing your time and expertise to this vitally important effort. 

Regards,

I totally agree with going so far as to specifically apologize. I also like Rich's 
suggestions. The statement should convey three main points: 1 ) very sorry with no 
excuses 2) open and transparent 3) urgency in action steps going forward. 


I think this statement accomplishes those goals.

This is the best narrative I have seen that actually describes how we feel about the 
situation and our resolve to make things right. A few thoughts: 


We might think about a "lead in" to your second para in the statement. Something 
like "The bi-partisan taskforce has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee 
County, State and Federal officials and complete an independent fact based 
analysis. They have reviewed hundreds of documents at all levels of government 
and from the public health science community and continue to do so. 


Para 3 might unintentionally suggest that there are public health stakeholders who 
are not as serious as the governor. This may be an overreach, but may I suggest 


"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for 
error in testing for lead and other toxins. I understand there can be disagreements 
within the scientific community. That is why I have directed my Directors of MDEQ 
and DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on the Flint water issue 
to the state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should be 
able to affirm that every testing protocol and conclusion validates that Flint citizens 
will have safe drinking water, and that we are doing everything possible to ensure 
proper monitoring and remediation of blood levels and physical or neurological 
impacts over the long term. And I want the Flint community and all citizens of 
Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has happened." 


Nick and Dan might not like the "invite" but I spoken with them both and they of 
course will support whatever the Boss decides. 


Thanks, 



Rich

Colleagues: 


Many of us have reached the conclusion that our messaging on the Flint water 
crisis has room for improvement. We haven’t conveyed to citizens the depth of 
our concern over the situation. I’ve crafted a statement to be made by the 
Governor, and would like you to review it. 


This statement is meant to manage expectations on the timing of concrete 
conclusions (the task force report may not come out for another month at least) 
and to signal that action may come sooner than that (we plan to reach out to 
Mayor Weaver, for example, and perhaps hold a press conference with her in 
January announcing some next steps). 


Here is the statement: 


“I’ve been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water 
situation and I’ve read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the 
processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 


“No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent 
this crisis. I want Michigan to be the state that is known for the safest water in the 
nation. 

“I’d like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing 
investigation. As they uncover more facts, it’s clear to me we can do better. The 
report may take another month or so, but if we need to make changes more 



swiftly, I plan to take immediate action. 


“The bottom line is we’ll take responsibility for our part in Flint’s water crisis. I’m 
committed to partnering with all of the stakeholders who are as concerned about 
public health as I am. I vow to make sure that Flint citizens will have safe drinking 
water. And I’m so very sorry that this happened. 


“But I know an apology isn’t enough. We’ve already allocated $10 million to test 
the water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we’re going to sit down in the next week to 
discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 


“What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure residents there that we 
will work hard to make things right.” 


Thank you, 
Meegan

Subject: Attached Letter from Flint Water Advisory Task Force 

Dear Governor: 


The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, 
has devoted considerable time and effort to our review of the contamination of the 
Flint Water supply. Our focus has been on assessing what happened, why it 
happened, and what is needed to prevent any recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also, as you know, been assessing on-going mitigation efforts. 

Attached is a letter reporting our finding as to who bears the primary 
responsibility for what happened in Flint. We are sending this letter now because 


l 




it has become clear to us that ascribing responsibility and ensuring accountability 
is both critical and urgent, and simply cannot wait for our final report. 

Establishing responsibility and accountability is the first step in re-establishing the 
trust between the citizens of Flint and their government and the agencies whose 
responsibility it is to protect their health. The current level of distrust also serves 
to compromise the effective delivery of protected services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. 

Thank you for the support you have given us and your demonstrated commitment 
to respond to our findings and recommendations. 

On behalf of the Task Force

December 29, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 



This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 
this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 

A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 


2 



legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 


We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 
time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 

We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDFIFIS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community. 

Respectfully yours.

Subject: Flint Water 

I thought this was a good example of something we could do to restore confidence in Flint. We have a ton of water 
experts in Michigan. Maybe we should adopt different testing protocols if our university experts say it's a good idea or 
that the federal guidelines are no long best practice. Going above and beyond seems like a good idea to be given 
everything that has happened.

Re: Attached Letter from Flint Water Advisory Task Force 


Thanks for forwarding this. I didn't realize that Dan's resignation was on the table. I know it was probably 
necessary from a public perception standpoint, but it is a terrible shame. He's probably the best department 
head we had and it seems pretty clear he was given bad information for a period of time. That's the danger in 
managing a department of technical professions. You have to trust your people. In this case, it cost kids their 
health and a good man's reputation. I hope that employees who actually did wrong will be terminated, rather 
than just transferred to different areas of the state. 

I found it interesting that two of the chief outside critics came to Dan's defense in their interviews with the 
Detroit news.

That tells me that outsiders know who the real culprits are. Hopefully we have the tools to root out the 
problems.

Subject: Attached Letter from Flint Water Advisory Task 
Force 

Dear Governor: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on 
October 21, 2015, has devoted considerable time and effort to our 
review of the contamination of the Flint Water supply. Our focus 
has been on assessing what happened, why it happened, and what 
is needed to prevent any recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in the 
state. We have also, as you know, been assessing on-going 
mitigation efforts. 

Attached is a letter reporting our finding as to who bears the 
primary responsibility for what happened in Flint. We are sending 
this letter now because it has become clear to us that ascribing 
responsibility and ensuring accountability is both critical and 
urgent, and simply cannot wait for our final report. Establishing 
responsibility and accountability is the first step in re-establishing 
the trust between the citizens of Flint and their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. The 
current level of distrust also serves to compromise the effective 
delivery of protected services designed to address ongoing public 
health issues. 

Thank you for the support you have given us and your 
demonstrated commitment to respond to our findings and 
recommendations. 

On behalf of the Task Force

Generally looks good. We should proceed assuming three items that 
should be addressed: 

1. Next steps, point 3 is in the first person. It should be edited to be 
consistent. 

2. Budget request - eliminate the lead abatement line items in both 
budgets for now if we are also sending this item. We need to have a 
more through review of this issue of proposing lead abatement in 
individual private residences. 

3. What is the timing of getting the EO done? Is the Comms plan to go 
with this approach ready?

Team, 

Here is background on the planned Tuesday event in Flint regarding the $2 million Distressed Cities grant and other 
issues connected to the water issue. 

There are plans for two press releases on Tuesday. The first will detail the two Flint grants and will be released by the 
governor's communications office. The other release, which would detail the other grants, would follow from Treasury 
with a quote from the governor. 

Mayor Walling has agreed to speak at the event, with Harvey Hollins and Dan Wyant representing the governor's office. 
Sen. Ananich has asked to speak, and it has been suggested that Rep. Neeley would speak and it might be better to add 
him to the program. Others, such as Deputy Director Workman and Emergency Manager Ambrose, would be present 
and available. 

The attached document includes details about the planned event, as well as background on the grants from Treasury 
and on the entire water issue from DEQ as well as Mayor Walling's Facebook post about the governor and links to the 
stories in the media about the issue. 

We have a room reserved and are working with the communications team in Flint to have microphones and other items 
needed for the event. 

Please let me know if there is any information you think should also be included, or anything that should be changed. 
Once everyone has had the opportunity to review, we can forward to the governor. 

Thank you, everyone, for your assistance. I know there are lots of moving pieces and many people involved.

Flint water almost like 'gas chambers for Jews/ says 
Sharpton group activist 


Ron Fonger | rfonqerI@mS8ve.com By Ron Fonger | rfqnqerl@rrt88vss.eom The Flint Journal 
on March 03, 2015 at 12:54 PM, updated March 03, 2015 at 2:10 PM 


The Rev. Charles Williams II speaks during a press conference for the National Action Network's coordinated response to 


the Trayvon Martin verdict in this 2013 Flint Journal file photo. Flint Journal file photo 


FLINT — The president of the Michigan chapter of Al Sharpton's National Action Network says Flint 
water is "almost as bad as gas chambers for Jews." 

The Rev. Charles Williams II, speaking at a news conference and water giveaway in Flint on Monday, 
March 3, made the comment, which appeared on television station WEYI-TV. 

The city of Flint issued a statement saying officials are "extremely disappointed" by the pastor's 
remarks, including his comparison of consumption of Flint's water to "genocide." 


l 



"We are extremely disappointed in Rev. Charles Williams' comments but certainly understand -- and 
share — his frustration," the city statement says. "With that said, we find Rev. Williams' accusations 
are a gross misrepresentation of the Flint water condition and a wholly inappropriate comparison." 

When contacted by The Flint Journal-MLive for comment today, Williams referred a reporter to his 
Twitter page. 

Steven C. Low, executive director of the Flint Jewish Federation, called Williams' comments "an 
inappropriate invocation of the Holocaust" that "diminishes what survivors went through." 

"Drawing such a comparison doesn't shed any light on the water problems," said Low, who called on 
Williams to apologize for his remarks. 

The news conference Williams spoke at is one of several that have been held since Flint notified 
customers in January that the city is in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of the level 
of total trihalomethanes (TTHM) in water tested during the last 10 months. 

Outspoken residents have since protested the price, color, odor and overall quality of the water. 

City officials have said Flint water is safe for the vast majority of the people to drink but warned in 
January notices that TTHM can pose increased health risks for those with a compromised immune 
system, the elderly, pregnant women and infants. 

Testing during the last two months has shown the city is meeting all health and safety standards 
for water, and a consultant is expected to deliver a report this week, detailing recommendations for 
improving the quality of drinking water here. 

Flint's water problems, including multiple boil water advisories last summer, bloomed after the city 
began using the Flint River as its drinking water source in April. 

Prior to that switch, the city had used Lake Huron water, pre-treated and purchased from the city of 
Detroit. 

The Flint statement says "some people may still have issues with discoloration, or do not like the taste 
of the (higher) mineral content river water (but) these do not amount to a safety issue." 


2 



Williams responded to a request for comment with a text message to The Journal, saying "quote my 

Twitter feed.” 

In a Twitter message, the pastor wrote, "I (hear) #flint city officials upset at my comparisons 
yesterday. They should use their anger 2 make sure resident aren't drinking death water." 

In another message, Williams wrote, "Isn't it extreme to knowingly sell residents contaminated water 
people in #flint forced to buy liver disease water? What is that? #Genocide." 

In addition to his work as president of NAN-Michigan, Williams is the pastor of King Solomon Baptist 
Church of Detroit. 

This week was not Williams' first appearance in the spotlight in Flint. 

In 2013, he demanded Hurley Medical Center officials answer charges that they granted a father's 
request that only white nurses care for his infant child. 

The hospital eventually agreed to pay nearly $200,000 in total to three black nurses who sued the 
hospital after claiming they were discriminated against when they weren't allowed to treat that white 
baby. 

NAN describes itself as one of the leading civil rights organizations in the nation with chapters 
throughout the United States. The organization was founded in 1991 by Sharpton.

RE: request for comment 


The governor believes everyone in Michigan deserves dean, safe drinking water. It is why Michigan 
has a great team of professionals at the DEQ to oversee municipal drinking water operators around 
the state and make sure they comply with state and federal drinking water standards. And it is worth 
noting that, today, the city's drinking water system is producing water that meets state and federal 
standards. 

More alarming than the councilman’s incendiary and inaccurate remarks is the underexamined fact 
that the city has failed to properly maintain its drinking water system for the past 40 years, and the 
impact of that system-wide neglect is starting to show in ways big and small. When the city council 
votes to return to Detroit, as a water supply, it makes a strong statement: they are committed to 
continuing to spend money they don’t have while continuing to ignore the real problem - simple 
maintenance of the pipelines. 

For its part, The State of Michigan will continue working with city leaders to establish a schedule for 
necessary fixes and long-term solutions that align with Flint’s major needs and available dollars. The 
problem with the city's water supply did not happen overnight, and a real fix won’t happen overnight, 
either. 

I think my RPA is in my other sportcoat. Going to look for it now. ...

considered news and whether he will actually include a definition of what genocide is to people will 
know what he’s actually accusing us of. He needs to start holding people accountable for their actions, 
rather than just cutting and pasting from Facebook. 


That said, here’s my RPA response, trying to point out that this is a long-standing city problem, and 
we are helping. I definitely don’t want to go point for point with these guys. Think this works?

It's unfortunate that the councilman used such inflammatory rhetoric. The governor believes Flint, 
residents need and deserve safe, clean water. The state continues working with city leaders to help 
with their water infrastructure challenges, which were years in the making. That assistance includes 
$2 million in grants to help with leaks and other issues, which will allow the city to prioritize its 
repairs and help residents more quickly.

Still working through the near-literacy of the post itself, and laughing too hard to be meaningfully offended by the 
myriad factual errors and brazen political grab. 

Notice the new media trend? Someone says something ridiculous, dumb or just inflammatory and it gets not only 
covered in the news pages but also the editorial department?? Ron is a good reporter who just sent you a note saying a 
group of journalism professionals met this morning and decided, consciously, to make news out of a flatly nutty 
Facebook post. 

That is how I quit laughing at this. 

Let me know if you need fact bullets or something. I'll do whatever you need done. 

Thanks,

Hey Dave: 

Just came out of our morning meeting and we've decided to write about the most recent Facebook 
comments of Flint Councilman Wantwaz Davis (who is also a candidate for mayor). 

The comments are similar to those made last month by the president of the Michigan chapter of Al 
Sharpton’s National Action Network, who said Flint water is "almost as bad as gas chambers for 
Jews." (We spoke out against those comments editorially after covering it as a news story) 

Here is Davis' unedited comment, which includes his contention that the governor and 
emergency manager are “creating an obvious genocide against the residents of Flint.” 

Thanks.

Warsfwag Davis 


It has become apparent to me that the emergency manager and Governor Rick Snyder is creating 
an obvious genocide against the residents in Flint, Michigan, who are forced to drink the 
contaminated, unhealthy water, that is going to commit an imminent danger to the lives of those who 
have a compromised immune system, and infants who biologically doesn't have a fully developed 
immune system. When ! become mayor, I will certainly make the governor and all who took part in 
continuing to have the residents in Flint, Michigan exposed to this injustice and inexcusable danger 
accountable; this cannot carry on without someone becoming accountable and or responsible; it is 
so unfair that people in the future may contract a disease that will carry through the duration of their 
lives. The emergency manager is choosing finances and fixture of infrastructure, i.e., old pipes that 
hasn't been worked on for the past 60 to 70 years over lives and welfare of innocent civilians. 
Someone has to be charged with this neglect and imposition of danger amongst a helpless people; 
ail of this is the effects of bad leadership. I must reiterate and can never say it enough, when I 
become mayor, which will be the best leader and or Chief administrator the City Of Flint, Michigan 
has ever chose. I will fight hard, not only against the unjust conditions we have long suffered from, 
but will make someone accountable for this genocide and address these unfortunate conditions 
around the nation and beg for the assistance of the Department of Justice ( United States Attorney 
General's office) to do a through investigation, so in the end, if any one contracts a disease in the 
future, I would attempt to have them charged and brought to justice, including a civil suit, in the 
federal courts; someone has to be punished for the ills of the residents of Flint, Michigan. In 
conclusion, please vote August 4, 2015, for Wantwaz Davis for Mayor. Bad leadership and decision 
making has to come to an end at some point and time, and that will certainly be the day I am sworn 
in as your new mayor and Chief Administrator. This is a picture of reminder that in the past summer, 

I conducted 4 protest against the contaminated water and high water bills, I was teliing people about 
the unhealthy water, before any notices came out to the public, attempting to keep these issues at 
the forefront, as mayor I will continue to fight even harder, these issues will not die until justice is 
brought to the people and someone is charged for this imminent genocide.

Revised 5/1/12 


Fact Sheet 
City of Flint 
DWSD versus KWA 

Issue: City of Flint joining Karegnondi Water Authority and leaving City of Detroit water 

system 

Fact: Both the City of Flint and City of Detroit operate their water system via enterprise funds. 

The water fund does not impact either community’s general fund. Leaving the water 
system will not impact the general fund. 

Fact: The City of Flint is a suburban customer of Detroit. If Flint leaves, it only impacts the 

suburban customer rate, not Detroit’s. 

Fact: Detroit’s own plan calls for (latest available estimate) $ 1 .2 billion dollar improvements 

to supply redundancy to Flint. If Flint leaves, Detroit avoids this construction cost. 

Fact: Detroit and DWSD have experienced bond rating decreases in recent months. If Flint 

leaves, DWSD avoids a new bond issue and eliminates a capital project from its master 
plan improving its financial outlook. 

Fact: Delivering water to Flint from DWSD is expensive. If Flint leaves, DWSD can reduce 

its operating and maintenance costs to its contracted customers. 

Fact: DWSD has a limited capacity for water treatment and delivery. If Flint leaves, the City 

can resell that volume to other customers. 

Fact: DWSD has multiple drinking water treatment plants. Some are more expensive to 

operate and maintain than others. Without a commitment to Flint, its largest customer 
other than the City of Detroit, DWSD may choose to discontinue operation of one or 
more of its current facilities and realize significant cost reductions to the overall system. 

Fact: Flint is not part of the DWSD sewer system. The City of Flint leaving has no impact on 

the sewer system. 

Fact: The creation of tire KWA system will create over 1,000 construction jobs in Michigan. 

Design and construction of the system will take 42 months from July 2012 through 
December 2015. 

Fact: KWA is offering a fixed rate for capital to its customers. Flint joining KWA will give 

the City a stable rate for upwards of 20 years. 

Fact: KWA will offer raw water to the region. Raw water is not enhanced with chemicals, 

which is undesirable to agribusiness. 

Fact: The 1-69 corridor/I-75 corridor crosses in Flint. Along with CN and CSX and the 

pipeline aerotropolis, Flint can be a major transportation center for agribusiness. KWA 
can provide two products for agribusiness: potable and process (raw) water, and 
wastewater treatment facilities. 



Revised 5/1/12 


Fact: 


Fact:

Fact: 


Fact: 


DWSD does not serve the Thumb region. KWA with its partners will be able to serve 
both the population with its basic needs: drinJdng water and the businesses with large 
quantities of process (raw) water. 

DWSD is the only water supplier for over 4 million residents of the state. The creation 
of the KWA will create a second water supply system thereby reducing the impact of 
terrorist attacks on water supplies. With a mutual aid agreement between DWSD and 
KWA, the system could complement each other. 

DWSD does not provide water supply to major portions of the KWA service area. 
KWA will provide local municipalities in the thumb region with an alternative water 
supply to the Arsenic impacted well systems. 

In addition, local communities can replace groundwater systems with KWA surface 
water system and thereby improve local groundwater levels. 

The KWA system will provide fire protection service to regions currently not served. 

The current DWSD water system has over 20% water loss in its system. KWA’s water 
supply is expected to have less than a 5% water loss. KWA will provide a more 
effective use of the waters of the state. 

KWA provides redundant water supply to Flint. Currently, DWSD only provides a 
single source to Flint. KWA provides multiple supply sources to Flint at a fraction of 
the cost. 


KWA has offered to purchase excess infrastructure from DWSD. If Flint leaves, Detroit 
has 25 miles of watermain it no longer needs. KWA has offered to purchase the pipeline 
and enter into a long-term arrangement for purchase of water from DWSD. 

Each incorporating municipality in KWA will pay the same rate for raw water; therefore, 
each community will set its own treatment standards and exert local control of the cost 
of water it provides to its citizens. 

Lapeer and Sanilac Counties are facing depletion of their groundwater supplies. 



C r © & te cl ^ / 1 /-jI 0 1. S 

Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) Fact Sheet 

• KWA is incorporated by the State of Michigan, comprised of the City of Flint, City of 
Lapeer, Genesee County, Lapeer County, and Sanilac County. 

• As specified in its Articles of Incorporation, each of these constituent municipalities has one 
representative to the board - specifically the Mayors or their designees of the 2 cities (Flint 
and Lapeer), the Drain Commissioners or their designees from each of the counties (Sanilac, 
Lapeer, and Genesee). 

• KWA will deliver raw water to customer utilities. 

• Each governmental unit will still own and operate their respective treatment and distribution 
systems. GCDC will have no jurisdiction over the City of Flint water. Flint will have all 
franchise rights for sale and treatment of water from KWA within the City of Flint. 

® Each community that obligates itself to the debt for construction of the KWA infrastructure 
pipeline, intake and pump stations, receives commensurate voting membership to the board. 

• Flint’s debt obligation is based on the volume as selected by the city. 

• Additional members are appointed by their respective communities. 

• All board members serve without compensation. 

» KWA will operate with 5 to 7 full-time equivalent employees. KWA will contract its labor 
force. 

• To date, only the City of Flint and Genesee County have bought capacity in the project. 

® Once KWA water is available, each community receiving untreated Lake Huron water from 
KWA will pay a share of the operating costs, he.: electricity, labor, maintenance, and 
chemicals in proportion to the volume of water they receive. 



KWA has created a capacity of 60 million gallons per day (mg). 


Created 9/1/2015 


• Flint has purchased 18.0 mgd. Genesee County has purchased 42 mgd. Each purchaser 
pays based on their purchased capacity. The total project cost will be divided by 60 (total 
capacity) and each purchaser, Flint and Genesee, will pay the same price per unit. 

• The operation and maintenance cost will also be charged based upon the volume purchased 
annually. 

• If a community exceeds capacity, it must either purchase or rent capacity from a community 
with excess. 

• There exists a 30 day rolling average, which will determine if any community exceeds 
purchased capacity. Water volume purchased for capacity purposes will be calculated on 
the basis of a 30-day average. 

o Capital costs for Flint will be a flat rate of approximately $6.8 million over 30 years. 

• To date, KWA is below its construction cost projection of $274 million. 

• 90 percent of the KWA pipeline route is constructed along public right of ways. 

• Any land required, that was outside the road right-of-way, was purchased from the original 
land owners, not a 3 rd party short-term owner. 

• All KWA construction contracts have been publically and competitively bid. 

• No tax dollars, (Federal, State, or Local) are being used to fund this project. All project 
costs for KWA are being paid by the Flint and Genesee County water users.

Attached you will find a copy of our talking points as well as tables that outline our data on blood lead 
testing in children in Flint before and after the change in Flint's water. 

While the chart is a bit cluttered with the different colored lines representing different years, in the 
bullet point narrative, you can see that our experts state that if the elevated blood lead levels were 
being driven by the change in water, we would expect the dark blue line to stay high rather than follow 
the seasonal pattern. 

Thank you,

Flint Water Issue - Rep. Kildee Letter Received By Federal Agencies 

09-22-15 Kildee Requesting Temporary Assistance for Lead in Flint Water.pdf; Flint Pediatric 

Lead Concerns REVISED.PDF 


Importance: High 


Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. Fie and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Introducing Makayla* 



• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last 
week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns. 

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west 
side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with 
warm tap water. 

• Physical exam and development are normal. Makayla 
receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine lead and 
hemoglobin screening. 

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/dL. 


^Hypothetical scenario 


Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL... 


Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are considered 
elevated blood lead levels (EBL) 

Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead level 

Disproportionately impacts low income, minority 
children 

Primary prevention is most important 



Primary Prevention 


• "Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear 
to be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental 
and housing policies should encourage 
PREVENTION of all exposure to lead " 


"Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention " 2012 
CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. 



What will happen to Makayla? 


• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

- Decrease in IQ 

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

- Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low IQs 
(<70) 

• Implications for special education services, employment, 
incarceration, life achievement, etc

pooled analysis. Environ Health Perspect, 2005. 113:894-9.

retardation and cardiovascular diseases from environmental lead 
exposure. Environmental Research, 2004. 94:120-33. 



Behavioral Burden 


Increased likelihood of : 

— ADHD behaviors 

— Delinquent behaviors and arrests 

— Total arrests and increased rates of arrests 
involving violent offenses 

— Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular, 
immunologic, endocrine, etc

adulthood. PLoS Med 5(5): elOl

The Cost 


"For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as well 
as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) in 
lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure." 


"The present value of Michigan's economic losses attributable to lead 
exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. 
blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per 
year in loss of future lifetime earnings."

Lead in Water 


• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in controlling 
other sources. 

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in water 
sources, disinfectant uses, etc 

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable 
formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers 

— For about 25% o f infants drinking formula made from tap water at 10 
ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5 
micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL). 

- Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights

lead in children. Journal of Water and Health, doi: 10.2166/wh. 2013. 067 58-68 (2014). 

Edwards, M. Fetal Death and Reduced Birth Rates Associated with Exposure to Lead-Contaminated Drinking Water. Env. Sci. and Tech. 2013 DOI: 
10.1021/es4034952 



Preliminary Results 



Conclusions from BLL analysis 


% of children with EBL in Flint has increased 

— Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water 
lead levels 

Results underestimate risk: infants not screened 
for lead and water usage unknown. 

— Accurate exposure largely unknown since national 
childhood lead screening focuses on household lead 
exposure (paint, soil, dust) at later ages (1 and 2 yrs) 


Results are consistent and concerning. Primary 
prevention has failed. 



Next Steps 


Immediately limit further exposure 

— Encourage breast feeding 

— No tap water for high risk groups: infants on formula & 
pregnant mothers 

— Declare health advisory: allows WIC to administer water or 
ready-to-feed formula and other resources (Salvation Army 
& United Way water supplies) 

— Distribution of lead clearing NSF-approved filters 

— Public education regarding precautions (flushing, etc) 

— Re-connect to Lake Huron water source ASAP 



And Makayla 


Asymptomatic now 

But what will her future hold 
and an entire generation of 
Flint children?

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Introducing Makayla* 



• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last 
week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns. 

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west 
side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with 
warm tap water. 

• Physical exam and development are normal. Makayla 
receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine lead and 
hemoglobin screening. 

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/dL. 


^Hypothetical scenario 


Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL... 


Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are considered 
elevated blood lead levels (EBL) 

Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead level 

Disproportionately impacts low income, minority 
children 

Primary prevention is most important 



Primary Prevention 


• "Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear 
to be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental 
and housing policies should encourage 
PREVENTION of all exposure to lead " 


"Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention " 2012 
CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. 



What will happen to Makayla? 


• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

- Decrease in IQ 

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

- Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low IQs 
(<70) 

• Implications for special education services, employment, 
incarceration, life achievement, etc

pooled analysis. Environ Health Perspect, 2005. 113:894-9.

retardation and cardiovascular diseases from environmental lead 
exposure. Environmental Research, 2004. 94:120-33. 



Behavioral Burden 


Increased likelihood of : 

— ADHD behaviors 

— Delinquent behaviors and arrests 

— Total arrests and increased rates of arrests 
involving violent offenses 

— Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular, 
immunologic, endocrine, etc

adulthood. PLoS Med 5(5): elOl

The Cost 


"For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as well 
as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) in 
lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure." 


"The present value of Michigan's economic losses attributable to lead 
exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. 
blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per 
year in loss of future lifetime earnings."

Lead in Water 


• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in controlling 
other sources. 

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in water 
sources, disinfectant uses, etc 

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable 
formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers 

— For about 25% o f infants drinking formula made from tap water at 10 
ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5 
micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL). 

- Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights 


Triantafyllidou, S., Gallagher. D. and Edwards, M. Assessing risk with increasingly stringent public health goals: the case of water lead and blood 
lead in children. Journal of Water and Health, doi: 10.2166/wh. 2013. 067 58-68 (2014). 

Edwards, M. Fetal Death and Reduced Birth Rates Associated with Exposure to Lead-Contaminated Drinking Water. Env. Sci. and Tech. 2013 DOI: 
10.1021/es4034952 



Preliminary Results 



Conclusions from BLL analysis 


% of children with EBL in Flint has increased 

— Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water 
lead levels 

Results underestimate risk: infants not screened 
for lead and water usage unknown. 

— Accurate exposure largely unknown since national 
childhood lead screening focuses on household lead 
exposure (paint, soil, dust) at later ages (1 and 2 yrs) 


Results are consistent and concerning. Primary 
prevention has failed. 



Next Steps 


Immediately limit further exposure 

— Encourage breast feeding 

— No tap water for high risk groups: infants on formula & 
pregnant mothers 

— Declare health advisory: allows WIC to administer water or 
ready-to-feed formula and other resources (Salvation Army 
& United Way water supplies) 

— Distribution of lead clearing NSF-approved filters 

— Public education regarding precautions (flushing, etc) 

— Re-connect to Lake Huron water source ASAP 



And Makayla 


Asymptomatic now 

But what will her future hold 
and an entire generation of 
Flint children?

DHHS just advised me there have been discussions with Nick Lyon and the Governor's Office on this issue. DHHS also 
advised me that DEQwas involved and DHHS would probably be the Public Health Advisor in Flint this week ... not sure 
exactly what that will mean. 


F/Lt Covey spoke to Jen Boyer, the Genesee County EM, and reported the following: 


- This is the first she has heard about the Kildee letter, 

- She mentioned that a year ago she was aware of a letter that was written to Governor Snyder. 

- To her knowledge, the water In Flint is still meeting ERA. standards. 

- She mentioned that the infrastructure (including residential homes) is old and may be part of the problem, not just 
because water is from the Flint River. 

- She believes the city could connect to the county system if needed. 

- The city is supposed to be connecting to a new pipeline from Port Huron in the spring of 2016 which will provide a 
solution, but the city infrastructure will still require repair. 

- She reported The Detroit water system knew Flint would one day connect to this new pipeline, so they raised rates 
50%. 

Tomorrow Tony Katarsky will speak with our mitigation offices on potential use of 4195 (SE Mi disaster) mitigation funds 
and if they could be used to assist with infrastructure fixes. There is a 25% local match to the federal funds. 

Attached is the FEMA response to Rep. Kildee. He may not get it for a couple of days but I toid FEMA 1 wanted a copy 
and It just came through. Piease hold it within the Governor's Office and this group for situational awareness so we do 
not get ahead of FEMA, FEMA advised him that local or private sector resources would be more expedient and practical.

Many thanks, Chris. 

There have been a LOT of conversations and work (and history) on this issue, primarily with both DEO. and DHHS lately, 
and Treasury previously. Sounds like you definitely got a large part of status update and lay of the land. 

Let's touch base tomorrow and can fill you in further. And any insight on any potential use of mitigation funds would be 

incredibly helpful. We'll make sure to keep MSP EMHSD in loop with other state agencies too moving forward as this 

issue and infrastructure challenge isn't going away anytime soon. 

Thanks again,

Subject: City of Flint-Water Issue Update 

The latest from Lt Roach... 

The County Flealth Department is expecting to receive 4,000 filters sometime 
tonight. The filters were secured through the United Way and are being trucked 
in (cost appox $80,000). Lt Roach was unable to determine where they are being 
brought in from. They are hoping to get $40,000 more in donations to buy 
more. The Health Department plans to distribute filters tomorrow at 1 :00 pm at 
UM Flint. The recipients will also be taught how to use filters. Lt Roach was 
told there are approximately 15,000 homes in the city of Flint with corrosive 
distribution pipes. The city water department has a list of the homes with details, 
but information is on paper index cards, not in a database or spreadsheet. They 
would have to manually sort through cards, so this approach is not practical. The 
current plan is to distribute filters by priorities being similar to those used during 
H1N1: pregnant women, women breast feeding/bottle feeding, residences with 
and children under 5 years. All must be City of Flint residents; credentials will be 


l 


checked to make sure they are residents and qualify. A WIC list may be utilized 
along with a current list of residences on the lead program The Health 
Department hopes to accomplish work with 15-20 employees and possibly 
another 20 volunteers. They plan to distribute using two car lanes to avoid having 
recipients exit cars. 

No state resources have been requested.

Importance: High 

Attached is the draft release we would like to issue ASAP regarding the new plan for water filter distribution in the city 
of Flint. 

At a meeting with multiple community partners today, our local MDHHS office realized they could do distribution from 
the 2 Flint offices as long as the local community action agency could assist them in storing the larger quantities of 
filters. 

Locally, the groups will be issuing a press release from the local health department discussing distribution, but we feel it 
is important to also send this from MDHHS. 

We are happy to discuss this with Ron Fonger if you want him to be the first press call we make once we issue it.

DIRECTOR 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

October 5, 2015 (517) 241-2112 

Water filters available for MDHHS clients in Flint beginning Tuesday 

LANSING, Mich. - Free water filters will be available to current Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services clients and Flint residents at four locations beginning Tuesday, October 6, at 
9 a.m. through a partnership between the MDHHS and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. Free National Sanitation Foundation certified water filters are being 
provided to Flint residents as part of the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing 
water concerns in the area. 

Current MDHHS clients are encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office location to obtain a free, certified home water filter. Residents who are not 
currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should visit the Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices located at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. 
Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

“Ensuring that families in the Flint area have access to resources that will help reduce the potential 
for lead exposure is our top priority,” said Nick Lyon, director of the MDHHS. “I want to thank 
our partners who have mobilized to make water filters available - a point that highlights the 
importance of continued collaboration at the local, state and federal level as we move forward.” 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food 
Assistance Program (FAP), Child Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance 
(SDA), or Social Security Insurance (SSI) recipients should bring valid identification and a copy of 
their water bill to their local MDHHS office to receive their filter free of charge. Flint residents 
who are not active MDHHS clients should bring identification and their water bill to the GCCARD 
location. 

Although blood lead levels throughout the city of Flint have remained steady, last week, MDHHS 
data was found to be consistent with a recent Hurley Children’s Hospital study indicating 
increased blood lead levels in children residing in two Flint ZIP codes after a 2014 change in water 
source. While lead paint remains the number one cause of lead poisoning in Michigan, the recent 
data prompted MDHHS to take action to reduce potential lead exposures through water sources. 

MDHHS is urging parents in Flint and throughout the state to do their part in preventing elevated 
blood lead levels in children. For more information about steps you can take now, visit 
www .michi gap . gov/lead , or contact your local health department. For updates on Flint water and 
available resources, visit www.michigan.g.gov/i'lint.water .

residents also should be entitled to a water filter and although the press release is about DHHS clients, we don't want to 
create additional confusion, A throw-away line about the other residents might be wise.

RE: Release on Flint 


Thanks, Chief. 


That is correct - anyone who is a DHHS client AND anyone who is a Flint resident will receive a water filter. 

They are trying to direct clients to go to DHHS office, ail other residents to the local Community Action Agency locations 
- though either can go to the other respective locations and walk out the door with a filter by using the same 
form/policy to ensure "no wrong door" and make as easy as possible. But they are trying to direct folks accordingly. 
Outlined in iede and 2 nd graph - will have them change headline to help with ciarity further. 

DHHS is still working on some of those first issues/Qs (shut ins, disabilities, etc) - working locally to get those 
components further refined. Active group including Area Agency on Aging, Co. Emergency Services, etc working on. 
Original plans for seniors was to see if Meals on Wheels volunteers could deliver and install but apparently interferes 
and would cause too much of a delay with delivery of hot food.

Subject: Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update - FOIA EXEMPT AND 
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED 

The Flint Drinking Water Action Plan was announced on October 2, 201 5. It included 
the following: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately 

• Offered free water testing to Flint residents 

• Provided free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state 
assistance programs 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes 

• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

• Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint drinking water public health advisor 

• Boosted a comprehensive lead education program 

Testing in Flint Public Schools Immediately 

Samples were taken on October 2 and were received at DEQ laboratory over the 
weekend. Test results to date indicate 37 samples tested, 4 of which exceeded a 
federal action level, and 1 of those 4 was a significant outlier. We will be compiling 
detailed information about which schools and area codes the test results came from and 
will be providing that information in our next update. 

We have met with DHFIS, and we are working on developing response protocols, a 
communications plan, and guidance for schools when this data is reported. 

Offered Free Water Testing to Flint Residents 

i 



We have received 4 sets of samples from Flint that represent individual residents. We 
will be compiling the total number and the results of those samples and reporting in a 
future report. 

Provided Free Water Filters to Residents with Concerns or Who are Included in State 
Assistance Programs 


DHHS held organizational meetings in Flint on October 5, and filter distribution by 
DHHS started on October 6. Nick Lyon in DHHS is taking the lead in filter distribution. 

Expanding Health Exposure Testing of Individual Homes 

Dr. Wells and Dan Wyant have been in conversations about a protocol for exposure 
testing. Dr. Wells will take the lead on developing the protocol. 

Accelerating Corrosion Controls in the Flint Drinking Water System 


A conference call was held with U.S. EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman 
and national corrosion control experts. We asked two questions: 

1 . Which is a safer water source - DWSD or Flint River? 

2. If you don’t have an opinion on the safer source, what criteria should we 
use for an evaluation? 

EPA staff would not commit to a preference, but their evaluation of the criteria 
clearly lead to the conclusion that DWSD was a safer water source. EPA 
committed to submitting technical assistance to the Safe Drinking Water 
Technical Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) meeting, which will be held 
on October 7 at 2:00 p.m. in Flint City Hall. 

DEQ met with the Flint Mayor, the city manager, and their water staff. Flint agreed 
to expediting corrosion controls. We discussed the agenda for the Advisory 
Committee meeting. The Advisory Committee will be asked to evaluate two 
respective water sources at their Wednesday meeting. 

We expect the Advisory Committee to recommend the water source that would 
address not only lead safety but also other water safety issues. 

Accelerating Water System Improvements to Address Replacing Lead Service Lines 

Conversations with Congressman Kildee and EPA have clarified the state would be 
allowed to use Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds to replace private drinking water 
service lines. Senator Ananich has been approached to introduce language clarifying 
the state’s authority. 

Expediting the Completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority Pipeline 

Dan Wyant has talked to Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright. Mr. Wright 
has provided a list of issues that would help expedite the completion of the Karegnondi 


2 




Water Authority pipeline. They include truck weight and frost law exemptions, talent 
identification, and expediting permits. 

Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

EPA has appointed their national technical expert to the Advisory Committee, and we 
have appointed Alfred Franzblau, M.D., Professor of Environmental Health Services, 
University of Michigan, to the Advisory Committee. 

Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor 


Boosted a Comprehensive Lead Education Program 


Other Updates 

• Dan Wyant was interviewed on October 6 by CBS Evening News during filter 
distribution in Flint. Questions asked were: 

o Was it a mistake to go to Flint River water? 

Answer: We draw water from the surface waters; we treat it to safe 
drinking water standards. At issue is lead exposure. Lead exposure must 
be addressed. Actions are being taken to address the issue, 
o Did you put kids at risk? 

Answer: Lead exposure is a serious issue, and steps need to be taken to 
limit lead exposure, 
o Why did it take so long? 

Answer: DEQ has been there from the beginning addressing the issue of 
Flint water. Recent tests justify and require the actions taken. Action 
steps address short-term, intermediate, and long-term lead issues to 
ensure public safety and confidence of the drinking water. 

• Dan Wyant also spoke to the Governor about Flint funding needs. A meeting is 
scheduled for October 7 at 8:00 a.m. to further discuss proposals. 


• What we are telling Flint citizens is: 
o Have your water tested 

o Use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and preparing formula 
o Run water before use if it has not been used for several hours 
o Obtain a water filter approved for lead removal 
o Purchase lead-free plumbing components 
o Remove entire lead service lines

Subject: Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update - FOIA EXEMPT AND 
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED 

The Flint Drinking Water Action Plan was announced on October 2, 201 5. It included 
the following: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately 

• Offered free water testing to Flint residents 

• Provided free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state 
assistance programs 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes 

• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

• Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint drinking water public health advisor 

• Boosted a comprehensive lead education program 

Testing in Flint Public Schools Immediately 


Samples were taken on October 2 and were received at DEQ laboratory over the 
weekend. Test results to date indicate 37 samples tested, 4 of which exceeded a 
federal action level, and 1 of those 4 was a significant outlier. We will be compiling 


i 



detailed information about which schools and area codes the test results came from and 
will be providing that information in our next update. 

We have met with DHHS, and we are working on developing response protocols, a 
communications plan, and guidance for schools when this data is reported. 

Offered Free Water Testing to Flint Residents 


We have received 4 sets of samples from Flint that represent individual residents. We 
will be compiling the total number and the results of those samples and reporting in a 
future report. 

Provided Free Water Filters to Residents with Concerns or Who are Included in State 
Assistance Programs 


DHHS held organizational meetings in Flint on October 5, and filter distribution by 
DHHS started on October 6. Nick Lyon in DHHS is taking the lead in filter distribution. 

Expanding Health Exposure Testing of Individual Homes 

Dr. Wells and Dan Wyant have been in conversations about a protocol for exposure 
testing. Dr. Wells will take the lead on developing the protocol. 

Accelerating Corrosion Controls in the Flint Drinking Water System 


A conference call was held with U.S. EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman 
and national corrosion control experts. We asked two questions: 

1 Which is a safer water source - DWSD or Flint River? 

2. If you don’t have an opinion on the safer source, what criteria should we 
use for an evaluation? 

EPA staff would not commit to a preference, but their evaluation of the criteria 
clearly lead to the conclusion that DWSD was a safer water source. EPA 
committed to submitting technical assistance to the Safe Drinking Water 
Technical Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) meeting, which will be held 
on October 7 at 2:00 p.m. in Flint City Hall. 

DEQ met with the Flint Mayor, the city manager, and their water staff. Flint agreed 
to expediting corrosion controls. We discussed the agenda for the Advisory 
Committee meeting. The Advisory Committee will be asked to evaluate two 
respective water sources at their Wednesday meeting. 

We expect the Advisory Committee to recommend the water source that would 
address not only lead safety but also other water safety issues.

There were some rumors going around today (with an apparent FB recording of a Brita rep) and being reported by

filters being provided ARE NSF certified for lead reduction. 

They are working on a statement to share for our review and then to share immediately afterward before this gets any

State of Michigan 

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

Lansing

DIRECTOR 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

October 7, 2015 (517)241-2112 

State offering extended, weekend hours for water filter distribution at Lippincott GCCARD 

Nearly 5, 000 NSF certified filters issued by MDHHS to Flint residents since Monday 

LANSING, Mich. - Flint residents and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 
clients with a city of Flint water bill will now be able to take advantage of extended hours this 
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department 
2727 Lippincott location. Extended hours will be offered at the Lippincott facility only, and will 
run until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The other three 
locations will maintain 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. operating hours, Monday through Friday, for filter pick up. 

Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive, reemphasized that the Brita SAFF-100 
filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the NSF/ANSI 53 standards for 
drinking water treatment units. 

“The Brita faucet filtration system that we are distributing to residents are National Sanitation 
Foundation certified to reduce lead in drinking water,” said Dr. Eden Wells. “When connected 
appropriately, these filters improve water quality by filtering out contaminates including lead, 
chlorine, benzene and other chemicals.” 

Since Monday when MDHHS announced that free water filters would be distributed at four Flint 
locations, the state and GCCARD have partnered to issue approximately 5,000 free NSF certified 
water filters to residents that are on the city of Flint water system. The distribution of filters is part 
of the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing water concerns in the area. These 
NSF certified water filters remove lead in the water administered through water taps in homes. 

MDHHS clients and residents with a city of Flint water bill may take advantage of the extended 
hours at the Lippincott GCCARD. During the regular business hours, MDHHS clients are 
encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office location; 
residents on Flint water who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should 
visit the GCCARD offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw. Staff will be onsite at all 
four locations to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active recipients should bring valid identification and a 
copy of their water bill to their local MDHHS office. Flint residents who are not active MDHHS 
clients should bring identification and their city of Flint water bill to a GCCARD location. 

MDHHS is urging all residents do their part to prevent elevated blood lead levels in children. For 
more information prevention, visit www. michi gan, gov/lead, or contact your local health 
department. For updates on Flint water and resources, visit www.michigan.gov/flintwater .

There were some rumors going around today (with an apparent FB recording of a Brita 
rep) and being reported by media that the filters may not be properly certified to handle 
lead. DHHS' toxicology lab has again confirmed that the filters being provided ARE NSF 
certified for lead reduction. 


They are working on a statement to share for our review and then to share immediately 
afterward before this gets any further out of control. 


Dave - please note in particular since you're with the Governor. Hopefully will be well 
cleared up by that time, but just in case.

Please review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint. This incorporates some suggested edits to 
the strong draft from DEQ earlier today. 

Thank you very much. 

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water 
Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint 
water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint’s 
Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 
million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 


i 


“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping the city on its 
water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health 
protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. 

I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the 
dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large 
bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff 
issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully 
optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from 
leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines 
or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 
Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and 
plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on 
Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office 
locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the 
Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in 
Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the 
water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing 
baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 
total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level 
of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled 
water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free 
testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at 

michiqan.gov/filntwater .

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping

I think this looks good but are we missing an opportunity to shout out all the entities that have stepped 
up to help? GM, Home Depot, etc. etc.? 

If Harvey has the full list, perhaps it could even be attached as an addendum. The point is that a lot of 
people did come together to address the problem, including the private sector and various volunteer 
organizations. I think it says something special about this state rallying to help one of its cities.

Team, 


Please review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint. This 
incorporates some suggested edits to the strong draft from DEQ earlier today. 

Thank you very much. 


Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit 
water provides best protection for public 

health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund 

switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting 
with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, 
Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a 
portion of the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint 
city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation 
donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of 
Environmental Quality today also committed an additional $3.5 million for water 
filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, 
and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in 
drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a 
Wednesday meeting of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the 


2 



Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month 
until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical 
experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for 
children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to 
solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the 
Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public 
health benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to 
fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can be 
present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has 
already fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the 
insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s 
problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in 
Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some 
households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead 
pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue 
to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including 
continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate 
information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 
4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, 
free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will 
be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, 
including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on 
Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the 
cold water tap and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, 
only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in 
schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples 
spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is 
committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. 


3 



Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and 
filtration as a precaution to protect children. 


In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including 
daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes

said. 


******* although KWA is referenced later, the opening implies that this is a permanent switch and that 
KWA will be substandard to GLWA********

"The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems 
from large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. 
Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already frilly optimized its corrosion 
control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching 
into the water. "

*****thi S is a good statement and true as long as all municipalities get there water from the Great Lakes. 
If not, are we saying that there are other communities that do not have optimum drinking water? ***** 

Best,

Department of Environmental Quality today also committed an 
additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional 
staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking 
water.

Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water

Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the 
Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. 
“The technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all 
agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides 
the best public health protection for children and families. This 
effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a 
problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, 
the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all 
parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, 
carries many public health benefits. As large bodies of water, the 
Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain 
events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower 
rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already 
fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat 
the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging 
infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated 
with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some 
households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water 
until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local 
authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information 
about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. 
Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County 
Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 
Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four 
locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to 
distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about 
proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this 
weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include 
turning on the cold water tap and running the water until it’s as 
cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation 
planned

The state today also released the first results from its lead 
screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples 
taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the 
state is committing to further testing water and inspecting 
plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a 
precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, 
including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available 
for any Flint resident.

results, is available at www.mich^

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 
million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million 
and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation donating $4 million.

MDP Statement: Those Responsible for Flint Water Crisis Must Be Held 

Accountable 


LANSING - The Michigan Democratic Party issued the following statement today, on behalf of Party 
Chair Brandon Dillon, demanding those responsible for the Flint water crisis be held accountable and 
calling on Governor Snyder to immediately fire former Flint EM, and current EM for Detroit Public Schools, 
Darnell Earley: 


“Accountability in government means answering to the people you serve, not just cleaning up your 
mistakes using their money,” said Brandon Dillon, Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. 

“This catastrophe began with the governor’s appointed emergency manager, and as much as Governor 
Snyder would like to pretend, this is not a matter of negotiating at the boardroom table. This is a 
situation where you pay for your mistakes and put those responsible on the chopping block. 


“That is why we are calling for the immediate firing of the governor’s handpicked emergency manager 
for Flint, Darnell Earley. Earley was in charge when the decision was made to switch the city to unsafe 
drinking water. If poisoning children wasn’t bad enough, after Earley failed the citizens of Flint, the 
governor inexplicably rewarded him with another appointment - emergency manager for Detroit Public 
Schools - where he is now responsible for the education of nearly 50,000 students. 

“The children of Flint and Detroit are being robbed of what most of us take for granted - safe drinking 
water and a quality education. The wholesale theft of our children’s futures must end now. That begins 
with the removal from power all those that would sacrifice the future of a single child in Michigan - let 
alone thousands - in order to add a few extra dollars to the bottom line.”

So, you don't want to say that the Governor doesn't believe he wants to execute his power under the constitution 
to remove the Mayor and Council of Flint, the Chair of the County Board of Commissioners and the Drain 
Commissioner since they ultimately brought this change to bear without proper understanding of the issues, and 
since they had previously approved the use of the Flint River to supplement the Genesee County system... I'm 
only being half facetious taking this tack...

Documentl 

Documentl.docx 


Regarding Phelps FOIA and proposed lawsuit, here are some things to know (Maggie, please jump in 
if I’ve got any of this wrong): 

1 . He filed on Sept. 4, and included a $50 personal check with a request focused on “waivers, 
permits or applications to use the Flint River as a drinking water source.” 

We didn’t have anything recent that matches that description. The river has been the city’s 
emergency backup for years, so they didn’t need a new formal approval, just approval of 
construction permits for the plant to begin serving as the primary water production source. We 
had some 2007 guidance documents we sent the city, and we shared those, but ultimately, 
there wasn’t much that matched his request. We responded piecemeal, on Sept. 22 and 25, 
with communications that we did not have records in Executive or Drinking Water division that 
matched his query. Our formal, final response came Sept. 30 th , denying the FOIA for lack of 
matching records (bit of a goof as we’d already sent the 2007 guidance docs, but ... ). 

2. Maggie Datema called Phelps - to let him know he didn’t need to FOIA us, he could just ask 
and we’d supply whatever he wanted; to inform him we’d cancelled his check and were 
sending it back; and that we’d be happy to help him get whatever information he was seeking, 
as well as a meeting to better understand the program. Phelps reportedly told Maggie he 
needed to consult his attorney and he’d get back to us. He never did. 

3. Datema has called his office three times. No callback. 

4. The enclosed DRAFT communication will be completed and sent from Maggie to the 
representative today. 

Let me know what else you need. Thanks, 
b.

Dear Representative Phelps 


I apologize that recent attempts to connect with you via phone have not been 
successful. As I mentioned in our last phone conversation, I want to make sure you are 
provided complete access to the DEQ’s records and files to get answers to any question 
you have on Flint, or any other DEQ program. 

When the Department sent back your personal check included with your Sept. 4 
Freedom of Information Act request, it was because all state agencies make a practice 
of working directly with the state’s elected leaders to produce information and answer 
questions. The documentation we sent to you on Sept. 30 was the best available 
response to your query, based on the wording of the request for “waivers, permits or 
applications to use the Flint River as a source for water or drinking water ...” The 
subsequent communication from the DEQ FOIA officer was that office’s procedural 
closing of the loop. 

We would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you, more clearly explain the DEQ’s 
Drinking Water Program policies and requirements, and help you develop questions or 
requests for information we can respond to. You have our standing commitment to 
provide you with whatever information we have to help you in your role as a community 
leader. 

Please contact my office at the number below and we will arrange a meeting at any time 
that works for you. 

Sincerely, 

Maggie Datema 

Deputy Director, 


DEQ

For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Reconnects to Detroit Water 


Flint, Michigan - October 16, 2015 ~ Flint has reconnected to Detroit water, reached an agreement with the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) for the temporary provision of treated Lake Huron water to 
Flint. Work to establish the reconnection will begin immediately in a coordinated effort between the City of 
Flint, Genesee County and the DWSD. 

A tremendous effort by all three partners, along with the efforts of the Governor and the State Legislature, 
ensured that this action occurred as quickly as possible. “The money from the state to begin fixing Flint water 
by reconnecting to Detroit is just a start - a down payment,' said Mayor Dayne Walling. “I am not going to stop 
until every drop of drinking water in Flint is 100% safe.” 

Detroit water will be introduced into the Flint system throughout the evening. It is expected that the thorough 
replacement from Flint River water to Detroit water will happen after approximately three weeks. Residents in 
Flint may see discoloration as well as noticing some taste and odor issues during the transition. 

Water provided by DWSD will contain corrosion control agents to hinder the leaching of lead from old pipes 
into the water; however, the City will also be adding additional corrosion control agents to further minimize the 
risk presented by lead pipes. 

The contract between the City and DWSD calls for the provision of 12.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of 
treated water from Lake Huron at a cost of $ 1 . 1 million per month. DW SD Director Sue McCormick noted that 
the talks between Flint, DWSD and the GLWA Board were very cordial: “everyone acted in a spirt of 
cooperation in order to come to this agreement.” Flint will purchase water from Detroit until the Karegnondi 


l 



Water Authority (KWA) pipeline can be completed in 2016. At that time, the KWA will become the primary 
water source for the City and the Flint River will remain as a backup system. 

Residents with questions or concerns about the hydrant flushing in their area can call the Water Service Center 
at 810-766-7202. Continuing information on water will be provided via the City of Flint’s website,

The contract between the City and DWSD calls for the provision of 12.5 million gallons 
per day (mgd) of treated water from Lake Huron at a cost of $1 .1 million per month. DWSD 
Director Sue McCormick noted that the talks between Flint, DWSD and the GLWA Board 
were very cordial: “everyone acted in a spirt of cooperation in order to come to this 
agreement.” Flint will purchase water from Detroit until the Karegnondi Water Authority 
(KWA) pipeline can be completed in 201 6. At that time, the KWA will become the primary 
water source for the City and the Flint River will remain as a backup system. 

Residents with questions or concerns about the hydrant flushing in their area can call the 
Water Service Center at 810-766-7202. Continuing information on water will be provided 
via the City of Flint’s website, cityofflint.com.

All, 

Need your review of this document. It’s our response to Detroit News story they’re prepping for 
tomorrow. 

Per Sara, Dan will call Jarrod shortly to discuss what we’re proposing to do here. 

Thanks,

Brad 


After reviewing the emails made available through FOIA, there are several things that seem to need 
addressing. 

1. It appears DEQ staffers have essentially downplayed or ignored warning signs from EPA's water 
expert, Miguel Deltoral. We have been aware of Mr. Deltoral's unofficial memo that went public 
in April. But his email dated two months earlier on Feb. 27, to Jennifer Crooks and Mike Prysby, 
he seems to lay out exactly what's come to pass... 

"(Particulate lead readings) Folks tend to discount these values as anomalies, but particulate lead 
release is a normal part of the corrosion process and it is universal (common) in all systems. It's just 
that it's not captured as often by the infrequent LCR sampling. If systems are pre-flushing the tap 
the night before collecting LCR compliance samples (MDEQ) still provides these instructions to 
public water systems) this clears particulate lead out of the plumbing and biases the results low by 
eliminating the highest lead values. If systems are pre-flushing and still finding particulate lead, the 
amount of particulate lead in the system can be higher than what is being detected using these 
"pre-flushed" first-draw samples. 

"My point on that was that people are exposed to the particulate lead on a daily basis, but the 
particulate lead is being flushed away before collecting compliance samples which provides false 
assurance to residents about the true lead levels in the water." 

Miguel goes on to address the optimal corrosion control situation in that same Feb 27 email. 

"If I remember correctly, Detroit is feeding (phosphate) for the lead/copper rule, but since Flint 
is no longer part of that interconnection, I was wondering what their OCCT was. They are 
required to have OCCT in place which is why I was asking what they were using." 

So what I'm seeing here is Miguel having raised these issues as far back as February. When 
unofficial April memo shows up, it's clear these issues still haven't been addressed. 

Another email from the day before came from Jennifer Crooks at EPA which also highlights early 
concern about a lack of proper corrosion controls as well as the testing methods. 

"The City can't just flush in advance of taking the compliance samples, they have to flush the 
lines on a regular basis." 

Can you respond to the fact that it appears the state ignored or disregarded several warnings 
from EPA officials about testing deficiencies and insufficient corrosion controls? 

Emails offer snapshots of a much broader conversation. The program staff did not ignore the 
information. They believed they were handling the situation in full accordance with federal 
protocols, and contacted EPA Region 5 officials promptly to seek guidance. They were more 
than halfway done with compliance sampling under the federal protocol and the 90 th percentile 
samples to that point showed 6 pbb - barely in excess of the 5 pbb threshold. 



2. Corrosion control, or the lack thereof, seems to be another major problem here. At the first of 
the recent press conferences, Dan Wyant said that lime was being used as a corrosion control 
method. But that is clearly contradicted by DEQ staff at several points. One of those is Pat 
Cook's email from April 24. 

"Flint is currently not practicing corrosion control treatment at the (water treatment plant)." 

This puts Dan's comments about the lime into question. 

There's been some confusion on this point, and I think it was addressed in our previous 
response. This was a misunderstanding with technical staff. Lime was added to soften the water. 
While it adjusts pH and can have some impact on corrosivity, it was insufficient corrosion 
control. 

3. I gather from several exchanges in here that EPA and DEQ disagree over that the state's 
responsibility was in ensuring there was optimal corrosion control. One of the emails from July 
includes notes from a meeting of all the parties shows that EPA was asking why that hadn't been 
used from the outset, and the state's response was something along these lines: 

""MDEQ explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a "new system," but 
as a new source. It is their understanding that two rounds of 6-month testing is still needed to 
characterize the water quality. They don't know what optimized is until those two rounds of six month 
monitoring are completed." 

Under the lead copper rule, was the state required to have phosphate treatment in place? It appears 
here that the state chose to interpret the CLR as not requiring corrosion control. That seems like a highly 
dubious conclusion. 

And after concerns were raised repeatedly beginning (at least as early as February), why was nothing 
done? 

What has become clear in recent weeks is that staff believed they were handling the situation in 
accordance with the proper protocol for a water provider using a new source, but the federal Lead and 
Copper rule has a particular provision for communities over 50,000 people; that the system operator 
must continue treating with full corrosion control even as they test the water. 

What the staff did would have been the proper protocol for a community under 50,000 people. None of 
the DEQ staff in this division had ever worked on a water source switch for a community over 50,000 
people - it's uncommon for our big communities to switch sources. 

it's increasingly clear there was confusion here, but it also is increasingly clear that DEQ staff believed 
they were using the proper federal protocol and they were not. 

The Governor will soon announce an independent, third party, after-action review to detail what 
happened and why, and offer steps to make sure Michigan's drinking water program is on a better 
course in the future. 

4. Another area of concern, one I mentioned on the phone, is the pace of response. And I 
understand that the lead copper rule lays out response times. But you have concerns being 
raised about lead by an EPA expert as far back as February. The state's response, in several 
instances, is that federal guidelines give us two six-month periods to collect samples, and then 
more time to submit an action plan, and then a year or more to enact that plan. 

While those delays in making a change may be permitted under the law, given that we're talking 
about a possible public health crisis, why wasn't there more expediency? The responses in these 



emails appear to be without any sense of urgency at a time when Flint residents may have been 
drinking dangerous water. 

The results of two rounds of water testing showed the city needed to move to optimizing its 
corrosion control. That order was issued Aug. 17. 

5. At many points along the way, serious concerns are made about the state's testing methods. 
The Virginia Tech results were not the first time someone had indicated state testing - as 
approved by federal guidelines - might not be giving accurate readings. 

Miguel's April memo reads: "I wanted to follow up on this because Flint has essentially 
not been using any corrosion control treatment since April 30, 2014 and they have (lead 
service lines). Given the very high lead levels found at one home and the pre-flushing 
happening in Flint, I'm worried that the whole town may have much higher lead levels 
than the compliance results indicated, since they are using pre-flushing ahead of their 
compliance sampling." 

There is substantial controversy over the lead and copper rule - the ERA has been working for years on 
ways to update it, and Michigan will be an active part of that conversation going forward. The situation 
in Flint is a snapshot of an issue affecting cities around the state and the nation. More than a dozen 
states use the sampling protocol Michigan uses - that's not a defense of the protocol, but rather an 
indication that even experts on the issue disagree about the most effective testing methods. 

What everyone can agree on is that lead is a serious issue. And I think everyone can agree that when the 
state came to recognize that there could be a health threat in the city, we took appropriate action. We 
are now engaged in an unprecedented effort to protect kids and families in Flint, develop more 
knowledge about what has happened and how people were affected, and take steps to make sure it 
doesn't happen again - in Michigan, or anywhere else. 

All the people who brought this issue forward deserve credit for bringing it to us. Our actions reflected 
inexperience, and our public response to criticism was the wrong tone early in this conversation. But the 
best we can do with the situation going forward is represented in our present course - the Governor's 
plan represents all the suggestions outlined in the draft EPA memo, the Virginia Tech report, and the 
guidance we've gotten from EPA. 

We will learn from this. We will make necessary changes to see to it that our program becomes a 
national leader in protection.

I was at a City Council meeting last night when Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson said the state has only wired 
Flint $2 million of the $6 million approved by the state Legislature. 

She said the city has been told it will receive an additional $2 million in January and another $2 million in April. 
Henderson said she's asked that the money be sent immediately because the city was required to pay Detroit the entire 
$12 million upfront, before the water was reconnected, and its water and sewer fund balance has dropped significantly 
as a result. 

Several council members also spoke about this, and Council President Josh Freeman called the payment plant "beyond

Guys, what's your availability for a quick call to go over the LARA, piece in more detail? Below is language that can be 
used as part of a larger message on the state's efforts. 


• On October 16 th , LARA and DEQ staff met with Flint Community Schools officials. LARA staff then 
began a review of building plans and permits in order to assess the building plumbing in all 13 Flint 
Public School buildings. 

• The assessment allows LARA staff to identify plumbing components of concerns and prioritize sample 
sites within each building. 

• On October 23 rd , LARA staff will begin to identify of all faucets, taps and outlets that are used regularly 
by students and staff for drinking and cooking. 

• After the sites and order of collection have been determined by LARA staff within a building, state 
officials can begin to take samples.

« The initial agreement and understanding was for rnonthly payments. 

® Unbeknownst to the state, the city entered into an arrangement for one upfront sum and payment.

Sara: 

I was at a City Council meeting last night when Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson said the state has only wired 
Flint $2 million of the $6 million approved by the state Legislature. 

She said the city has been told it will receive an additional $2 million in January and another $2 million in April. 
Henderson said she's asked that the money be sent immediately because the city was required to pay Detroit the entire 
$12 million upfront, before the water was reconnected, and its water and sewer fund balance has dropped significantly 
as a result. 

Several council members also spoke about this, and Council President Josh Freeman called the payment plant "beyond 
ridiculous" given the city's financial position. 

Is there someone who can talk to us about this?

Executive Summary 


One provocative pattern to emerge from the Great 
Recession is that instances of acute local fiscal distress 
have clustered in certain states and not others. As recently 
as last year in Michigan, a state appointed Emergency 
Manager was operating in each of 17 local governments 
and school districts. A recent California Policy Center 
report suggests that more than a dozen cities and counties 
in California - a state that has already experienced three 
recent, high-profile municipal bankruptcies and a near- 
bankruptcy in San Jose, the “capital of Silicon Valley” - are 
on the cusp of defaulting on general obligation bonds 

With the generous support of the C.S. Mott Foundation 
and Michigan State University, we have engaged in a 
multi-pronged, multi-method research program to assess 
the crucial but often overlooked role of state governments 
in shaping the ways in which cities respond to financial 
difficulties. This report, based on our analysis of a unique, 
nearly half-century-long dataset of state and local financial 
and policy information and correspondence with state 
officials, analysts and legal experts involved in state-local 
fiscal affairs, elaborates several key findings: 

• Municipal fiscal distress is not simply a local problem. 
State laws and policies provide state governments with 
extraordinary influence over the ability of cities to 
balance revenue and expenditure flows. The common 
perception that critical taxing and spending decisions 
are largely within a city government’s control tends to 
conceal this fundamental detail about American state- 
local fiscal relations. 

• The ways in which state lawmakers act on this 
influence varies from state to state and over time. We 
refer to the complex mix of laws and policies that 
prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions as 
the state context for local fiscal distress. Section 1 of 
this report assesses key elements of this state context 
for the lower 48 states since 1970. 

• Some states incubate local financial stress by 
simultaneously driving up spending pressures on 
their cities while curtailing their capacity to raise 
critical revenue. Since the 1970s, the proliferation of 
state-imposed tax revenue limitations, coupled with 
recurring cuts to state aid, has fostered a system that 
limits a city’s ability to fund critical services. Some 
state governments further undermine the fiscal capacity 


of their cities via state laws and policies that engender 
steep expenditure-side pressures (e.g., devolving 
program responsibilities or driving up labor costs). We 
classify these states as incubators of fiscal distress. 

• Michigan incubates financial stress among its local 
governments. Michigan’s particular mix of stringent 
limitations on local revenue and its relatively low level 
of financial assistance to cities, coupled with spending 
pressures stemming from spiking local service burdens 
and increased labor costs, creates conditions that drive 
up the potential for local fiscal distress. 

• Because state governments can foster dramatically 
different state contexts for local fiscal stress, there is no 
single model policy for state intervention in distressed 
cities or for prevention of local fiscal distress. A 
policy that does not address a state’s unique context 

is unlikely to help cities escape financial trouble over 
the long term. State lawmakers must decide which 
legal and political tradeoffs they are willing to make 
to support city fiscal health. Michigan lawmakers, 
for instance, must recognize that the state context 
contributes to the problem of local fiscal distress. An 
aggressive intervention policy does little to curtail the 
consequences of this state-imposed context. Section 
2 of this report draws policy lessons from comparable 
states in an effort to illustrate alternative approaches to 
state involvement in local fiscal affairs. 

This report’s practical recommendations are aimed at 
assisting the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
policy and legal approach to local fiscal crises. These are 
not overly startling recommendations, yet they are easy to 
neglect because policymakers tend to focus more on short- 
term political gain rather than the histories and unintended 
consequences of policies that, over time, become 
increasingly difficult to alter. Some key recommendations: 

• Creating a state agency that coordinates services to 
local governments and offers technical support and 
fiscal monitoring. 

• Raising awareness among citizens and state decision 
makers that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at 
the local level. Though state governments are certainly 
part of the solution, they can be a big part of the 
problem as well. 


Introduction 


A recent spate of research and media reports suggest that as 
the fiscal consequences of the Great Recession continue to 
subside, state and local fiscal conditions are on the upswing. 
American cities and locales, however, are not yet out of 
the woods. A recent analysis from the National League of 
Cities strikes the proper tone of caution when reporting 
that, though indeed state governments have recovered (albeit 
slowly), “...local fiscal health has not yet fully returned to pre- 
recession levels. ... While tax revenues continue to improve, 
increases in service costs, long-term infrastructure needs, 
employee wages, and pension and healthcare obligations, 
along with decreased levels of state and federal aid, continue 
to constrain the [local] fiscal oudook” (McFarland and 
Pagano, 2014, p. 1, emphasis added). 

One thought-provoking pattern to emerge from the aftermath 
of the Great Recession is that the fiscal outlook seems to 
be particularly bleak among local governments in certain 
states. The city of Detroit’s bankruptcy proceedings may 
have indicated that Michigan is something of a hotbed for 
local financial disaster. Yet a far more damning indicator 
is the prevalence of financial distress among the state’s 
other local governments. As recently as last year, 17 local 
governments and school districts were operating under the 
control of a state-appointed emergency financial manager. 
Recently, Michigan’s most populous county, Wayne, was 
recently designated for financial emergency status as well. 
Michigan does not stand alone. News from California, a 
state that has already seen four cities enter the municipal 
bankruptcy process since 2008, is equally discouraging. The 
authors of a recent report conducted for the California Policy 
Center argue that more than a dozen cities and counties in 
California are statistically far more likely than “a typical U.S. 
city or county” to enter bankruptcy proceedings or default 
on general obligation bonds, with several cities - such as 
Compton, King City, Sutter Creek and lone - are a whopping 
20 to 40 times more likely to experience acute financial crisis 
(Joffe and Larkedring, 2015). 

What is it with local governments in these states? When 
it comes to urban fiscal problems, there is much blame to 
go around. Some blame a mixture of national and global 
economic forces beyond the control of state and local 
policymakers. Others contend that the cities facing severe 
budget crises have only themselves to blame. The goal of 
this report is to refocus attention on the crucial but often 
overlooked role of state governments in determining the ways 
in which cities respond to financial difficulties. How and in 
what specific ways do state governments structure this local 
response? Is it possible to assess the fiscal value that all states 
- via their mix of policies, laws and institutions - may add to 
or take away from local fiscal decision making? Is it truly more 
challenging to gain and maintain fiscal sustainability in certain 


states than it is in others? And in light of this consideration 
of the role that state governments play in structuring local 
fiscal decision making, in what ways do state governments 
choose to - or choose not to - internalize their role in the 
design and administration of their fiscal distress intervention 
policy? In other words, can we identify policy self-awareness 
among state governments that place particularly onerous fiscal 
pressures on their local lawmakers? 

To respond to these important questions, we, with the generous 
support of the C.S. Mott Foundation and Michigan State 
University, set out on a multi-pronged, multi-method research 
program at a critical time in which a new era seems to be 
dawning for state-local fiscal relations. This report summarizes 
the findings of the first stage of this ongoing project. 

Section 1 of this report develops an indicator for the state 
context for local fiscal distress based on the mix of state 
laws and policies that directly influence the revenue and 
spending decisions of local governments. This section 
uncovers a number of compelling patterns in the state 
imposition of revenue and spending pressures over the 
past quarter-century. Chief among these patterns is that, 
although a number of states have taken measures to severely 
limit the revenue capacity of their local governments 
(thus reducing the resources available to maintain critical 
services) and several states have devolved greater service 
responsibilities (and higher spending burdens) to their local 
governments, only a small handful of states simultaneously 
drive up spending pressures while aggressively curtailing 
local governments’ capacity to raise revenue. Taken 
independently, state-imposed revenue- and expenditure-side 
pressures can play a determinative role in local fiscal decision 
making. Taken together, as in states such as Michigan and 
California, they incubate local fiscal distress and can serve to 
foster fundamental budgetary imbalances that more fiscally 
challenged local communities are ill-equipped to overcome. 

In Section 2, we draw on interpersonal communications 
with key personnel in several states to assess key elements 
of state policies for intervening in fiscally distressed 
local governments. We set out to identify similarities in 
intervention policies - of which Michigan’s is the poster 
child - and to learn how other states approach local fiscal 
crises differently. From our work with the state officials, we 
illustrate how state governments can more effectively align 
policy with the nature of the problems faced by cities in 
distress, as well as how state-imposed constraints hamper 
cities’ abilities to balance revenues and expenditures over the 
long-term. In Section 3, we combine the lessons from Sections 
1 and 2 to outline recommendations that can assist the C.S. 
Mott Foundation, state and local officials, and Michigan 
residents in identifying a more effective approach to local 
fiscal crises. 


Section 1: Assessing How States Set the 
Context for Local Fiscal Distress: Revenue 
Squeezes and Expenditure-side Pressures 


Two essential powers that local officials enjoy are their 
authority to raise revenues and their power to allocate 
those revenues as they see fit via public expenditures. In 
local media and policy research, city officials are sometimes 
lauded for what are perceived as exciting local policy 
outcomes, such as when a city makes a significant move 
up the “America’s Greenest Cities” or “Child Well-being 
and Health” rankings. More commonly, they are chastised 
for decisions deemed detrimental to the city’s future, 
such as providing generous benefits to the municipal 
workforce, slashing essential services, enacting a rigid 
historical preservation agenda or raising licensing fees. Yet 
the common perception that critical taxing and spending 
decisions - and, by extension, the apportionment of blame 
and credit associated with the outcomes of such decisions 
- are largely within a city government’s control conceals 
a fundamental detail about American state-local fiscal 
relations: state laws and policies provide state governments 
with extraordinary influence over nearly every aspect of city 
budgeting. From the type and level of financial assistance 
that state governments deliver to state-imposed controls 
over local revenues; to the growing practice and use of 
state mandates, preapproval and preemption; to minimum 
service standards; to the formal or informal consultations, 
advice or technical assistance that state governments may 
(or may not) provide, local governments in America, in the 
words of influential legal scholars Gerald Frug and David 
Barron (2008, p. 75), simply “do not have anything like the 
kind of local fiscal autonomy often attributed to them.” 

States influence local governments’ capacity to balance 
revenue and expenditure flows in a variety of ways. In 
this report, we focus on two core dimensions of this 
state context for local financial distress. 1 The first is the 
degree to which states participate in adding or reducing 
local revenue capacity via the policy balance between the 
buoyancy of state-granted aid and shared revenue, and the 
severity of state-imposed controls over city tax revenues. 
Although most states exhibit a relatively balanced policy 
approach to local revenue capacity, some state governments 
have responded to local revenue challenges by granting 
greater access to state intergovernmental aid while mostly 
suppressing financial controls over local taxes. These 
are revenue “carrot” states. Another group - revenue 

1 Formally defined as the complex, multidimensional, legal-policy 
frameworks that prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions. 


“stick” states, of which Michigan is a prime example - have 
responded to local revenue challenges by ratcheting financial 
controls while offering thin or uncertain compensatory 
aid. Simply put, we expect it to be far more challenging 
to maintain a sustainable fiscal outlook in states that 
simultaneously suppress own-source revenue capacity and 
transfer very little aid to municipalities, particularly during 
national or state economic downturns. 

State policies and actions also burden the opposite 
end of local budgetary processes: decisions over public 
expenditures. Few, if any, local spending responsibilities 
exist because cities choose to take them on. The state 
decides. 2 Spending pressures can be subtler. For instance, 
local labor costs, which account for a large slice of most 
cities’ budgets, are heavily influenced by state policies and 
regulations concerning municipal employees’ wages and 
level of retirement and health care benefits. 3 This basic 
fact should give pause to those who instinctively attribute 
chronic local fiscal distress to “profligate spending on public 
employees” (Greenhut, 2012, pp. 1-2) or “spiraling labor 
and pension costs” (Rozansky, 2012). To borrow again from 
Frug and Barron’s seminal work (2008, p. 199), “Although 
cities are often criticized for granting overly generous 
pensions and health care to their employees, sometimes 
they become supporters of municipal employees’ benefits 
because the state requires them to do so.” Our more general 
argument here is that it is foolish to claim to correctly 
diagnose the causes of local fiscal distress without careful 
examination of the spending context in which states place 
their cities. In this paper, we aim to capture a large slice 
of this expenditure-side context by assessing state public 
sector collective bargaining policies (specifically, those 
covering municipal police, firefighters, teachers and other 
local employees) and public employee union membership 
coverage. 


2 Via specific provisions (or the absence of such provisions) regarding 
local statutory authorization, budgetary constraints or more general 
interpretations of local governments’ home rule authority. 

3 For instance, Michigan, even after the adoption of right-to-work 
legislation in late 2012, mandates binding arbitration for public safety 
officers in the event that involved parties in a labor contract dispute 
cannot reach an agreement. Massachusetts pays out benefits to local 
employees through the State-Boston Retirement System via formulas 
established by state law. Illinois law does not mandate city or employee 
benefit or contribution levels, instead favoring local flexibility in the 
control over pension costs. 




The final segment of this section considers how these 
revenue- and expenditure-side pressures interact within 
and across all U.S. state governments. As one might expect 
(or at least hope), these two competing dimensions tend 
to work against one another. States that are more revenue 
stick (meaning local tax limitation increases outpace 
the distribution of state aid) tend not to impose equally 
exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least in relation to 
local labor costs. For many states that do drive up labor 
and service costs via their mixture of policies, these costs 
are at least partially offset via a more resilient and vibrant 
aid environment, coupled with limited own-source revenue 
restrictions. A few states, such as Michigan and California, 
place strict limits on local own-source revenues while at the 
same time providing only meager intergovernmental aid and 
imposing costly labor and service obligations. We contend 
that these states have structured local fiscal policymaking 
in a way that effectively incubates local financial distress. 
These state contexts are the most egregious in hampering 
the exercise of local fiscal power; yet the nature of the 
problem for cities may be much worse - state-imposed 
budgetary imbalances can engender recurring structural 
deficits and diminished local service capacity, particularly 
among the states’ older, industrial urban areas.

State governments, by virtue of their superior constitutional 
position, have sweeping legal powers to regulate local 
finance. Central to our assessment of the state’s role 
in local fiscal distress are state controls over the two 
dominant sources of city revenue: state aid and local 

Figure 1. Mapping the Average 
State Aid Environment Since 1970 


taxes. Local governments occupy a weak position in the 
American federal system, causing local officials to rely 
heavily on, in the words of one analyst, “whatever sources 
of income the states are willing to let them tap into” or 
“whatever financial assistance” the states are willing to 
provide (Berman, 2003, p. 89). Sbragia (1983) aptly refers 
to the condition of American federalism as “the municipal 
money chase,” and in the absence of a vibrant federal aid 
environment in the United States, state aid - in the form 
of shared taxes (typically sales, income and gasoline) and 
restricted or unrestricted grants - continues to be a major 
source of local government revenue, accounting for roughly 
a third of local revenue, on average, during the past two 
decades (Berman, 2003; Urahn et al., 20 12). 4 

The importance of a well-designed state aid system is hard 
to overstate. It allows local officials greater flexibility in 
responding to economic pressures and the service needs of 
residents. This flexibility is particularly valuable during 
periods of economic downturn. Because local governments 
vary widely in their tax bases and in their ability to raise 
critical own-source revenues, influential research illustrates 
the equalizing potential of state aid, particularly in helping 
to smooth out revenue gaps between wealthier and poorer 
local jurisdictions (Pelissero, 1984; Stein and Hamm, 1987). 
In the past few decades, very few states target aid to local 
governments as a function of local need (Stein and Hamm, 

4 Though formulas for the distribution of local aid can vary significantly 
across states (as well as within states over time), all states provide 
some form of aid to local governments - often from a historical 
exchange in which cities would forgo the right to collect certain taxes 
in exchange for the states returning revenues from those taxes in some 
form. States typically allocate shared revenue for specific purposes 
or link it to particular functions of local government. Some shared 
revenue, however, is unhindered by such state restrictions and can be 
spent as local lawmakers see fit.

1994). The level of state aid that is available can make 
it possible for certain jurisdictions - for instance, older, 
industrial cities experiencing significant job loss coupled 
with a much reduced tax base - to at least afford minimum 
levels of services and possibly respond to growing service 
demands on the heels of a crippling state or national 
recession (see Ladd and Yinger, 1994). 

How then can we characterize the critical state aid portion 
of the state-controlled revenue environment for American 
cities? Figure 1, which illustrates trends in per capita state 
aid to three classes of city governments, shows a steady 
upward trend in transfers (per capita) received from state 
governments. Though it is beyond the scope of this project 
to analyze specific revenue-sharing rules and aid formulas 
over time and across state contexts, our city financial data 
allow us to compare important trends in what the Census 
of Governments classifies as “Total Intergovernmental 
Revenue from the State Government.” 5 In other words, we 
plot data indicating the fiscal outputs of these rules and 
decisions. As Figure 1 illustrates, the positive trend over 
time is particularly strong for cities with populations over 
100, 000. 6 On average, it would seem that state governments 
have helped at least larger cities meet increasingly 
difficult financial conditions through the extension of 
intergovernmental transfers. 

Figure 2, which compares levels and growth of per capita 
state aid across the contiguous 48 states, paints a bleaker 
portrait. Consistent with the findings presented in Figure 
1, 43 of the 48 states exhibit positive growth rates, meaning 
that roughly 90 percent of the lower 48 states provided 
higher levels of aid in the current era than in the early 1970s 
(mean increase = 256 percent). Figure 1, however, masks 
the considerable unevenness with which state governments 
deliver aid. This unevenness is on display in Figure 2, 
where fewer states provide above average levels of aid, and 
most states exhibit relatively flat growth in the distribution 
of state aid. 7 


5 This includes state grants-in-aid, regardless of basis of distribution; 
local share of state-collected taxes; payments in lieu of taxes on 
state property; and reimbursement for services performed for state 
government (e.g., care of state prisoners in local jails, construction 
or maintenance of state highway facilities, etc.) (U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, 2006). 

6 In 1970, these cities received roughly $160 per capita (in real 2005 
dollars) in state intergovernmental revenue; in 2005, the most recent 
year in our time series, average per capita aid was $470. Though the 
growth rate for small and medium-sized cities is not as steep, the 
steady uptick in average per capita state aid exemplifies a healthier 
state aid environment than in the past. 

7 As is indicated by the maroon-colored vertical line, the average 
per capita aid provided to local governments in 2005 was just over 
$340. Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and Utah provided around $40 per 
person, on average. New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, on the other hand, distributed intergovernmental 
revenue at an annual rate at or around $1,000 per resident.

One key reason for this unevenness is that state aid tends to 
ebb and flow with changing state-level economic conditions 
(Berman, 2003, pp. 100-102). More generally, state 
intergovernmental aid - particularly those discretionary 
resources distributed via statutory aid policies and 
unprotected by state constitutions - is inextricably linked 
to state legislative budget battles. State legislatures and 
governors, scrambling to balance their own budgets, are 
simply more likely to risk citizen backlash from significant 
aid cuts during periods of widespread budget shortfalls. 
What is more, state lawmakers across the country seem to 
be looking with decreasing favorability on the idea of, in 
the derisive words of one Wisconsin legislator, “being an 
ATM machine for local governments” (Rinard, 1999, p. 1). 

Figure 2, however, illustrates that not all states have chosen 
to respond to their revenue difficulties by making cuts 
to intergovernmental aid. A study from Pew’s American 
Cities Project reports that Connecticut, which provides 
one of the more vibrant aid environments in the country, 
chose to slightly bolster intergovernmental aid to its 
local governments on the heels of the Great Recession (in 
fiscal year 2010) and has not reported a cut since then. 
Nebraska, on the other hand, canceled all funding to its 
local governments in 2011; Maryland, California, Arizona, 
Nevada, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming made 5 
to 6 percent cuts that same year. All else being equal, we 
would expect it to be far less onerous to balance revenue 
and expenditure flows in city governments in states such 
as Connecticut, New York or Massachusetts - i.e., states 
where key state decision makers seem less inclined to 
shift service costs to local governments via cuts in state 
aid during times of state financial stress - than in cities 

Figure 3. Proliferation and 
Layering of TELs Since 1970 


facing similar sets of environmental, political or managerial 
conditions in states that provide lower or more volatile 
levels of intergovernmental aid. 

State policies regarding levels and delivery of state aid are 
but one piece of an increasingly complex set of structures 
that govern local revenue capacity. In a classic textbook 
on American intergovernmental relations, Stephens and 
Wikstrom (2006, p. 196) remark, “Without doubt, the most 
important mechanism that the state has for influencing 
the political behavior of local officials involves financial 
assistance.” This may have been true in the 1970s or 1980s, 
and to be sure it is a fundamental tenet of traditional 
models of fiscal federalism, but the most important 
mechanism for controlling local fiscal behavior in the past 
quarter- century is the tax and expenditure limit (TEL) - 
a label that broadly captures state attempts to limit the 
taxing and/or spending authority of its local governments 
through constitutional amendment or legislative enactment. 

State governments have long imposed some manner of 
TEL. 8 Figure 3 tracks the adoption of TELs since 1970 
across the four most common categories: rate limits - which 
are overall or specific tax rate limits that set the ceiling on 
the aggregate tax rate, which cannot be exceeded without 
a vote of the electorate; property tax levy limits, which 
constrain the total amount of revenue that can be raised 
from the property tax (independent of the property tax 
rate); assessment increase limits, which cap the growth rate of 
assessed values and is intended to control the ability of 
local government to raise revenue either by reassessment 
of property or through escalation of property values; and 

8 For instance, the first states to establish property tax rate limits were 
Rhode Island (1870), Nevada (1895), Oklahoma (1907) and Ohio (1911). 



8 





limits on general revenue or general expenditure increases, which 
set the maximum growth rate of total revenue or total 
spending. 

Whereas a great deal of research has shown that the 
appearance of even a single TEL constrains the capacity 
of local officials to generate revenues on their own (see 
Poterba and Rueben, 1995; Shadbegian, 1996, 1999; it is 
the accumulation or layering of fiscal constraints that can 
be particularly damaging to the revenue capacity of local 
lawmakers. 9 In single-TEL states, for instance, raising 
assessments might be employed to circumvent property 
tax rate limits and vice versa; in states that impose only 
an assessment cap, this single limitation could potentially 
be overcome by adopting a higher rate. These methods 
of circumvention were common early in the 1970s, when 
24 of the 29 states adopting some form of TEL imposed 
only one constraint (mostly rate limits), and a mere five 
states imposed two revenue TELs. Today, at least 27 of 
the contiguous 48 states impose multiple revenue TELs. 
Nineteen states impose two, and eight states - Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Mexico and Washington - apply three local tax limitations. 

The number of TELs in a state does not necessarily capture 
the severity of the limitation(s), though it is reasonable 
to expect a higher frequency of TELs to create a more 
restrictive local tax environment. Figure 4 displays a 
measure of TEL severity (see appendix regarding our 
research approach beginning on page 25), with the open 
point illustrating the severity of the state’s TEL in 1970, 
the closed (maroon) point plotting restrictiveness in 2005, 
and the dashed horizontal line representing the change 
in severity of the state’s tax limitations. 10 Figure 4 reveals 
some noteworthy patterns that illustrate the reality of state 
policy choices regarding local tax structures. Michigan, a 
state that imposes one of the more onerous sets of revenue 
restrictions, achieved this status via a one-two punch of 
major constitutional amendments enacted by voters: the 
Headlee Amendment in 1978 and Proposal A in 1994. 11 The 
Headlee Amendment capped local property tax millage 
rates to the rate of inflation. Proposal A - a constitutional 
amendment quite similar to Proposition 13 in California, a 
state with a similarly restrictive fiscal relationship with its 
locales - further limited local property tax revenue growth 

9 Rising adoption rates are on display in Figure 3. So, too, is the 
increasingly common phenomenon of TEL layering, meaning the 
imposition of state-imposed controls on multiple elements of the 
local tax structure. And those controls are growing: in 1970, 29 of the 
contiguous 48 states had at least one revenue TEL; today, some 41 of 48 
states have at least one local revenue limit. 

10 The measure of TEL severity, initially proposed by Amiel, Deller and 
Stallmann (2009), indexes six key characteristics: the type of TEL (see 
discussion above), if the TEL is statutory or constitutional, growth 
restrictions, method of TEL approval, TEL overrides and exemptions, 
and method of override. For a more detailed discussion of this 
measure, see Amiel, Deller, and Stallmann (2009) and Maher and 
Deller (2013).

by changing the system of assessment to cap individual 
property values and prohibiting cities from “rolling up” 
a millage to the rate of inflation if actual property value 
growth was lower than inflation. 12 Taken together, these 
two large TEL ratchets, which came 17 years apart and 
layered on top of an already aggressive property tax rate 
limit, placed tremendous pressure on local lawmakers’ 
ability to generate critical revenue (Brunori et al., 2008). 
Contrast Michigan’s approach to that of Massachusetts’s 
Prop 2 Vi, a similarly infamous state-imposed TEL, which 
was passed by referendum in 1980 and effectively caps 
local property tax levies at 2.5 percent of real property 
value. Massachusetts’s relatively moderate position on the 
severity index owes much to the state’s choice to apply no 
corresponding rate, revenue or assessment limits on local 
lawmakers. 

TELs, taken alone, are neither inherently good nor bad. 

They have been alternately portrayed as necessary evils 
for taming “Leviathan” city governments (Brennan and 
Buchanan, 1979; Craw, 2008; Downes and Figlio, 1999), 
or as just plain evils that stifle cities’ abilities to pursue 
innovative visions for their futures (Frug and Barron, 

2008). 13 However, over three decades after the tax revolt 
movement took hold in a major way in states such as 
California and Michigan, the widespread adoption of local 
TELs depicted in Figures 1 and 2 has had two overarching 
effects: the first is the loss of local revenues; the second is 
decreasing local reliance on property taxes. 14 There is little 
evidence to suggest that TELs, however, promote local fiscal 
sustainability. The reason is that local spending mostly 
goes unaffected by revenue limits (Dye and McGuire, 1997), 
particularly in the absence of state-imposed spending lids, 
which exist in only a small handful of states. 15 

In sum, the proliferation of state-imposed TELs has 
helped to create a national state-local fiscal system that 
is simply less conducive to local governments’ abilities to 
fund their own activities. 15 States with more aggressive 
local TELs - such as Michigan, Colorado and California 

12 Many other provisions of both the Headlee Amendment and Proposal 
A are related to other parts of the state finance system, and a detailed 
examination of the depth of both laws would be a paper unto itself. 

We will discuss the impacts of these types of laws, generally and in 
Michigan, later in the paper. 

13 To be sure, they are a frequent source of local consternation, 
particularly as fixed costs occupy a larger share of local budgets and 
demand for services - driven by postrecession unemployment rates, 
population changes and other factors - continues to rise. 

14 Indeed, in many state contexts, forgone property tax revenues have at 
least partially been recovered via more regressive revenue sources - 
such as fees and, where allowed, sales taxes. 

15 This is an important point that is often obscured by the frequent 
reliance on the TEL acronym (Tax and Expenditure Limits). 

16 Amidst the national clamor for government austerity and fiscal 
responsibility, it is important to point out that these activities - 
particularly in the states that impose the most formidable set of 
revenue constraints, such as Michigan, California and Colorado - 
include essential local services such as public safety and infrastructure 
maintenance, which are critical functions of local government. 


- hinder the revenue capacity of their local governments. 
This capacity is vital during even the most moderate of 
economic downturns because service demands tend to 
rise and state aid tends to drop. Revenue slack, however, 
was particularly vital during the most recent recession. In 
previous downturns, home prices mostly remained stable, 
thus steadying property tax revenues (particularly in 
relation to sales and income taxes). In the 2009 recession, 
property tax revenues, already slowed in certain states 
via state-imposed TELs, plummeted in simultaneity with 
state aid. The good news, as we illustrate below, is that 
a relatively small number of states impose such crippling 
revenue constraints from both ends: meaning states 
that both limit own-source revenue capacity while also 
providing far from vibrant levels of state aid. The bad news 
is that, for local officials who must operate within those 
state environments, even small declines in revenues can 
present tremendous budgetary challenges. 

Napping the Revenue Squeeze: Revenue 
“Carrot" and Revenue “Stick” States 

As property tax revenues continue to erode as a function 
of state-imposed TELs and local governments have become 
more reliant on state aid, some observers have suggested 
that state governments have responded to their expanding 
role in local fiscal affairs by providing greater levels of 
intergovernmental revenues (Berman, 2003; Sokolow, 2000; 
Dye and McGuire, 1997b). 17 This reading of state-local fiscal 
dynamics is somewhat supported by comparing trends in 
average levels of state aid to local governments exhibited 
in Figure 1 and total revenue limit adoptions depicted in 
Figure 3. However, our data allow for a far more detailed 
look at how local revenue capacity is being affected by state 
policies for local governments within each of the lower 48 
states. 

Figure 5 depicts a rough state-level indicator of the severity 
of state restrictions on local revenue capacity. States for 
which our standardized measure of per capita state aid 
far exceeds our standardized measure of the severity of 
local revenue limits - such as Connecticut, New York, 
Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey - 
are depicted in orange and labeled revenue carrot states. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be buttressed by 
their state context. As was pointed out above, a well- 
structured state aid environment increases the overall fiscal 
capacity of local governments and, according to Pagano and 
Hoene (2010, p. 260), can provide “a level of equalization 
and base support for municipalities that may lack other 
resources.” Additional value to local revenue capacity 
stems from the fact that critical own-source revenues are 

17 Greater local reliance on state aid does not necessarily mean that 
state officials have “anteed up,” a point that, mainly because of data 
constraints, is too often overlooked.

either altogether unencumbered by the absence of state 
TELs, as in Connecticut; limited only on the margins, as in 
Rhode Island or Tennessee; or limited via more aggressive 
TELs offset via significant funding from the state, as in 
Massachusetts. 

Revenue stick states - such as Michigan, Colorado, 

Washington and California - are depicted in brown. These 
state governments (or state citizens via the referendum or 
initiative process) constrain the fiscal autonomy of local 

government officials rather than buttress it via state aid. Figure 5. Revenue “Carrot” and Revenue “Stick” 
An extensive body of research on the local effects of state- States 
imposed TELs strongly suggests that revenue limits have 
worked: local own-source revenues have been reduced in 
the states that impose such limitations. Though there is 
some historical evidence that state legislatures in certain 
states have offset these limitations via state aid (Mullins 
and Joyce, 1996), revenue stick states tend to be far less 
generous in the allocation of intergovernmental revenue. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be constrained by 
their state context. 

Michigan, for instance, has a TEL score well above the 
most recent annual state average, coupled with slightly 
below average state aid. The problem with local fiscal 
sustainability in revenue stick states such as Michigan 
stems from local governments’ heightened reliance on 
state revenues, which in Michigan is a function of two 
large TEL ratchets and, in the post-Great Recession period, 
sharply declining property tax revenues. This high degree 
of dependency remains in place today. Yet, much like the 
way that Michigan’s Proposition A has exposed critical local 
education funding to state budgetary battles (Cullen and 
Loeb, 2004), the state’s unyielding property tax rate limits, 
coupled with special features of the Headlee Amendment 
that forbid the use of some alternative revenue sources 
employed in other states (e.g., income, sales and motor fuel 
taxes), have had the unfortunate side effect of essentially 
entwining local fiscal health with state legislative politics. 

As the state economy faltered under a one-state recession 
throughout much of the 2000s (Darga, 2011), the past 
decade has seen both clear declines in statutory revenue 
sharing and heightened levels of uncertainty over revenue- 
sharing rules (Lavelle, 2014, pp. 2-3). 

Michigan’s is a precarious fiscal context even for the most 
well-managed city government. It is particularly onerous 
for lawmakers in older, industrial cities such as Flint, 
which has been dealing for some time with sustained 
job and population loss, waning bureaucratic capacity, 
and increasingly daunting economic, social and physical 
challenges (see Doidge et al., 2015). In the words of one 
local official, if aid is reduced, “It’s not rocket science ... 
pretty much raise taxes or cut services. That’s what it boils 
down to” (McDermott and Powers, 2002, p. 12). Local 
lawmakers in a state such as Michigan, where they operate 



11 




with very limited discretion over revenue capacity, can boil 
it down even further: reduce or eliminate services or face 
the prospects of possible financial meltdown. All cities face 
political constraints on raising tax revenue. And certainly, 
some cities have managed their financial affairs in the face 
of economic decline better than others. However, for those 
seeking to fully grasp the nature of local fiscal health, we 
must continue to focus on ways in which states effectively 
create a mismatch between fiscal needs and available 
resources into their cities’ local fiscal decision-making 
environment.

In addition to the revenue squeeze that some states impose 
on their local governments, state governments also impose 
a range of expenditure-side pressures that can drive up 
local costs. 18 As state governments continue to streamline 
bureaucracies and downsize operations, service burdens 
have been shifted onto local governments, often “without 
careful consideration whether this was the correct 
course” (Gold and Wallin, 1999, p. 73). As one prominent 
National League of Cities report argues (2003, p. 23), the 
transference of “program responsibilities from state and 
federal government, as well as the imposition of state and 
federal mandates, increase the roles and responsibilities of 
municipal governments, often without corresponding fiscal 
capacity or authority.” Observers and analysts interested 
in the expenditure-side burdens that state policies place 
on local officials typically focus on the effects that costly 
mandates in areas such as health care and pollution 
abatement have on local government budgets (see Berman, 
2003, pp. 77-83). Far less attention is paid to what we might 
call de facto spending pressures - the hidden but potentially 
damaging state-level decisions, policies and institutions 
that can destabilize local governments’ fiscal capacity. 

Consider, as we do in this report, local governments’ large 
and increasing burden to pay for previously obligated 
labor costs. Labor costs, including wages and benefits 
for current employees as well as pensions and other 
postemployment benefits (OPEB) such as retiree healthcare, 
currently make up the largest category of operating costs 
for local governments. As pointed out in a recent MSU 
white paper (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013), municipalities 
were not required to measure the total costs of OPEB 
until an accounting standard was issued in 2004, with 
implementation beginning in 2007. Now that local 
governments have calculated and accounted for OPEB, 

18 This general phenomenon has been termed “second-order devolution” 

- meaning the transfer of program administration and/or substantive 
policy powers from the federal and state governments to America’s 
cities and municipalities (see Bowman and Kearney, 2011). 


many are faced with a massive commitment. Indeed, 

MSU’s review of Michigan cities facing severe fiscal stress 
revealed that each city was confronted with a substantial 
unfunded OPEB liability (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013). 

Though local government employee pensions and OPEB 
are seemingly always in the headlines, few seem to be 
asking why observers are more able to link labor costs 
to local fiscal distress in certain states than in others. 

Why do we hear so much about Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
California, Rhode Island and New Jersey? The answer, 
not surprisingly, is that, although city lawmakers are 
often criticized for overly cozy relationships with public 
employee labor unions (see, for instance, Gillette, 2014a; 
Rozansky, 2012; Greenhut, 2012), critical elements of 
employee benefit costs are structured by state law. State 
law may require bargaining by the employer, may provide 
only for a bargaining forum without requiring it or, 
alternatively, may simply prohibit collective bargaining 
altogether. State laws vary in the coverage of certain types 
of local employees. These rules address the types of items 
that may be bargained over, such as work rules, pay and 
benefits. Finally, the collective bargaining laws may include 
a process for dealing with impasses, such as binding 
arbitration rules. In line with the framework proposed 
at this report’s outset, we view the mix of these rules as a 
set of processes and constraints that directly influence a 
municipality’s fiscal capacity. 

Table 1 places the local public employee collective 
bargaining environment of the contiguous 48 states into a 
five-category classification scheme ranging from very weak 
to very strong. (See the research approach appendix for 
a more detailed explanation of this measure.) As Table 
1 makes plain, states vary with respect to the collective 
bargaining environment for local public employees. Not 
surprisingly, states with strong and very strong collective 
bargaining environments (e.g., those that impose a duty 
to bargain with strong union security provisions) have 
comparatively high union membership rates as well, 
with New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, 
Pennsylvania and Michigan each holding union membership 
rates in excess of 50 percent of state public employees. 
Unionization rates in weak and very weak states, such as 
Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, New Mexico, 
Wyoming, Utah, Georgia and Virginia, on the other hand, 
tend to fall around 10 percent. 19 

State laws concerning pensions and health benefits 
illustrate, in part, how state-imposed structures affect city 
expenditure choices. Yet recent attention to employee 
compensation, pension system funding/underfunding 
and, especially, the cumulative impact of local government 
employee costs on current municipal cash flows have 

19 Statistics from Union Membership and Coverage Database (see Hirsch 
and Macpherson, 2003). 


12 



brought these issues, in particular, into national focus. To 
be clear, we do not suggest that a non-unionized workforce 
is the key to a fiscally sustainable city. City governments 
must compete with other employers for workers, and 
rules governing bargaining are part of a state’s larger 
labor culture. Our simple argument is that, in light of the 
sizeable role for local labor costs in local budgeting as well 
the implementation of new accounting standards, city 
governments operating within states with more permissive 
collective bargaining provisions are more likely to face 
budgetary constraints. It is easy to pin these constraints 
on lousy decision making, yet these constraints owe much 
to higher labor costs and the cumulative costs of payment 
decisions that are, to a large degree, governed by state 
policy. 

C3) The Stale Context for Local 
Fiscal Distress^ Tension Between 
Hexenne and Expenditure Pressures 

Analysis of the interplay of revenue and expenditure 
pressures allows for a more detailed assessment of the 
nature of the fiscal context in which states place their 


local lawmakers. We offer this analysis as something of a 
corrective to the typical perception that a city’s financial 
destiny is either entirely within or entirely outside of its 
control. When assessing why certain local governments 
seem to respond more effectively to their financial problems 
than others, our research suggests that identifying on 
Figure 6 (see page 14) the state in which the city is located 
is a good place to start. The state’s coordinates represent 
an empirical measure of the state context for local fiscal 
distress - meaning the tension for local lawmakers between 
state- imposed revenue-side pressures (captured on the 
horizontal axis) and state-imposed expenditure-side 
pressures (captured on the vertical axis). 20 

20 More technically, the horizontal axis captures our measure of the 
revenue pressures that states inflict upon their local governments 
(standardized TEL severity score minus standardized average per 
capita aid score). The vertical axis represents a standardized measure 
of public employee union coverage, an approximation of the severity 
of the average city’s relatively fixed labor costs. The light gray 
shading represents the distance between one quartile above and one 
quartile below the median; thus states that appear outside these two 
intersecting ranges are quite different from average on both elements of 
the state context. Dark shaded points indicate state governments that 
authorize state intervention in financially distressed local governments.

If state-imposed revenue pressures increased with the 
severity of expenditure pressures, or vice versa, we would 
expect a positive “best fit” line (the dark curving line in 
Figure 6) moving from the lower left-hand quadrant to 
the upper right. As one might expect (or at least hope), 
these two elements of the state context tend to offset each 
other. States such as Colorado and New Mexico - i.e., 
more revenue stick states (local tax limitation increases 
outpace growth in the distribution of state aid) - avoid 
equally exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least when 
it comes to local labor costs. For states that do structure 
local collective bargaining in a way that favors higher local 
labor costs - such as New York, Connecticut and Rhode 
Island - these costs are at least partially offset by a more 
resilient and vibrant aid environment, coupled with limited 
own-source revenue restrictions. 

The relationship between these two elements of the state 
context is negative, but it is not a purely linear relationship. 
Figure 6’s most striking feature is its illustration that states 
placing extreme limitations on local revenue capacity 
(meaning they are more than one standard deviation 
above the state average on the horizontal axis) also tend to 
impose costly labor and service obligations (more than one 
standard deviation above the state average on the vertical 
axis). This relationship between revenue and expenditure 
pressures creates a best-fit line that resembles a backwards 
“J”. This small handful of states that pull the line upward 
- which include Michigan and California - cluster in the 
upper right-hand quadrant of Figure 6. It is no surprise 
that acute financial emergencies have clustered in these 
states. We contend that they have structured local fiscal 
policymaking in a way that effectively incubates financial 
distress. Table 2 classifies the states in an effort to clearly 
represent the position of each of the lower 48 states along 
these two dimensions. 


The threat of recurring structural deficits is “baked in” to 
the state-imposed legal and policy context in which local 
governments choose how to respond to fiscal problems. For 
lawmakers in America’s older, industrial cities who must 
operate within these states, that choice is often not theirs 
to make. As we point out above, these states apply revenue 
and expenditure pressures on the front end, while also 
fostering a fiscal environment that exacerbates fiscal stress, 
links local fiscal health to budgetary battles, and all in all 
restricts the policy “space” for local fiscal policymaking. 
Michigan, however, is the only state among the incubators 
in the top right quadrant of Table 2 and Figure 6 that also 
intervenes “on the back end” by assertively implementing 
one of the nation’s most powerful fiscal distress 
intervention policies (Anderson, 2011; Scorsone, 2014). 

In light of the clustering of distressed localities within 
Michigan’s borders, it comes as little surprise that Michigan 
lawmakers would value a policy that allows state officials 
to help struggling local governments meet conditions of 
chronic fiscal stress (Scorsone and Bateson, 2011; Doidge 
et al., 2015). However, as we discuss below, what is quite 
striking is the relationship between the policy’s goals and 
design - which favors state takeover of local government 
- and the nature and underlying causes of the problem 
of acute fiscal distress. The financial consequences of 
deep-rooted economic and social forces are unlikely to 
be fully alleviated via temporary suspension of local self- 
government. Neither are the often overlooked but critically 
important state-imposed causes analyzed above. In what 
follows, we survey the state governments with more holistic 
and self-aware views of local financial distress in an effort 
to draw important lessons for Michigan lawmakers as they 
continue to struggle with chronic fiscal stress among the 
state’s localities. 


Section 2: If Takeover is the Solution, then 
what is the Problem? What Michigan Can 
Learn from the Ways in Which Other States 
Tackle Problems of Local Fiscal Distress 


In the previous section, we make the case that state 
governments influence how local officials meet their 
financial problems via a combination of laws and policies 
that add or take away intergovernmental or own-source 
revenue capacity and drive up expenditure pressures 
via the allocation of policy authority over government 
functions and labor costs. In certain instances, such as 
when a state government caps property tax revenue and 
sets near insurmountable override standards, the effects 
of certain elements of the state context may be more or 
less direct. A city facing a near identical set of political, 
institutional, economic and social circumstances that 
operates in a neighboring state with no such revenue cap 
at least has the potential to capitalize on this capacity, 
assuming local political and economic constraints allow for 
the imposition of a property tax increase. But mostly the 
effects of this state context are more indirect. The policy 
balance between revenue restrictions and state aid, for 
instance, is not so much a direct measure of state policy 
choice as it is an outcome of a variety of state policy choices 
- e.g., revenue-sharing rules and formulae, the outcomes of 
citizen initiatives involving local TELs, legislative-executive 
budgetary processes, bureaucratic turf battles and so on. 

Since as far back as the late 19* century, when the 
proliferation of railroad bankruptcies prompted states 
to take action to assist struggling localities (see Dimock, 
1935 and 1940), state lawmakers, for fear that “a failing 
municipality will lower the credit rating of other localities 
and the state itself” (Berman, 2003, p. 113), have played a 
far more direct role in responding to local financial distress. 
The current menu of state policy options for intervening in 
distressed communities has been reviewed in two recent 
reports, one by Pew Charitable Trust researchers (Atwell et 
al., 2013) and a second by one of the authors of this report 
(Scorsone, 2014). One key shortcoming of these reports 
is the absence of detailed consideration of state context. 
Simply put, some states are part of the problem - they 
incubate financial distress via stringent restrictions on 
local revenue capacity and state policies precipitating local 
spending pressures. In other states, local policy options 
regarding the balance of revenue and expenditure flows are 
less encumbered by state policies and institutions. This 
diversity among state contexts is particularly important 
when reflecting on “best practices” for states dealing with 


acute local fiscal distress. For instance, close followers 
of issues of local finance often hear and read about North 
Carolina’s strong oversight and monitoring mechanisms 
as standards to which state governments should aspire 
(see, for instance, Mattoon, 2014). But does it make sense 
for a state such as Michigan or New Jersey, for instance, 
to adhere to similar policy principles when local fiscal 
policymaking is structured in such dramatically different 
ways? 

A second shortcoming of these reports is the dearth of 
detailed comparison among the 18 state governments that 
currently have an intervention policy. We refer readers 
to these reports for their quality in cataloguing the formal 
policy powers of state lawmakers on paper. Neither, 
however, is as useful at considering these policies in 
practice. This is a key tension in policy analysis generally 
and in instances of intervention in particular. The choice 
of the state’s appointed and elected officials to employ 
the power they have at their disposal and intervene in 
a distressed community (often meaning the temporary 
suspension of democratic processes) presents a particular 
type of implementation dilemma imbued with questions of 
racial bias, social and economic imbalances, and the legal 
and political culture that guides state-local relations. 

To fully assess the role of state governments in financial 
distress, we held a workshop for state government officials, 
analysts and experts with deep knowledge of state 
operations in local financial affairs. The Workshop on State 
Intervention in Distressed Communities, held in the fall 
of 2014 in Detroit, ultimately brought together a diverse 
group of 28 practitioners and policy experts from six states 
facing similar sets of local fiscal problems: Michigan, Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. 21 
The appendix provides a detailed overview of the structure 
of the event and the types of discussions that were held. 

Our primary goal was to provide a venue facilitating the 
open exchange of ideas and techniques for approaching the 
complicated problems facing cities in fiscal crisis. Indeed, 
as we discuss below, one recommendation of this research 

21 This portion of the process focused specifically on how states approach 
intervention. Though many of the participants in the workshop 
were intimately involved in making decisions at the city level, we 
intentionally chose participants representing the state perspective 
rather than that of local decision makers. 


16 




report is to continue to advance this and similarly minded 
endeavors as a means of facilitating what Peter May (1992) 
refers to as “instrumental policy learning,” which can 
improve state officials’ understanding of the benefits and 
limitations of particular policy approaches or administrative 
designs. A second goal centers on learning more about the 
states’ implementation processes for deciding whether to 
designate a city in distress, take it over temporarily or, in 
the most extreme cases, help shepherd its path to municipal 
bankruptcy. Our final goal was to investigate the types of 
“causal stories” (Stone, 2011) that state officials and experts 
used when considering the fiscal conditions facing their 
local governments. We held structured discussions about 
how the problem of local fiscal distress is defined (i.e., who 
or what bears the responsibility) and the ways in which 
state governments enshrine this problem definition via the 
design and implementation of financial emergency policies. 

In what follows, we begin with a brief outline of Michigan’s 
approach to local financial emergencies, paying special 
attention to linkages between the state’s policy solutions, 
the nature of fiscal stress in Michigan’s municipalities 
and the “front-end” context identified in Section 1. We 
then turn to alternative approaches employed in other key 
states. We begin with North Carolina, a state whose Local 
Government Commission, which administers the policy 
for dealing with financially challenged communities, has 
received a great deal of national credit. We then move 
to states facing more comparable sets of local conditions 
- i.e., with many older, industrial and fiscally vulnerable 
local governments suffering from population and job 
loss - that also have a history of state intervention in 
fiscally distressed communities. The goal here is not 
comprehensive overview. Rather, we set out to identify 
key dissimilarities with the new generation of intervention 
policies - of which Michigan’s current policy is the poster 
child - and to illustrate how state governments facing 
similar sets of challenges can more effectively align their 
policy regarding direct involvement in fiscally distressed 
communities with the nature of problems that these 
communities face, as well as with state-imposed constraints 
that hamper their capacity to balance revenue and 
expenditure flows. 

We designed Table 3 (see page 18) to help guide this 
discussion. The first two columns summarize the state 
context analyzed in Section 1 of this report. The four 
rightmost columns depict information summarizing the 
design and administration of the state’s local financial 
emergency policy. The column labeled “causal story” 
reflects our assessment of how a state government, via its 
legislation of state intervention, comes down on the debate 
over the causes of local financial failure. For some states, 
the focal point is internal causes - poor management, the 
incompetence of local leaders, political corruption, the 
dominance over policymaking by narrow interests, and/or 


“antidemocratic” structures and processes that favor the 
whims of local officials over the needs of local residents 
(Gillette, 2014b). Other states focus on forces external to 
local management - i.e., socioeconomic conditions that 
are at once causes and symptoms of diminishing local 
service capacity and resources (see Kimhi, 2008), such 
as high and concentrated poverty, older building stocks, 
residential vacancies, high crime, deep-rooted regional 
changes, population loss and job loss. The column labeled 
“policy approach” captures the gist of the state’s approach 
to financially distressed communities and reinforces the 
causal theory behind the policy’s design. We also include 
information on the administration of the states’ policies. 
Here the focus is on the powers of key administrative actors 
and their bureaucratic location. In line with a great deal of 
research on policy analysis and the policymaking process, 
we structure Table 3 in a way that suggests that key state 
decisions on goals, administration and implementation flow 
from how responsibility for the problem is assigned - i.e., 
the causal story (see Stone, 2011, p. 206). This information 
is provided for the six states that were represented at the 
Detroit workshop - Michigan, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio - as well as for North 
Carolina, a state that frequently gains attention for the 
effectiveness of its intervention policy. 

CD Michigan's Local Financial 
Stability and Choice Actt A Brave 
New World for State Intervention 

The tenets of Michigan’s intervention policy have been 
well-documented in research reports and news media. 

After the governor declares a fiscal emergency, 22 four 
possible courses of action are available to a municipality, 23 
though local takeover by an emergency manager (EM) is 
the most common course of action. This allows a state- 
appointed manager to “act for and in the place and stead 
of the governing body and the office of chief administrative 
officer of the local government” and effectively grants this 
individual powers beyond those available to local officials. 24 
Not only does he or she become responsible for all local 
fiscal decisions, including development and implementation 
of a recovery plan (which must be approved by the state 
treasurer), but the EM can also modify existing collective 
bargaining agreements, negotiate new union contracts and 
make personnel changes. The EM can also explore the 
option of consolidating services with another government 
entity, sell municipal assets and ask voters to increase the 
tax rate. The EM remains in this role until the city reaches 
certain benchmarks within its recovery plan, and a

the local unit of government to pay creditors or make timely pension 
contributions - prior to a state review of a local unit’s finances

receivership transition board is appointed by the governor 
to assist in transition until the official termination of 
receivership. 

The structure of Michigan’s successive intervention laws 
and the powers granted to the emergency manager point 
to a particular type of causal story - local government 
mismanagement as the chief barrier to fiscal solvency. The 
state’s solutions and assistance all center on correcting 
local decisions that led to chronic budget shortfalls, and 
the main focus of Michigan’s law, which is administered by 
the Department of Treasury, is to ensure a balanced budget. 
Efforts to achieve short-term fiscal solvency typically center 
on reductions in cities’ financial obligations - e.g., cutting 
pension obligations, making personnel cuts and contracting 
out services traditionally provided by local governments. 
EMs and other state officials have little leeway to affect the 
revenue side of local governments’ ledgers. As Anderson 
(2011, p. 620) argues, the viewpoint being expressed by the 
design and implementation of Michigan’s policy is “that the 
current revenue picture of the city is adequate to provide 
for public safety, debt service, and other core expenses — if 
only ... the city had competent management.” Indeed, little 
or no financial support accompanies state takeover. This 
is a telling feature of the state law that sheds considerable 
light on both the degree to which the policy oversimplifies 
the causes of local fiscal distress and the mismatch between 
the administrator’s toolkit and the nature of the problem. 

To respond to the question at the outset of this section: if 
takeover is the solution, the problem is mismanagement. 
Michigan codifies this causal story in a way that is less 
adulterated than in any other state we have surveyed. In 
other words, the state has adopted and codified a vastly 
oversimplified story. Even Rhode Island, which granted 
similarly sweeping powers to its state-appointed emergency 
managers, offers additional assistance to cities approaching 
distress to help prevent full-fledged crises. The state 
has also seen EMs (called “receivers”) raise local taxes 
to generate more local revenue. This less than favorable 
assessment of Michigan’s policy is buttressed by the 
absence of emergency bailout funding, a traditional feature 
of the more aggressively implemented state intervention 
policies (Berman, 1995; Anderson, 2011), as well as meager 
revenue-raising powers. EMs are empowered to tackle 
city expenditures as a means of bringing local budgets into 
equilibrium, but revenue-raising powers are effectively 
more limited than the powers normally afforded a city’s 
mayor or council member. As has been pointed out 
elsewhere, for cities such as Flint, Ecorse, Benton Harbor 
and Pontiac, this is a gross oversimplification of the 
structural barriers to fiscal sustainability (Doidge et al., 
2015). Our aim in this report is not to disprove the notion 
that mismanagement is the cause. We merely point out that 
the policy’s design and implementation features devalue 
the considerable constraints that the state places on the 
revenue capacity of local officials. 


C2) Ttte Limited Applicability of 
ss B@st Practices**” Why Adoption of 
North €ar©IIna*s Policies Won*t Work 
for Michigan 

The reentry of Michigan’s cities into emergency 
management and the number of local governments and 
school districts in trouble have led to suggestions that 
Michigan should look elsewhere for answers. 25 A Pew 
Center on the States report suggests that North Carolina’s 
monitoring system has prevented fiscal distress despite a 
history of crises during the Great Depression and some of 
highest unemployment rates in the country (Pew Charitable 
Trusts, 2013). 

The Local Government Commission, a division of the North 
Carolina Treasury Department, reviews cities’ independent 
audits on key fiscal health indicators, particularly the 
level of fund balance. If a locality fails to meet a specific 
threshold, it is placed on the commission’s watch report 
and required to submit a plan of improvement. If local 
officials are unable to return the municipality to an 
acceptable level on their own, the commission assumes 
control of all local financial decisions, including taxing 
issues, until the problem is corrected. Additionally, the 
commission approves and sells all local bonds for public 
structure investments, which both increases the level 
of state oversight and reduces the potential for local 
mismanagement of debt. Bond agencies assign a premium 
to this monitoring system, considering it a model system 
(Coe, 2007). 

Features of North Carolina’s approach provide intriguing 
options for Michigan lawmakers, such as a codified, 
professional state office and extensive front-end monitoring 
to identify potential crises. However, evaluating these 
policies in isolation - i.e., in the absence of key contextual 
factors - is likely to overstate the potential success of North 
Carolina’s policies if they were to be enacted in Michigan. 

For instance, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2007, 
North Carolina had 548 municipalities, no other local 
general-purpose governments and 100 counties; Michigan 
had 533 cities and villages (municipalities), 1,242 townships 
and 83 counties. A consequence of Michigan having three 
times as many local governments as North Carolina is that 
the volume of reports that would need to be reviewed 
for monitoring purposes would be three times as great. 26 
Certainly this would require more resources devoted to 
oversight at the state level, thus putting additional stress on 
the state budget. 

The states differ greatly on other dimensions of the 
elements of state context identified in Section I. North 

25 http://www.crcmich.org/PUBLICAT/2000s/2000/memol053.pdf. 

26 This does not include the additional resources that would be required 
to monitor school districts, special districts or other governmental 
units. 


19 



Carolina has an obligatory state pension system; Michigan 
does not. In 1947, North Carolina declared it illegal for 
local governments to bargain with unions. 27 Conversely, 
Michigan’s local governments have a strong history of 
collective bargaining and excluded police and fire unions 
from 2012’s right-to-work legislation. Tax and expenditure 
limits, when averaged from 1970 through 2005, rank 
Michigan as the third most restrictive state in limits placed 
on local governments. North Carolina is 38 th - a property 
tax rate limit on counties and municipalities, set in 1973, 
has remained its only TEL. 

The differences in the state policy context between the 
two states suggest that Michigan should be cautious 
when drawing lessons from North Carolina as its model 
for intervention policies. We attribute North Carolina’s 
success in preventing municipalities from entering distress 
not to the design of its specific intervention policy but 
rather to a much tighter link between its policy approach 
and the state-imposed context for fiscal distress. 

C3) Hebyildlng State-Leeai 
Partnerships" ICey Insights 
from Piiede island* New jersey* 
Pennsylvania* Mew Yorlc and Ohio 

One of the more striking findings to emerge from our 
workshop and subsequent research is the difference 
between Michigan’s approach to local fiscal distress and 
the approaches of comparably situated state governments. 
These differences are laid bare in Table 3. Plainly put, state 
policies and institutions effectively incubate budgetary 
imbalances; yet lawmakers and administrators have ignored 
potential front-end damage when designing the policy 
aimed at helping communities in distress. Rhode Island, 
the state most comparable to Michigan in the priorities 
of its intervention policy and the powers granted to state 
receivers, also provides financial assistance to municipalities 
most in need, targeting aid to communities with a high 
property tax burden relative to taxpayer wealth through the 
state’s Distressed Communities Relief Fund thus buttressing 
the revenue capacity of its local governments. 28 With 
respect to this specific aspect of state context, Rhode Island 
generally provides higher levels of state aid. 

New Jersey and Pennsylvania: A More 
Comprehensive View of Local Financial 
Failure 

Beyond Rhode Island, Michigan lawmakers have a variety of 
states from which to learn about the viability of policy 


27 N.C. Gen. Stat. 95-78 to 84 (http://www.nrtw.org/right-work-states- 
north-carolina). 

28 Established in 1990. Municipalities that fall in the bottom 20 percent 
of three of the law’s four indices qualify to receive state aid under the 
law. In the 2014 fiscal year, seven municipalities received funding 
through this legislation, a total of $10.4 million

alternatives. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have enacted 
receivership laws that are quite different than Michigan and 
Rhode Island. Internal mismanagement is not eschewed 
entirely; rather it is considered alongside the external, 
structural dynamics with which local lawmakers must 
contend. This more holistic causal story both reinforces 
and is reinforced by choices that these states have made 
regarding implementation and administration. 

New Jersey’s policy of assisting cities during times of 
financial crisis originated in the Great Depression. Since 
that time, the state has built support within its bureaucracy 
to review and approve city budgets and offer financial 
and technical assistance as needed to prevent cities from 
entering bankruptcy. Rather than appointing a state- 
level official to take charge of a city' s finances (such as an 
emergency manager in Michigan), 29 Newjersey seeks to 
assist local officials in alleviating distress. This partnership 
is reflected in the mission statement of the Newjersey 
Division of Local Government Services (DLGS), a division 
of the Department of Community Affairs. It states that 
the DLGS “serves as an advocate for local Government 
interests,” provides assistance and is responsible for 
“financial integrity.” The DLGS provides advisory services 
to local governments, both once the community is identified 
as distressed and on request of the municipality, and also 
licenses and educates local officials. 

Not surprisingly, these two services help establish a 
partnership between state and local officials independent 
of the financial position of the municipality. The state 
requires that all local government budgets and certain 
financing and purchases be approved by state agencies. 30 
The budget review is conducted by department staff 
members (many hired short-term annually) and is made 
easier for local units of government by state-provided 
training and consistent reporting requirements. When 
these preventive actions fail to ward off systemic financial 
issues, the state begins a more involved intervention. The 
community is first placed on a watch list, at which point 
the state generally channels additional monetary aid to the 
struggling government. The state also uses its Qualified 
Bond Act Program, which requires state approval to bond or 
make capital expenditures, to ensure stability and prevent 
default. This program can capture and stall state aid for 
payment of debt services. At the same time, DLGS offers 
technical assistance to cities to help them solve underlying 
problems that contribute to fiscal distress. 

The most notable example is the consolidation of the 
Camden police force in 2010. The mayor terminated the 
entire city police force and contracted with the county 
to provide those services, with the guidance and support 


29 Until recently, when Atlantic City was declared to be in fiscal distress 
and an emergency manager was appointed. 

30 Procurements over $5 million must be reviewed by the comptroller, 
and those over $10 million must be directly approved. 



of state officials. 31 Camden illustrates the cooperative 
efforts of various levels and sectors of the state and local 
governments. It highlights that preventive efforts to 
maintain or restore fiscal sustainability are not always 
sufficient, but that a collaborative approach can assist cities 
and the state through difficult political decisions. New 
Jersey’s approach indicates that the state views itself in 
partnership with local governments, with a responsibility 
to provide a check on risky financial decisions but also 
to provide ongoing financial assistance to struggling 
communities. 

In contrast to New Jersey’s hesitance to use direct state 
control, Pennsylvania’s Act 47 allows the state to place 
fiscally distressed communities in receivership under the 
direction of the Center for Local Government Services in 
the Department of Community and Economic Development. 
Once a municipality has been placed under receivership, 
local government officials must have the majority of their 
decisions confirmed by the receiver, and the receivership 
board may implement cost-saving or revenue-raising 
strategies unavailable to local officials. The board has the 
ability to raise taxes above the legal maximum but has no 
additional powers in collective bargaining. Principally, 
the receiver acts as a liaison between the local government 
and others to improve the financial integrity of the city and 
is typically able to broker additional state funding for the 
distressed community. In Harrisburg’s recent financial 
descent, for instance, the receiver was able to facilitate $25 
million of revenue to fund a non-profit that would provide 
infrastructure and economic development. 

Receivers in Pennsylvania tend to take a comprehensive 
view of local financial difficulties as they work with the 
state to look for alternative partnerships and unique 
revenue-enhancing and cost-sharing schemes. Proposed 
financial recovery plans often include recommendations 
that will improve local governments’ economic positions 
in the future. This approach extends through the process 
of recovery. It requires more research, more interactions 
and coordination between parties, and more time to allow 
for business adjustments and industrial reorganization. 
Furthermore, it includes a period of weaning cities off the 
additional funding to which they had access during their 
most trying times. To officially exit Act 47, cities must 
follow an extensive process that includes hearings and the 
department director’s signature. As a result, Pennsylvania 
has had only seven of 28 distressed communities officially 
conclude the process. Allowing cities to remain in a 
system with additional structure and support illustrates 
Pennsylvania’s acknowledgement that factors outside of 
local control contribute to fiscal issues, and that the state 
has some role in providing additional support. 

31 Returning to the role of other state policies in distress solutions, this 
action would not have been possible without particular provisions 
within union and employee contracts that allowed for such termination 
of individual employees. 


In all, intervention policies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania 
are administered by state agencies dedicated to working 
with local governments. State personnel are involved 
with municipalities well before distress, and they have 
resources and authority to assist municipalities. Though 
administrators are afforded the statutory authority to 
assume greater control over city finances, this is not the 
only facet of their relationship with local governments. 

New York and Ohio: The Benefits of 
Monitoring 

Similar to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, New York 
has established a system that supports state and local 
cooperation and information sharing. As local fiscal 
crisis deepens, the state becomes more involved in 
local political and operational affairs. The state’s policy 
approach to local fiscal emergencies is ad hoc\ (rather 
than multijurisdictional), allowing lawmakers to survey 
the specific causes of distress for a given community and 
legislate solutions in line with these problems. 

As is well-documented, New York’s history of fiscal 
intervention begins with New York City’s near bankruptcy 
in 1975. Naturally, a crisis of that magnitude spurred state 
action, but since that time, New York has not been plagued 
by chronic distress. This is due in part to cities’ ability 
to increase revenues without legal restriction (until 2014, 
when the state imposed a cap on property tax increases). 
Additionally, many New York communities have avoided 
the economic peril that results from a loss of major 
industries and subsequent economic restructuring. 32 This 
history is evident in the state’s view of municipal distress 
as an unusual and unique instance that requires customized 
solutions. New York provides gradual intervention and 
individualized approaches to distress, with the decisions 
and the process supervised by state elected officials - the 
governor, the legislature and the comptroller. 

In addition to customized intervention approaches to 
distressed cities - which could violate the constitutions 
of states that disallow special legislation - New York is 
also heavily involved in monitoring the fiscal position of 
its local governments. The state’s Local Government and 
School Accountability (LGSA) unit of the Office of the State 
Comptroller operates the Fiscal Stress Monitoring System, 
which reviews annual financial data of local governments to 
determine whether each government is facing significant, 
moderate or probable fiscal stress. Municipalities must 
submit audit reports, which are reviewed and in some 
cases conducted by approximately 200 auditors. 33 From 
annual reports, budgets and audits, the LGSA creates 
local fiscal measures for benchmarking, trend analysis and 

32 Buffalo was an exception and did necessitate intervention proceedings. 
It should be noted that Buffalo is one of only four New York local 
governments responsible for operating its own school district. 

33 These 200 employees review audit reports of school districts and other 
local governments as well as municipalities. 



general monitoring over time and across local government 
types. State auditors are also deployed to work with local 
governments. As a result, state officials may use knowledge 
of community nuances in evaluating local deviations 
from sound fiscal indicators and state trends. Such 
specialization is particularly useful as state intervention 
becomes necessary. 34 

If a local government is identified as financially unsound, 
the state must pass special legislation to institute a local 
control board for the municipality to engage in the formal 
intervention process. After a local control board is created, 
primary authority over the struggling municipality is 
transferred from the comptroller’s office to the governor' 
appointed board. 

Each board, by the nature of the process, has different 
powers. Previous boards have overseen proposed local 
budgets and set personnel policy, and were granted the 
final authority to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 35 That 
the boards have had no additional taxing authority, ability 
to renegotiate previous collective bargaining agreements 
nor authority to make unilateral budget decisions reflects 
the state’s emphasis on local autonomy. 

The boards have been particularly useful in coordinating 
intergovernmental solutions. For instance, the Buffalo 
Fiscal Stability Authority (BFSA) was established in 2003. 

It helped Buffalo manage its additional school district 
responsibility and restructured the city’s pension and 
health insurance plans by joining the respective state- 
level systems. Finally, the BFSA brokered an arrangement 
for city parks to be managed at the county level and for 
16 libraries to close. Despite the local knowledge and 
intergovernmental efforts, it took nearly nine years for 
Buffalo to exit receivership and for the BFSA to transition 
into an advisory role. Policy specifies that the BFSA will 
serve in this role until 2037, and the city may revert to full 
receivership if financial indicators show distress. 

At the state level, New York vests its relationship with 
local governments and the power to intervene in elected 
officials - the governor, the comptroller and the legislature. 
This separates the state’s ongoing monitoring from its 
intervention, and though it raises the legislative barrier 
to intervention by requiring the crafting and passage of 
legislation, it also provides public accountability and a 
system of checks and balances. The ability to draft city- 
specific solutions allows New York to address management 
issues, economic conditions and the impacts of the state 

34 Ultimately, any distressed community implements solutions that are 
specific to its condition. A universal policy prescription is to reduce 
expenditures. However, no universal prescription can be made 

on what account specifically should be limited and in what way. 
Knowledge of exact inefficiencies, redundancies, slack and so forth is 
necessary to act. If outside agents are to advise on such actions, their 
already having some knowledge of the particulars of the city will allow 
for more expedient and implementable recommendations. 

35 Control boards are not granted this authority for New York City.

context in different ways in each city, ideally assisting the 
community to long-term stability. 

Ohio, like New York, faced a fiscal crisis in its largest city 
in the 1970s. Cleveland’s default on short-term notes in 
1978, which made it the first municipality to default since 
the Great Depression, led Ohio to develop a comprehensive 
policy designed to prevent and, if necessary, intervene 
in distressed cities (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2013; Levine, 
Scorsone and Justice, 2013). No municipality has defaulted 
since Cleveland, but Toledo, East Cleveland and other 
municipalities have entered fiscal emergency status, 
particularly once the Great Recession exacerbated declining 
revenue bases and expenditure pressures. 

Ohio’s Local Government Services Division, located in the 
state auditor’s office, is responsible for training local officials 
and auditing local budgets. Chapter 118 of the state code, 36 
which deals with local fiscal emergencies, grants the Local 
Government Services Division (the auditor) responsibility 
for categorizing distressed communities for fiscal caution, 
fiscal watch or fiscal emergency. The categorization system 
signals to local officials, bondholders and other stakeholders 
the extent of the local government’s fiscal stress and the 
ease of financial recovery anticipated. It serves as a useful 
continuum of distress, recognizing that failing to pass one 
indicator of financial soundness may not require the same 
actions as a community failing multiple triggers. Each category 
has an increasing level of oversight (i.e., requirements for audit 
depth and financial plan proposals). Once fiscal emergency is 
declared, an advisory board is created. 

Under all three distress categories, local governments are 
required to submit recovery plans to the Local Government 
Services Division. If a local government is not compliant 
with its recovery plan, the only penalty is movement 
to a higher designation of fiscal distress. It is not until 
a municipality reaches the fiscal emergency status that 
penalties are imposed. 

As part of the fiscal emergency proceedings, municipal 
officials must submit a recovery plan to the recovery 
board for approval. If a plan is not submitted or the local 
government fails to adhere to a plan, the Office of Budget 
and Management is supposed to suspend all state funding 
to that municipality, 37 though this penalty has never been 
fully enforced. 

36 The other elements comprising the law became effective, were revised 
or added in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2002 - http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/118 
(pdf). The state’s approach is consistent with the autonomy allowed 
Ohio’s local governments. Section 118.02 (B) of the state code states 
that, “[t]he intention...is to enact procedures, provide powers, and 
impose restrictions ...while leaving principal responsibility for the 
conduct of the affairs...in the charge of its duly elected officials.” The 
effort to maintain local autonomy is demonstrated by the fact that the 
review process of the Local Government Services Division is initiated 
by request of local officials as well as at the suggestion of auditors. 

37 Although individuals receiving direct state welfare within the 
community’s borders continue to do so. 




Ohio, like other states, struggles with assisting 
communities to achieve permanent fiscal stability. The city 
of East Cleveland was under fiscal emergency for 18 years. 
Exiting the process failed to mark long-term sustainable 
success - East Cleveland was once again placed under 
fiscal emergency. In late 2014, it was considering entering 
into bankruptcy proceedings, 38 and the city’s mayor filed a 
petition seeking a merger with the city of Cleveland in the 
summer of 2015. 39

Ohio, like Michigan, illustrates the issues that arise when 
a state’s solution (intervention policy) does not match the 
causes of distress (context). Local officials retain control of 
decision making and the plan to resolve distress, but they 
and the state agency responsible for intervention lack the 
authority or resources to address the root causes of distress 
or to circumvent the pressures that the mix of state policies 
adds to local fiscal policymaking processes.

Section 3: Conclusions and 
Recommendations 


In the previous sections we identified the ways that broad 
state policies limit or enhance the local governing options 
and the ways that states with intervention policies match 
their approach to local financial distress with the reality 
of city operating environments. Here we conclude our 
analysis with conclusions and practical recommendations 
to assist the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
approach to local fiscal crises. 

CIIJ Conciysions 

There is no single model policy for state intervention 
in distressed cities or for prevention of fiscal distress. 
Changing Michigan’s fiscal intervention law to replicate 
that of another state would likely provide little 
improvement for Flint or other cities facing fiscal crises. 
There is no “best practice” for state intervention in cities. 
What Michigan can learn from other states and our research 
is that removing and repairing mismanagement addresses 
only one cause of fiscal distress. Bringing a structurally 
imbalanced budget back into balance is an important step 
to assist cities like Flint, but a policy that does not address 
a state’s unique system of revenue, tax and expenditures, 
and labor policies may not help cities truly escape financial 
trouble over the long term. States must decide which legal 
and political tradeoffs they are willing to make to support 
city fiscal health. Michigan must also recognize that, in 
comparison with similar states, it provides a particularly 
difficult environment for its cities. 

Municipal fiscal distress is not just a local problem. State 
policy choices set the boundaries for local action and the 
conditions under which cities receive assistance. It is not 
surprising that these conclusions do not point to simple 
solutions, executable at the local level. Changing any one 
part of the state context is politically challenging, and it 
would be impractical to recommend major policy overhauls 
of Proposal A, the Headlee Amendment, collective 
bargaining rules and state revenue sharing. Ideally, 
Michigan would adopt a more balanced approach to its 
local governments’ fiscal needs, but we are aware that this 
is unlikely in the short term because of both political will 
and the high barriers to changing constitutionally enshrined 
rules. Instead, we offer recommendations that balance 
improvements that would better support cities in fiscal 
distress with political feasibility. 

Mec@mmenoaii©iis 

Create a state agency that coordinates services to local 
governments and offers technical support and fiscal 


monitoring. Establishing a formal place within state 
government that is responsible for ongoing, cooperative 
work with local governments on fiscal stability and other 
issues would help create a partnership and culture of trust 
between the state and its municipalities. The Department 
of Treasury does provide some of these services on an 
individual basis via the Office of Fiscal Responsibility 
(OFR), but the OFR does not have the resources necessary 
to provide a comprehensive system of support to all of the 
state’s local governments. 

It is important that whatever agency is created be 
empowered with human resources to sufficiently provide 
service; financial resources, separate from the state’s 
revenue sharing to local governments, to offer special 
assistance where needed to communities facing challenges 
or distress; and a position within the state departmental 
structure that allows it to be taken seriously when 
recommending policy and working with other departments 
to assist local governments. The examples of offices in 
the other states in our study may provide elements of 
the agency’s design, but the office should be built with 
Michigan’s particular context and culture in mind. It may 
be appropriate to expand the OFR in its current position, 
but moving the office to another department, establishing 
it as a stand-alone agency and other potential structures 
should be evaluated as well. 

Raise awareness among citizens and state decision makers 
that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at the local 
level. Flint is an example that can illustrate this point as 
the C.S. Mott Foundation and city leaders communicate 
with the public and state officials. As the city emerges from 
state control, the budget is balanced for the short term, 
and the transition advisory board is in place to monitor 
management and compliance with the plan. Yet revenue 
projections show the city likely facing a structural deficit 
in the next five years with little available to cut from the 
budget. State control has reasonably removed management 
problems as the cause of deficits, yet the city’s fiscal 
health remains precarious. A focused communications 
effort highlighting the combined effects of Michigan’s 
expenditure, revenue and labor policies could help broaden 
the discussion of fiscal distress in the state and create 
awareness that this is more than a local problem. Rather 
than being the exception, Flint may be the harbinger of 
what is to come for Michigan’s local governments without 
changes at the state level.

We invited three types of individuals to participate in the Workshop on State Intervention in Distressed 
Communities held at Detroit’s Grccktown Hotel and Casino October 16-17, 2014: individuals who were for- 
mally involved in various elements of state intervention policy design and implementation, those involved 
in local fiscal distress and bankruptcy from a legal standpoint, and policy experts and researchers. The 
following table classifies the participants.

Session Title 


Outline 

Setting the Context |||!!!!!|| 

Surveying the causes and consequences of local fiscal dis- 
tress, with particular attention to the relatively weak posi- 
tion of local governments in the U.S, federal system: 

• Review of structural, economic, fiscal, intergovern- 
mental, institutional, and political causes 

• Local governments’ response to fiscal distress 

• State policies/institutions’ role in local fiscal capaci- 
ty 

• State policies designed to help local governments 
meet their financial problems 

State Intervention in Distressed Com- 
munities: The View From Michigan 

An in-depth view of Michigan’s approach to local fiscal 
distress through the eyes of those closely involved in the 
policy's design, implementation, and evolution 

A Deep Dive Into State Intervention: 
Policies on Paper v. Policies in Prac- 
tice 

A structured dialogue about the participants’ experiences 
with key elements of state intervention. 

• Stage 1: Getting in 

Where and when is pre-intervention support of- 
fered? How are distressed localities identified? 
When and how do local governments enter the 
program? How are decision criteria applied? 

* Stage 2: Developing a plan 

Who carries out the intervention? What actions 
may these actors take? What are the specific goals 
of intervention? What are the chief barriers to ef- 
fective implementation? 

♦ Stage J Exit strategy 

How does a local government exit the program? 
Are triggers well specified? When, if ever, are 
medium- and long-term fiscal, economic, or ser- 
vice-based objectives discussed?

Governor's Flint Water Advisory Task Force - Logistics Update 


Ladies and Gentlemen, 

This is to provide a brief update on some of the arrangements that we are making to conduct the work of the Governor's Flint 

Water Advisory Task Force (FWATF): 

• To simplify communications among task force members, the Task Force has decided to close the Basecamp project 
that was initially set up for the entirety of the roster provided earlier. The Basecamp project for the FWATF will be 
maintained for task force members. Accordingly, to archive documents for the FWATF's review and consideration, 
please e-mail to me (erothste@izr g- itd.com) or any one of the FWATF members and we will arrange for posting to 
Basecamp. If you have large documents or a large number of documents, please contact me and we can arrange for 
posting to Dropbox. 

o (This is why the project has not been accessible in the event that you have tried to load documents) 

• I thought it might be helpful for the FWATF to develop a brief status report on our activities — interviews and 
meetings conducted and scheduled, documents collected, etc. - perhaps on a bi-weekly or even weekly basis. So, 
unless there is objection or concerns, I will try to craft a reporting template for discussion by the FWATF at our next 
regularly scheduled meeting. If you have suggestions for this reporting, please send along. 

• We have put on our respective calendars a weekly meeting, generously hosted at PSC offices, on Wednesday 
mornings. We are also attempting to schedule a "listening session" in Flint in the next few weeks as well as briefing 
sessions with MDEQ and MHHS. 

My apologies for any confusion regarding the Basecamp set-up. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Importance:

Please see below and attached release per brief convo at senior staff. Sill no exact word on timing of blood lead level 
data from DHHS - hopefully by late this week. 

DEQ also has video that they'll be using for some footage of the testing with TV stations. Link here:

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 


i 



For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
conducted, visit www.michigan.gov/fiintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at knsztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, or by emailing

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 
assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 
provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 

As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water 
testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling 
results from Freeman Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even 
individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools 
and other buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. 
“Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing

school. These 1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the 
impact of any lead sources deep in the building’s plumbing. 



Talking Points on Freeman Announcement 


Q: How do we describe the home tests? 

A: The home tests are a surveillance-level screening tool. It is the same 
test used by the state to comply with the federal Lead and Copper Rule. 

Q: SO, a safe reading doesn’t mean my water is safe? 

A: A low reading means there are no fixture-related issues. This screening 
may not catch impacts of a lead service line to the home. If a homeowner 
isn’t sure whether they have a lead service line, the best way for 
homeowners to be absolutely sure is to have a certified plumber inspect 
their home. 

Q: Does home plumbing inspection mean they dig up my yard? 

A: Usually, no. A good plumber can usually assess the service line from the 
point of entry to the home. 

Q: Was the inspection of the schools done with a different kind of 
testing? If so, how so? 

A: Yes, the testing at the schools is a very thorough protocol designed to 
first determine if there are fixture-specific issues, then look deeper into the 
system to identify possible lead plumbing issues. 

Q: What was learned by the testing at Freeman Elementary? 

A: We identified 9 of 31 sites where the plumbing clearly was imparting 
lead into water. Importantly, we did repeated draws of the water at these 
spots over several minutes, and saw lead levels drop dramatically. This 
means the lead is in the fixtures, not in the water lines. It means the fixtures 
need to be addressed in some way - flushing for several minutes will help, 
but replacement of these fixtures offers a more permanent solution. And it 
means the water at Freeman is safe at 22 of the 31 sites inspected, which 
is of some reassurance to school officials. 

Q: The City is now using water from Detroit. When will the water be 
free from lead again? 



A: The water from Detroit is treated with phosphates, which coat the insides 
of lead home service lines and will reduce lead impacts. The City also will 
be adding additional phosphates to develop this coating more quickly, but it 
could take months for corrosion control to be achieved throughout the 
system. It is important to note that, even in systems where optimal 
corrosion control exists, lead components in home plumbing can still cause 
lead exposure. Removing lead from home plumbing is the only permanent 
solution to address lead in home water supplies. And testing is the best 
way to get an accurate sense of one’s exposure. In Flint, blood testing for 
children is free, and surveillance testing of water for any resident also is 
free.

Resources Defense Council (NRDC), nonprofit citizens’ organizations and individuals 
working to secure safe drinking water for the residents of Flint, Michigan. Since April 2014, 
the City of Flint and Michigan state officials have failed to monitor and control for lead in 
Flint’s drinking water, and to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with lead 
testing and remediation, in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et 
seq. This letter provides notice pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(b)(l)(a) that we intend to sue 
the City of Flint; Rick Snyder, Governor of Michigan; Dan Wyant, Director of Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality; Nick A. Khouri, Treasurer of Michigan; Frederick 
Headen, Chairperson of the Flint Receivership Transition Advisory Board (Board); Brian

Concerned Pastors for Social Action is an association of religious leaders from more 
than thirty churches and ministries in the Flint area that has advocated for the rights of the 
underserved for nearly fifty years. Melissa Mays is a Flint resident whose family has 
suffered from serious health problems as a result of the City’s failure to provide safe drinking 
water. The ACTU of Michigan works in courts, legislatures, and communities to preserve 
the protections that our laws guarantee to all citizens. NRDC is a national membership 
organization committed to protecting public health and the environment and to reducing 
the exposure of all communities to toxic chemicals. These groups and individuals continue 
to be harmed by the violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act by the City and Michigan 
state officials, detailed below. 

I. City and State officials have exposed and continue to expose Flint residents to 

dangerous amounts of lead in drinking water 

A. The City, Emergency Manager, and State Treasurer chose the Flint River 
as a primary drinking-water source 

In the fall of 20 1 1 , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency 
in the City of Flint and appointed an emergency manager to take control of the City’s 
operations and finances. 2 Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and the City Council were stripped of 
all authority except as specifically allowed by the Emergency Manager, and the City was 
placed in state receivership. 3 Under Michigan’s Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act, an

Emergency Manager has “broad powers” to “rectify the financial emergency and to assure 
fiscal accountability of the local government.” 4 

While under control of the Emergency Manager, the City faced decisions about the 
future of its drinking-water supply. For fifty years, the City had purchased drinking water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit), which sources water from 
Lake Efuron. 5 In response to rising water rates charged by Detroit, in March 2013, the City 
Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a newly formed municipal 
water supply system. The KWA was planning to build a pipeline to distribute water directly 
from Lake Huron to mid-Michigan communities, including Genesee County, where Flint is 
located. 6 The City Council’s vote did not become effective until several weeks later, after 
both the Emergency Manager and State Treasurer approved the decision. 7 

The City’s contract with Detroit was set to expire in April 2014, at least eighteen 
months before the KWA pipeline was scheduled to be completed. 8 Faced with a year-and-a- 
half gap in the City’s water supply, the Emergency Manager declined to negotiate a short- 
term contract with Detroit and decided instead to use the Flint River as a primary drinking- 
water source. 9 The City had previously explored — and rejected — the Flint River as a 
primary drinking-water source. This is because the Flint Water Treatment Plant would have 
required fifty million dollars in upgrades to treat the river water and “produce finished water 
in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water regulations.” 10

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule, Flint’s water system 
could not use the Flint River as a water source without first obtaining approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The Lead and Copper Rule 
required MDEQ to approve both the City’s proposed addition of a new water source (the 
Flint River) and the long-term change in water treatment (from treatment through Detroit’s 
water plant to treatment at the Flint Water Treatment Plant). 11 In April 2014, MDEQ 
approved the switch to river water. 12 The City immediately began pumping Flint River 
water through the City’s distribution pipes and into residents’ taps. 

B. Dangerous lead contamination results from the City's switch to river water 

In the twenty months following the switch in water sources, residents’ drinking water 
has been at times cloudy, discolored, and foul-smelling. 13 Residents reported that they have 
experienced hair loss, skin rashes, and vomiting after drinking the water. 14 In the summer of 
2014, the City was forced to issue several boil-water notices after tap water tested positive 
for total coliform bacteria. 15 The City’s subsequent treatment of the water to kill disease- 
carrying pathogens resulted in elevated levels of total trihalo methanes, a disinfection 
byproduct that can cause serious health problems, including an increased risk of cancer. 16

Because Flint River water is also highly corrosive, dangerous amounts of lead began 
to leach out of pipes and into the City’s drinking water. 17 Lead in drinking water occurs 
primarily from corrosion of pipes and other plumbing materials that contain lead or lead 
solder. 18 The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to manage lead levels by 
controlling corrosion, which is often accomplished by adding corrosion-inhibiting 
chemicals. 19 Water systems must implement and maintain an “optimal” corrosion-control 
treatment program that “minimizes the lead . . . concentrations at users’ taps.” 20 

Flint did not consider how to control the corrosivity of the river water before 
switching water sources, nor did MDEQ require the City to implement any corrosion- 
control measures. Rather, beginning in April 2014, the City did not use any form of 
treatment to control corrosion. 21 The City waited until after its residents were drinking the 
river water to assess whether it posed a risk of increased lead exposure. MDEQ endorsed 
this approach. In June 2014, Flint’s water system initiated the first of two six-month 
monitoring periods to test tap water for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule; the second 
six-month period ran from January to June 2015. 22 During these monitoring periods, the 
water system used flawed testing methods that appear to have been designed to underreport 
the lead content of residents’ drinking water. 23

Flint’s monitoring data showed that some residents’ water contained lead at 
concentrations above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion (ppb). 24 These high 
lead levels put residents at risk of abroad array of serious, irreversible health effects, 
including cognitive impairment, kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. 25 When the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) learned of these high lead sampling results in 
February 2015, it notified MDEQ officials that the sampling results raised significant 
concerns about corrosion from lead pipes in Flint’s distribution system. 26 Nonetheless, 
throughout the monitoring periods, the City and MDEQ maintained that these high lead 
levels were isolated and that the data, taken together, demonstrated Flint’s compliance with 
the Lead and Copper Rule. 27 

C. Community advocacy and independent testing prompt long past due 
response from City and State officials 

As the City concluded its second six-month round of sampling in July 2015, and 
notified some Flint residents of elevated lead levels in their tap water, the community 
became increasingly concerned. A small coalition of local groups, including Water You 
Fighting For and Concerned Pastors for Social Action, began working with researchers at 
Virginia Tech to conduct their own lead sampling of Flint’s water. The Virginia Tech 
scientists found that ten percent of the more than 250 samples collected from Flint 
residences had lead levels of 25 ppb or more, well above the federal action level for lead. 28 
Several samples exceeded 100 ppb, and one sample exceeded 1000 ppb. 29 Though aware of 


24 See Mich. Dep’t of Envtl Quality, Lead and Copper Report and Consumer Notice of Lead 
Result Certificate for Community Water Supply (Aug. 20, 2015) (showing six samples with lead 
levels over the action level) (attached as Ex. 25); 40 C.F.R. § 141.80(c)(1).

the Virginia Tech sampling results, MDEQ officials continued to insist that Flint’s water 
was safe to drink. 30 

In September 2015, a medical study conducted by a local pediatrician confirmed the 
kinds of adverse health impacts that residents had voiced concern about for months: the rate 
of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels had nearly doubled since the City changed 
its drinking-water source. 31 State officials and the Governor reacted by “downplaying] and 
in some cases attempting] to discredit” the pediatrician’s findings, and dismissing citizen 
concerns as “near-hysteri[cal].” 32 

Subsequent testing by MDEQ revealed that at least four schools in Flint had lead 
levels in their drinking water above the federal action level. 33 At Freeman Elementary 
School, water tested had lead levels over 100 ppb, more than six times the federal action 
level. 34 This increase in lead exposure is particularly dangerous in Flint, a community where 
residents are already at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels and lead poisoning. 
Michigan ranks fifth worst in the country for harmful exposures to lead. 35 Tow income is a 
risk factor for lead poisoning, and more than a third of families in Flint live below the 
poverty level, three times the national average. 36 Children in Flint also face high risk of lead

exposure from lead-paint dust, as nearly ninety percent of Flint’s housing stock was built 
before 1978 (when the federal ban on high-lead paint went into effect). 37 

Finally, in late September 2015, the City abandoned its assertions that Flint’s 
drinking water was safe. Nearly seven months after the City first saw dangerously high 
levels of lead in some residents’ water, Flint issued a drinking-water advisory and called for 
state financial assistance to switch the water system back to Detroit’s supply. 38 Two weeks 
later, Governor Snyder requested six million dollars from the state legislature to reconnect 
the Flint water system to Detroit. 39 With additional funding from the City and a private 
foundation, the switch was completed in mid-October. 40 

Following the switch back to Detroit water, some government officials began to ask 
questions about what went wrong in the course of Flint’s change in water sources. 41 
Governor Snyder created a task force to review water management and testing in Flint, 42 
and EPA established its own task force “to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through 
regular conversations” with the City and MDEQ. 43 Governor Snyder has also announced

plans to launch an “education campaign soon to help schools statewide learn how to get 
their water tested” for lead. 44 

Despite this proliferation of task forces and campaigns, neither the City nor MDEQ 
has announced changes in the City’s lead monitoring practices in the wake of Flint’s public- 
health crisis. Rather, Flint and MDEQ have maintained that these practices are accurate 
and adequate, despite the near certainty that they are underrepresenting lead contamination 
in many of Flint’s high-risk homes. 

II. City and State officials are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Lead 

and Copper Rule 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act) authorizes citizens to sue any governmental 
entity “who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement” under the statute. 45 These 
requirements include the national primary drinking-water regulations for lead and copper 
set forth in the Dead and Copper Rule. 46 The Lead and Copper Rule obligates water systems 
to monitor and control for lead in drinking water. 47 

Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has failed to comply with the Lead and 
Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring water for lead, notifying the public of tap-water 
monitoring results, reporting monitoring results to MDEQ, and controlling corrosion from 
lead pipes. 48 These violations systematically result in the City’s underestimating lead levels 
in its drinking water, masking a public-health crisis. The violations are ongoing and likely to 
recur in the future: Flint’s water system presently is obligated to monitor for lead every six 
months, and there is no indication that Flint has changed or disavowed its inadequate 
approach to monitoring. 49

47 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 141.86. 

48 Flint’s water system is subject to the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule because it is a 
“community water system” not otherwise exempted from the regulations. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(a)(1), 
141.2. 

49 See Tamaska v. City of Bluff City, 26 F. App’x 482, 485 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Chesapeake Bay 
Found, v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, 844 F.2d 170, 171-72 (4th Cir. 1988)). A water system is required to 
monitor tap water for lead every six months if it (1) exceeds the action level for any monitoring 
period, or (2) “fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within tire range of values for tire 
water quality parameters specified by the State ... for more than 9 days in any six-month period.” 40 
C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). Flint’s water system failed to maintain applicable values of 
orthophosphate and/or pH designated as the optimal water quality parameters by MDEQ. In 
addition, had the water system conducted monitoring in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule 
during the January to June 2015 period, it likely would have exceeded the lead action level.

Under the Act, a “supplier of water” is “any person who owns or operates a public 
water system.” 50 The City of Flint owns Flint’s water system. 51 Upon information and belief, 
the State officials administering Flint’s receivership and the City presently operate Flint’s 
water system. As discussed above, Flint’s Emergency Manager exercised the authority of 
the local government in the place of Flint’s mayor and city council. The Emergency 
Manager managed the water system and conducted its affairs, including making the 
decision to use the Flint River as a primary drinking-water source. 52 In April 2015, 

Governor Snyder removed the Emergency Manager and appointed a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board to oversee the City’s affairs until the receivership is terminated. 53 
The Board has control over the City’s budget, and must approve all decisions adopted by the 
City Council. 54 The Michigan Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act requires the State 
Treasurer to sit on a receivership transition advisory board for any municipality for which 
the governor appoints such a board, and Governor Snyder has appointed the State Treasurer 
(or his designee) to chair Flint’s Board. 55 The City Administrator reports to the Board, 
manages the City’s daily administrative operations, and directs City department heads in 
carrying out the daily activities of the City. 56 To date, the City remains in receivership, and 
its actions remain subject to approval of the Board. 57

and Beverly Walker-Griffea, Members of the Board; and Natasha Henderson, Flint City 
Administrator, are responsible for the violations of the Act by Flint’s water system which 
have endangered and will continue to endanger the health of Flint’s residents. 

A. Flint's water system is in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule's tap- 
water monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements 

The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify a pool of sampling 
sites prior to the commencement of a monitoring period. 58 This requirement is designed to 
target residences at high risk of lead contamination in drinking water, such as homes served 
by lead service lines. 59 In violation of the Rule, Flint’s water system does not select sampling 
sites for lead monitoring based on a pre-established sampling pool. For Flint’s most recent 
completed monitoring period, January- June 2015, the Director of the City’s Department of 
Public Works admitted that Flint “thr[ew] bottles out everywhere just to collect as many 
[samples] as we can, to try and hit our number.” 60 Similarly, email correspondence shows 
that the City has, during several monitoring periods, asked its own employees to submit tap- 
water samples, without regard to whether the employees were part of a pre-selected 
sampling pool. 61 

Under the Lead and Copper Rule, water systems that contain lead service lines also 
must draw fifty percent of their tap-water samples from sites served by a lead service line. 62 
Flint’s water system does not comply with this requirement. The water system reported to 
MDEQ that all the sample sites it used during the January-June 2015 monitoring period 
were residences served by lead service lines. 63 Flint’s Utilities Administrator, however, 
admitted that he was not able to verify that all homes sampled were served by lead service 
lines. 64 This is because City records concerning the locations of lead service lines in the 
distribution system are stored on 45,000 paper notecards. Flint began converting these 
notecards into an electronic spreadsheet this fall, well after the January-June 2015 
monitoring period. 65

Flint’s water system has also failed to sample the same sites across monitoring 
periods or document the reasons for declining to sample the same sites, as the Lead and 
Copper Rule requires. 66 Sampling new sites from one monitoring period to the next is 
permitted only if a site “is no longer accessible” to the water system or “no longer fits the 
requirements of a priority site.” 67 Records show that in the January-June 2015 monitoring 
period, Flint’s water system retested only thirteen of the one hundred sites it sampled in the 
previous monitoring period. 68 It did not provide the required explanation for these 
departures from the previous monitoring period’s sampling sites. 69 Upon information and 
belief, Flint’s water system concentrated its monitoring in areas where it anticipated low 
lead levels, due to recent infrastructure improvements, and selectively retested sites that had 
previously yielded low lead levels. Such selective sampling violates the Lead and Copper 
Rule’s intention that water systems “do not use only those sampling locations with the 
lowest lead or copper levels.” 70 

Flint’s instructions to residents for the collection of tap-water samples also violate the 
Lead and Copper Rule. The Rule allows residents to collect the tap-water samples used to 
monitor lead in drinking water, so long as the water system instructs residents of the 
sampling procedures required by the regulations. 71 Tap-water samples must be “first-draw 
samples,” meaning that the sample must be collected after water in the tap has stood 
motionless in the plumbing system for at least six hours. 72 Flint’s instructions direct 
residents to flush their taps for five minutes prior to letting the water sit for the six required 
hours. This “pre-flushing” has been shown to “result in the minimization of lead capture 
and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water.” 73 The water system’s pre- 
flush instruction “negates the intent of the [Lead and Copper Rule] to collect compliance

samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions,” 74 and goes “against the intent of the monitoring 
protocol, since it changes the normal water use of the homeowners in the sample.” 75 

Flint’s water system is violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s reporting requirements 
by representing to MDEQ that Flint’s monitoring practices are in compliance with the Rule. 
The City’s water system did not provide documentation to MDEQ justifying its selection of 
new sample sites in the January-June 2015 monitoring period, and, upon information and 
belief, is not accurately reporting information concerning whether sampled sites meet 
required regulatory criteria. 76 

The Lead and Copper Rule also requires Flint’s water system to notify each resident 
whose tap water was sampled of the lead results. 77 Upon information and belief, Flint has 
failed and continues to fail to properly notify all residents whose tap water was tested for 
lead of the individual monitoring results. 

B. Flint's water system has failed to maintain optimal corrosion-control 
treatment 

The Lead and Copper Rule required all large public water systems, including Flint’s 
water system, to install an “optimal corrosion control treatment” program by January 1 , 

199 7. 78 After a system has optimized its corrosion-control treatment, the regulations require 
the system to “continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 79 
Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has not maintained an optimal corrosion-control 
treatment program. Historically, the water system complied with the corrosion-control 
requirements by purchasing treated water from Detroit. When Flint switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, it did nothing to treat the Flint River water to 
control corrosion. This failure to maintain optimized corrosion control violates the Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

Although Flint’s water system has resumed its purchase of treated water from 
Detroit, it has not disavowed its erroneous interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule’s 
corrosion-control requirements. Nor has it committed to maintaining optimized corrosion 
control when it switches water sources again this summer to the KWA pipeline. Flint’s 
water system’s failure to maintain an optimized corrosion-control treatment program is 
likely to recur in the future.

III. The State of Michigan's failure to maintain a schools testing and remediation 
program violates the Safe Drinking Water Act 

The Act requires each state to establish a program “to assist” schools and day care 
centers in “testing for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water.” 80 Test results 
must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 81 Michigan, 
upon information and belief, does not maintain a program for school lead testing, 
remediation, and notification. 82 Accordingly, Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Wyant 
are presently in violation of the Act’s schools provision. 83 

IV. Intent to Sue 

The City of Flint and Michigan state officials have been and continue to be in 
violation of the Tead and Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring and sampling tap 
water for lead, notifying the public of and reporting to the State tap-water monitoring 
results, and corrosion control. Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant are in 
violation of the Act’s requirement to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with 
testing and remediating lead in school drinking water. These violations are likely to 
continue and to recur in the future absent a judicial decree ordering City and State officials 
to comply with the Act. If the City of Flint and the Michigan state officials identified above 
fail to cure their noncompliance with the Act within sixty days, Concerned Pastors for 
Social Action, Melissa Mays, ACLU of Michigan, and NRDC will file suit in federal 
district court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and litigation costs, as appropriate.

Natural Resources Defense Council, today announced their intention to sue state and city officials for 
ongoing violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act amid the city’s widespread lead-contamination 
crisis. A lawsuit would force officials to address repeated, systemic failures to follow federal rules 
designed to protect the public health from dangerous levels of lead exposure. 


l 



“The community of Flint is strong and united in our commitment to repair the harm lead exposure has 
inflicted on our children and families. We are taking a stand so that our community can heal the damage 
that has been done and work together so that justice can prevail,” said Pastor Allen Overton, a leader of 
the Concerned Pastors for Social Action. 

“This action is about holding the government accountable for failing to protect the public health of an 
entire community,” said Anjali Waikar, an environmental justice staff attorney at the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. “This case also highlights a troubling trend in which the government is willing to cut 
costs at the expense of its most vulnerable citizens,” Waikar said. 

“In their short-sighted effort to save a buck, the leaders who were supposed to be protecting Flint’s 
citizens instead left them exposed to dangerously high levels of lead contamination,” said Michael 
Steinberg, legal director for the ACLU of Michigan. “Not only were the city and state’s actions dangerous 
and misguided. They were illegal, too.” 

Dangerous amounts of lead leached out of the city’s pipes and into the drinking water of Flint’s homes 
and schools for more than a year following a decision by Flint officials to eschew Detroit's water supply in 
favor of using the Flint River as the City’s primary drinking water source. Not long after the switch, 
residents began to complain about the smell and discoloration of the water and, later, physical ailments 
stemming from the tainted water. 

Officials working on behalf of Flint insisted for several months that the water was safe. However, water 
tests conducted by experts from Virginia Tech proved those assurances to be wrong, and a study by a 
local pediatrician that showed that the proportion of Flint kids with elevated blood lead levels had doubled 
since the City switched water sources. After officials could no longer deny that the community’s drinking 
water was contaminated, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder finally conceded that Flint should stop using the 
river water and return to the Detroit water system. 

Despite this move, though, city and state officials have continued to violate federal legal requirements for 
monitoring and sampling tap water for lead, notifying the public about water-testing results and 
maintaining corrosion control from Flint’s lead pipes. 

"So much irreparable harm has been done as a direct result of the failures and lack of oversight 
perpetrated by the City of Flint and Michigan officials who are the very people we relied on to keep us 
safe. This lawsuit gives me hope that this will stop and no other city will have to endure the physical, 
property, and emotional damage that Flint residents have," said Melissa Mays of Water You Fighting For, 
a Flint-based organization. 

There is no safe level of lead exposure. The toxic effects of lead on virtually every system in the body, 
and particularly on the developing brains of young children, are well documented. It can also contribute to 
high blood pressure and other health problems in adults. Even low levels of lead in the blood have been 
shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue was served on behalf of Concerned Pastors for Social Action, an association 
of religious leaders from Flint; Melissa Mays, a Flint resident; the ACLU of Michigan; and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. The groups assert that since April 2014, the City of Flint and Michigan state 
officials have failed to monitor and control for lead in Flint’s drinking water and maintain a program to 
assist Michigan schools with lead testing and remediation, in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water 
Act. If City of Flint and Michigan state officials - including Governor Rick Snyder and Dan Wyant, Director 
of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality - do not remedy violations under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act within sixty days, the groups intend to file a lawsuit in federal court. 

Flint and state officials have known since 201 1 that choosing the Flint River as a drinking water source 
could result in lead contamination issues, due to its highly corrosive properties. Yet state and city officials 
insisted that the water was safe to drink - even after testing found dangerously high lead levels in some 
residents’ tap water. Citizen concerns about high lead levels were dismissed by state and city officials as 
“near hysterical]” and “irresponsible,” despite well-established evidence that there is no safe level of lead 
exposure, and that even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay 
attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible.

Residents of Flint, Michigan, to Sue City, State over Lead in Drinking Water 


Natural Resources Defense Council, ACLU of Michigan Start Legal Process to Stop Ongoing Violations of

CHICAGO (November 16, 2015) - Residents of Flint, Mich., together with the ACLU of Michigan and the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, today announced their intention to sue state and city officials for 
ongoing violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act amid the city’s widespread lead-contamination

I. City and State officials have exposed and continue to expose Flint residents to 

dangerous amounts of lead in drinking water 

A. The City, Emergency Manager, and State Treasurer chose the Flint River 
as a primary drinking-water source 

In the fall of 20 1 1 , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency 
in the City of Flint and appointed an emergency manager to take control of the City’s 
operations and finances. 2 Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and the City Council were stripped of 
all authority except as specifically allowed by the Emergency Manager, and the City was 
placed in state receivership. 3 Under Michigan’s Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act, an

Emergency Manager has “broad powers” to “rectify the financial emergency and to assure 
fiscal accountability of the local government.” 4 

While under control of the Emergency Manager, the City faced decisions about the 
future of its drinking-water supply. For fifty years, the City had purchased drinking water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit), which sources water from 
Lake Efuron. 5 In response to rising water rates charged by Detroit, in March 2013, the City 
Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a newly formed municipal 
water supply system. The KWA was planning to build a pipeline to distribute water directly 
from Lake Huron to mid-Michigan communities, including Genesee County, where Flint is 
located. 6 The City Council’s vote did not become effective until several weeks later, after 
both the Emergency Manager and State Treasurer approved the decision. 7 

The City’s contract with Detroit was set to expire in April 2014, at least eighteen 
months before the KWA pipeline was scheduled to be completed. 8 Faced with a year-and-a- 
half gap in the City’s water supply, the Emergency Manager declined to negotiate a short- 
term contract with Detroit and decided instead to use the Flint River as a primary drinking- 
water source. 9 The City had previously explored — and rejected — the Flint River as a 
primary drinking-water source. This is because the Flint Water Treatment Plant would have 
required fifty million dollars in upgrades to treat the river water and “produce finished water 
in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water regulations.” 10

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule, Flint’s water system 
could not use the Flint River as a water source without first obtaining approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The Lead and Copper Rule 
required MDEQ to approve both the City’s proposed addition of a new water source (the 
Flint River) and the long-term change in water treatment (from treatment through Detroit’s 
water plant to treatment at the Flint Water Treatment Plant). 11 In April 2014, MDEQ 
approved the switch to river water. 12 The City immediately began pumping Flint River 
water through the City’s distribution pipes and into residents’ taps. 

B. Dangerous lead contamination results from the City's switch to river water 

In the twenty months following the switch in water sources, residents’ drinking water 
has been at times cloudy, discolored, and foul-smelling. 13 Residents reported that they have 
experienced hair loss, skin rashes, and vomiting after drinking the water. 14 In the summer of 
2014, the City was forced to issue several boil-water notices after tap water tested positive 
for total coliform bacteria. 15 The City’s subsequent treatment of the water to kill disease- 
carrying pathogens resulted in elevated levels of total trihalo methanes, a disinfection 
byproduct that can cause serious health problems, including an increased risk of cancer. 16

Because Flint River water is also highly corrosive, dangerous amounts of lead began 
to leach out of pipes and into the City’s drinking water. 17 Lead in drinking water occurs 
primarily from corrosion of pipes and other plumbing materials that contain lead or lead 
solder. 18 The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to manage lead levels by 
controlling corrosion, which is often accomplished by adding corrosion-inhibiting 
chemicals. 19 Water systems must implement and maintain an “optimal” corrosion-control 
treatment program that “minimizes the lead . . . concentrations at users’ taps.” 20 

Flint did not consider how to control the corrosivity of the river water before 
switching water sources, nor did MDEQ require the City to implement any corrosion- 
control measures. Rather, beginning in April 2014, the City did not use any form of 
treatment to control corrosion. 21 The City waited until after its residents were drinking the 
river water to assess whether it posed a risk of increased lead exposure. MDEQ endorsed 
this approach. In June 2014, Flint’s water system initiated the first of two six-month 
monitoring periods to test tap water for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule; the second 
six-month period ran from January to June 2015. 22 During these monitoring periods, the 
water system used flawed testing methods that appear to have been designed to underreport 
the lead content of residents’ drinking water. 23

Flint’s monitoring data showed that some residents’ water contained lead at 
concentrations above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion (ppb). 24 These high 
lead levels put residents at risk of abroad array of serious, irreversible health effects, 
including cognitive impairment, kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. 25 When the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) learned of these high lead sampling results in 
February 2015, it notified MDEQ officials that the sampling results raised significant 
concerns about corrosion from lead pipes in Flint’s distribution system. 26 Nonetheless, 
throughout the monitoring periods, the City and MDEQ maintained that these high lead 
levels were isolated and that the data, taken together, demonstrated Flint’s compliance with 
the Lead and Copper Rule. 27 

C. Community advocacy and independent testing prompt long past due 
response from City and State officials 

As the City concluded its second six-month round of sampling in July 2015, and 
notified some Flint residents of elevated lead levels in their tap water, the community 
became increasingly concerned. A small coalition of local groups, including Water You 
Fighting For and Concerned Pastors for Social Action, began working with researchers at 
Virginia Tech to conduct their own lead sampling of Flint’s water. The Virginia Tech 
scientists found that ten percent of the more than 250 samples collected from Flint 
residences had lead levels of 25 ppb or more, well above the federal action level for lead. 28 
Several samples exceeded 100 ppb, and one sample exceeded 1000 ppb. 29 Though aware of

Result Certificate for Community Water Supply (Aug. 20, 2015) (showing six samples with lead

the Virginia Tech sampling results, MDEQ officials continued to insist that Flint’s water 
was safe to drink. 30 

In September 2015, a medical study conducted by a local pediatrician confirmed the 
kinds of adverse health impacts that residents had voiced concern about for months: the rate 
of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels had nearly doubled since the City changed 
its drinking-water source. 31 State officials and the Governor reacted by “downplaying] and 
in some cases attempting] to discredit” the pediatrician’s findings, and dismissing citizen 
concerns as “near-hysteri[cal].” 32 

Subsequent testing by MDEQ revealed that at least four schools in Flint had lead 
levels in their drinking water above the federal action level. 33 At Freeman Elementary 
School, water tested had lead levels over 100 ppb, more than six times the federal action 
level. 34 This increase in lead exposure is particularly dangerous in Flint, a community where 
residents are already at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels and lead poisoning. 
Michigan ranks fifth worst in the country for harmful exposures to lead. 35 Tow income is a 
risk factor for lead poisoning, and more than a third of families in Flint live below the 
poverty level, three times the national average. 36 Children in Flint also face high risk of lead

exposure from lead-paint dust, as nearly ninety percent of Flint’s housing stock was built 
before 1978 (when the federal ban on high-lead paint went into effect). 37 

Finally, in late September 2015, the City abandoned its assertions that Flint’s 
drinking water was safe. Nearly seven months after the City first saw dangerously high 
levels of lead in some residents’ water, Flint issued a drinking-water advisory and called for 
state financial assistance to switch the water system back to Detroit’s supply. 38 Two weeks 
later, Governor Snyder requested six million dollars from the state legislature to reconnect 
the Flint water system to Detroit. 39 With additional funding from the City and a private 
foundation, the switch was completed in mid-October. 40 

Following the switch back to Detroit water, some government officials began to ask 
questions about what went wrong in the course of Flint’s change in water sources. 41 
Governor Snyder created a task force to review water management and testing in Flint, 42 
and EPA established its own task force “to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through 
regular conversations” with the City and MDEQ. 43 Governor Snyder has also announced

plans to launch an “education campaign soon to help schools statewide learn how to get 
their water tested” for lead. 44 

Despite this proliferation of task forces and campaigns, neither the City nor MDEQ 
has announced changes in the City’s lead monitoring practices in the wake of Flint’s public- 
health crisis. Rather, Flint and MDEQ have maintained that these practices are accurate 
and adequate, despite the near certainty that they are underrepresenting lead contamination 
in many of Flint’s high-risk homes. 

II. City and State officials are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Lead 

and Copper Rule 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act) authorizes citizens to sue any governmental 
entity “who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement” under the statute. 45 These 
requirements include the national primary drinking-water regulations for lead and copper 
set forth in the Dead and Copper Rule. 46 The Lead and Copper Rule obligates water systems 
to monitor and control for lead in drinking water. 47 

Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has failed to comply with the Lead and 
Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring water for lead, notifying the public of tap-water 
monitoring results, reporting monitoring results to MDEQ, and controlling corrosion from 
lead pipes. 48 These violations systematically result in the City’s underestimating lead levels 
in its drinking water, masking a public-health crisis. The violations are ongoing and likely to 
recur in the future: Flint’s water system presently is obligated to monitor for lead every six 
months, and there is no indication that Flint has changed or disavowed its inadequate 
approach to monitoring. 49 


44 See Lori Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 13,

47 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 141.86. 

48 Flint’s water system is subject to the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule because it is a 
“community water system” not otherwise exempted from the regulations. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(a)(1), 
141.2. 

49 See Tamaska v. City of Bluff City, 26 F. App’x 482, 485 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Chesapeake Bay 
Found, v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, 844 F.2d 170, 171-72 (4th Cir. 1988)). A water system is required to 
monitor tap water for lead every six months if it (1) exceeds the action level for any monitoring 
period, or (2) “fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within tire range of values for tire 
water quality parameters specified by the State ... for more than 9 days in any six-month period.” 40 
C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). Flint’s water system failed to maintain applicable values of 
orthophosphate and/or pH designated as the optimal water quality parameters by MDEQ. In 
addition, had the water system conducted monitoring in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule 
during the January to June 2015 period, it likely would have exceeded the lead action level.

Under the Act, a “supplier of water” is “any person who owns or operates a public 
water system.” 50 The City of Flint owns Flint’s water system. 51 Upon information and belief, 
the State officials administering Flint’s receivership and the City presently operate Flint’s 
water system. As discussed above, Flint’s Emergency Manager exercised the authority of 
the local government in the place of Flint’s mayor and city council. The Emergency 
Manager managed the water system and conducted its affairs, including making the 
decision to use the Flint River as a primary drinking-water source. 52 In April 2015, 

Governor Snyder removed the Emergency Manager and appointed a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board to oversee the City’s affairs until the receivership is terminated. 53 
The Board has control over the City’s budget, and must approve all decisions adopted by the 
City Council. 54 The Michigan Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act requires the State 
Treasurer to sit on a receivership transition advisory board for any municipality for which 
the governor appoints such a board, and Governor Snyder has appointed the State Treasurer 
(or his designee) to chair Flint’s Board. 55 The City Administrator reports to the Board, 
manages the City’s daily administrative operations, and directs City department heads in 
carrying out the daily activities of the City. 56 To date, the City remains in receivership, and 
its actions remain subject to approval of the Board. 57

and Beverly Walker-Griffea, Members of the Board; and Natasha Henderson, Flint City 
Administrator, are responsible for the violations of the Act by Flint’s water system which 
have endangered and will continue to endanger the health of Flint’s residents. 

A. Flint's water system is in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule's tap- 
water monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements 

The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify a pool of sampling 
sites prior to the commencement of a monitoring period. 58 This requirement is designed to 
target residences at high risk of lead contamination in drinking water, such as homes served 
by lead service lines. 59 In violation of the Rule, Flint’s water system does not select sampling 
sites for lead monitoring based on a pre-established sampling pool. For Flint’s most recent 
completed monitoring period, January- June 2015, the Director of the City’s Department of 
Public Works admitted that Flint “thr[ew] bottles out everywhere just to collect as many 
[samples] as we can, to try and hit our number.” 60 Similarly, email correspondence shows 
that the City has, during several monitoring periods, asked its own employees to submit tap- 
water samples, without regard to whether the employees were part of a pre-selected 
sampling pool. 61 

Under the Lead and Copper Rule, water systems that contain lead service lines also 
must draw fifty percent of their tap-water samples from sites served by a lead service line. 62 
Flint’s water system does not comply with this requirement. The water system reported to 
MDEQ that all the sample sites it used during the January-June 2015 monitoring period 
were residences served by lead service lines. 63 Flint’s Utilities Administrator, however, 
admitted that he was not able to verify that all homes sampled were served by lead service 
lines. 64 This is because City records concerning the locations of lead service lines in the 
distribution system are stored on 45,000 paper notecards. Flint began converting these 
notecards into an electronic spreadsheet this fall, well after the January-June 2015 
monitoring period. 65

Flint’s water system has also failed to sample the same sites across monitoring 
periods or document the reasons for declining to sample the same sites, as the Lead and 
Copper Rule requires. 66 Sampling new sites from one monitoring period to the next is 
permitted only if a site “is no longer accessible” to the water system or “no longer fits the 
requirements of a priority site.” 67 Records show that in the January-June 2015 monitoring 
period, Flint’s water system retested only thirteen of the one hundred sites it sampled in the 
previous monitoring period. 68 It did not provide the required explanation for these 
departures from the previous monitoring period’s sampling sites. 69 Upon information and 
belief, Flint’s water system concentrated its monitoring in areas where it anticipated low 
lead levels, due to recent infrastructure improvements, and selectively retested sites that had 
previously yielded low lead levels. Such selective sampling violates the Lead and Copper 
Rule’s intention that water systems “do not use only those sampling locations with the 
lowest lead or copper levels.” 70 

Flint’s instructions to residents for the collection of tap-water samples also violate the 
Lead and Copper Rule. The Rule allows residents to collect the tap-water samples used to 
monitor lead in drinking water, so long as the water system instructs residents of the 
sampling procedures required by the regulations. 71 Tap-water samples must be “first-draw 
samples,” meaning that the sample must be collected after water in the tap has stood 
motionless in the plumbing system for at least six hours. 72 Flint’s instructions direct 
residents to flush their taps for five minutes prior to letting the water sit for the six required 
hours. This “pre-flushing” has been shown to “result in the minimization of lead capture 
and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water.” 73 The water system’s pre- 
flush instruction “negates the intent of the [Lead and Copper Rule] to collect compliance

samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions,” 74 and goes “against the intent of the monitoring 
protocol, since it changes the normal water use of the homeowners in the sample.” 75 

Flint’s water system is violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s reporting requirements 
by representing to MDEQ that Flint’s monitoring practices are in compliance with the Rule. 
The City’s water system did not provide documentation to MDEQ justifying its selection of 
new sample sites in the January-June 2015 monitoring period, and, upon information and 
belief, is not accurately reporting information concerning whether sampled sites meet 
required regulatory criteria. 76 

The Lead and Copper Rule also requires Flint’s water system to notify each resident 
whose tap water was sampled of the lead results. 77 Upon information and belief, Flint has 
failed and continues to fail to properly notify all residents whose tap water was tested for 
lead of the individual monitoring results. 

B. Flint's water system has failed to maintain optimal corrosion-control 
treatment 

The Lead and Copper Rule required all large public water systems, including Flint’s 
water system, to install an “optimal corrosion control treatment” program by January 1 , 

199 7. 78 After a system has optimized its corrosion-control treatment, the regulations require 
the system to “continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 79 
Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has not maintained an optimal corrosion-control 
treatment program. Historically, the water system complied with the corrosion-control 
requirements by purchasing treated water from Detroit. When Flint switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, it did nothing to treat the Flint River water to 
control corrosion. This failure to maintain optimized corrosion control violates the Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

Although Flint’s water system has resumed its purchase of treated water from 
Detroit, it has not disavowed its erroneous interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule’s 
corrosion-control requirements. Nor has it committed to maintaining optimized corrosion 
control when it switches water sources again this summer to the KWA pipeline. Flint’s 
water system’s failure to maintain an optimized corrosion-control treatment program is 
likely to recur in the future.

III. The State of Michigan's failure to maintain a schools testing and remediation 
program violates the Safe Drinking Water Act 

The Act requires each state to establish a program “to assist” schools and day care 
centers in “testing for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water.” 80 Test results 
must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 81 Michigan, 
upon information and belief, does not maintain a program for school lead testing, 
remediation, and notification. 82 Accordingly, Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Wyant 
are presently in violation of the Act’s schools provision. 83 

IV. Intent to Sue 

The City of Flint and Michigan state officials have been and continue to be in 
violation of the Tead and Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring and sampling tap 
water for lead, notifying the public of and reporting to the State tap-water monitoring 
results, and corrosion control. Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant are in 
violation of the Act’s requirement to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with 
testing and remediating lead in school drinking water. These violations are likely to 
continue and to recur in the future absent a judicial decree ordering City and State officials 
to comply with the Act. If the City of Flint and the Michigan state officials identified above 
fail to cure their noncompliance with the Act within sixty days, Concerned Pastors for 
Social Action, Melissa Mays, ACLU of Michigan, and NRDC will file suit in federal 
district court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and litigation costs, as appropriate.

Ron, here’s the EPA link to its page on requirements for schools. 1 excerpted and bolded the important 
language. Schools that are part of a municipal supply don’t ha ve separate requirements. Those that ha ve their 
own building water supply are already subject to all the SDWA requirements. 

If there’s a requirement for education and outreach, perhaps DHHS would know. I’ve included them here to 
loop them In. 

Our folks are still looking into this, but the day is growing late. If I come up with something further, I’ ll share it

Please see below from Egan. This is essentially the same "?" Nancy Kaffer asked of Jeremy a couple weeks back. Intend 
to say something along the lines of the following.. .please advise. 


The Tucker-Young report offered an initial perspective on the situation, but as additional information was 
received and considered by the city, city officials determined that KWA offered the best long-term solution for 
Flint. As has been noted previously, all involved, the mayor and city council, believed the move to KWA was 
appropriate and supported the move. 

As we have discussed previously, consideration of the development of a Flint-area/Genesee County water 
system had been on-going since the early 2000's and the City of Flint had been in discussions about joining a 
new system for much of that time.

Terry attached is the City of Flint Water Supply Assessment, a February 2013 study commissioned by the state treasurer 
and carried out by Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull Inc. 

Why did the state and city opt to split with DWSD and go with KWA when this study found it would be more costly to do 
so? 

(From p. 17) "Based on the analysis, it is prudent to assume the KWA water supply option costs would be somewhere 
between the KWA-1 and KWA-2 options. Therefore, the analysis indicates that the two DWSD options 
of supplying 8 MGD on a maximum day and up to 8 MGD on average are the least cost options for Flint. 

These options allow Flint to maximize the use of existing assets; the City of Flint's (the Flint WTP) and 
DWSD's (the existing 72-inch main)."

Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. (TYJT), at the request of the State Treasurer performed an analysis of 
the water supply options being considered by the City of Flint. The City of Flint is presently supplied 
potable water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). This supply is from a single 
72-inch water main that terminates at a master meter located at Potter and Baxter. Additionally, 
downstream of the DWSD master meter, Flint supplies its customer Genesee County. The City of Flint 
also operates a water treatment plant that uses the Flint River as its source of supply to provide back up 
and redundancy to the DWSD supply as required by MDEQ. 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is planning on constructing a raw water supply system that 
could provide Lake Huron water to the Flint Water Treatment Plant. Flint's existing plant would be 
upgraded to treat the new raw water source. 

The State Treasurer has appointed an emergency financial manager for the City of Flint. As such the 
Treasurer has requested TYJT to provide an analysis of the water supply options to assist the Treasurer 
in determining any potential risk and the best course going forward for supplying potable water to the 
City of Flint. 


eport organization 


The following sections of this report are described below: 


Section 2 - The basis of the analysis is described in this section. The options include the KWA option and 
several options offered by DWSD. 


Section 3 - A significant amount of information and data was collected including memorandums, 
reports, drawings, financial reports, and other documents. This section summarizes the information 
used in the analysis. 


Section 4 - This section describes the evaluation of the cost of supply for the Flint options. The costs are 
comprised of the initial cost of operations plus the annual rate of escalation/inflation. 

Section 5 - The evaluation process used to analyze the construction costs associated with the KWA 
supply system is described in this section. Additionally, the cost of financing the capital requirements is 
described. 


Section 6 - This section presents the financial review of the options considered to supply potable water 
to Flint. A summary of these options is also provided. 

Section 7 - In addition to the financial analysis other considerations were identified that should be 
considered in understanding the risks and determining the best option to supply Flint. They include 
items related to cost, redundancy and reliability, and Flint's ability to control their future cost of water 
supply.

Two water purveyor options were evaluated; the KWA water supply system and continued supply from 
DWSD. Both suppliers would provide water from Lake Huron as the source. The KWA system is a raw 
water supply, which means that the water would have to be treated by Flint before distributing the 
potable water to its customers. The DWSD supply is potable or "finished" water and would not need 
additional treatment. 

Additionally, an option for the Flint WTP to supply the City of Flint without being supplied from either 
DWSD or KWA was initially considered. The preliminary investigation evaluated the cost associated with 
the required improvements to the plant and to the Flint River dam system. Although it appeared that 
this was a viable option, Flint in a meeting on December 20, 2012 with the Treasury, stated that the City 
did not want to pursue the option and it is no longer being considered. 


zgnondi Water Authority (KWA) Lake Huron Water Suppl 


The KWA water supply system schematic is shown in Figure 2-1. The system is comprised of an intake in 
Lake Huron that supplies water to the Lake Huron Pump Station (LHPS). The LHPS lifts the water and 
pumps it through an approximately 22 mile long 60-inch pipeline. The pipeline terminates at a 5 MG 
reservoir and is then pumped from the Intermediate Pump Station (IPS) through approximately 26 miles 
of 60-inch and 18 miles of 30-inch pipeline to the existing Flint WTP. Downstream of the IPS, 
approximately half way to the Flint WTP, the 60-inch line would also supply a new Genesee County WTP. 


The raw water transmission system has a 60 MGD capacity and is sized to deliver a maximum of 18 MGD 
to the Flint WTP with an average day supply of 12 MGD. Improvements at the Flint WTP would also be 
required to treat the lake water as the plant is currently designed to treat the Flint River water. 


The term of the KWA contract for Flint is 40 years. 




Figure 2-1: KWA Raw Water System 



The DWSD system schematic is shown in Figure 2-2. Flint is currently supplied by DWSD at Master 
Meter FL-1, located at Potter and Baxter. Flint typically gets its water from the Lake Huron WTP, located 
in Fort Gratiot, Michigan; near the Lake Huron shoreline. Water is treated and pumped at the Lake 
Huron WTP and supplied through a 120-inch pipeline to an intermediate pump station called the Imlay 
Pump Station. The Imlay Pump Station has 20 MG of reservoir capacity. Depending on the time of year 
and the DWSD system demand, water is either bypassed directly to Flint or it is re-pumped at Imlay. It 
should be noted that the DWSD supply to Flint is part of a very large water system and during 
emergencies or outages water can be supplied from the south up to Flint in lieu of the Lake Huron 
facility.

Figure 2-2: DWSD Water System 

The pipeline from Imlay to FL-1 is a 72-inch pipeline. It has been estimated that the 72-inch line serving 
Flint has a capacity in excess of 90 MGD. 

DWSD has presented several contractual options to Flint and all of them are based on Flint signing a new 
30 year contract. The options shown in Table 2-1 are based on two different supply points; one at the 
current master meter location FL-1 at Potter and Baxter (P&B) and the other at the location of the Imlay 
Pump Station. The reason for the varying options is to provide a lower water rate at the Imlay Station, 
since the DWSD rate formula is based on distance and elevation factors related to the supply location. 

The rates are also dependent on the maximum amount of water DWSD supplies. As example, if DWSD 
supplies a maximum day demand of 18 MGD that would equal the entire amount of water required by 
Flint. 

For the options less than the maximum of 18 MGD means that the Flint WTP would supplement the 
difference by supplying water treated from the Flint River. These options are known as "blending" and 
would allow for Flint to blend two sources of water to supply its customers; the Flint River using the Flint 
WTP and Lake Huron from DWSD system.

4 . COST OF SERVICE 

Information provided by DWSD, Flint, and representatives of the KWA were used in the cost of service 
evaluation. To evaluate the annual escalation/inflation rate over the planning period, the rate 
adjustment for DWSD was estimated based on the recent rate adjustment history. For the KWA system 
both the estimated cost of operations when the system begins supplying water and the annual rate 
adjustment or inflation was evaluated. The existing cost of operations and escalation for the Flint WTP 
was based on actual costs provided and then adjusted depending on the scenario considered. This 
section describes the evaluation process and the rates used in the analysis. 


DWSD Water Supply 

The City of Flint has been a customer of DWSD since 1967. The Flint WTP has been maintained as a 
backup to the DWSD system. As indicated previously, several options were provided by DWSD 
depending on the type of service Flint was to select. The unit cost of water for each of these options is 
shown in Table 4-1. These rates are based on DWSD's FY13, which are current until July 2013.

Table 4-1: Cost of DWSD Supply Options 


To determine annual escalation rate, DWSD's last 10 years of history was used along with other large 
urban water systems in Michigan. The water systems used for benchmarking comparison were: Lansing, 
Grand Rapids, and Saginaw. 


Table 4-2 identifies the annual and average rate of increase to Flint based on supplying water either to 
the current FL-1 at Potter and Baxter or Imlay. Note the last three years of the rates (FY 2011 through 
FY 2013) assumes that Flint's cost would be based on the new 30 year contract; FY 2011 being the first 
year that the new contract was available.

Table 4-3: O&M Inflation Rates of Other Large Water Systems 


Based on the information analyzed from DWSD and the other communities, it was determined that a fair 
annual rate of inflation for operations and maintenance cost for the analysis should be 4.4%. The 4.4% 
has historical significance from Flint's current water supplier and falls within the range of the other 
communities. 



The initial projected O&M cost for the KWA supply would be comprised of KWA's O&M costs as well as 
Flint's O&M costs. Because there was limited information provided, the initial estimated rate of 
$1.50/MCF was used. This rate is based on information from the cost comparison analysis attached to 
the letter to Mr. Kurtz, dated October 31, 2012. 

The KWA cost evaluation used an annual O&M inflation rate of 5%. To validate this rate a similar 
analysis to DWSD's operations and maintenance annual rate of inflation was used. First, in discussions 
with Flint and the Genesee County Drain Commission (GCDC), they believed that the annual rate of 
inflation for the new KWA system would be similar to the GCDC Water & Waste Services (WWS). 
Additionally, two large transmission systems were used to benchmark the inflation rates: the 
Southeastern Oakland County Water Authority (SOCWA) and the Ypsilanti Utility Community Authority 
(YUCA). Although both of these systems transmit finished water opposed to raw water, they were 
considered similar enough for comparison as they are comprised of only large water mains, pumping 
facilities and storage. 

Once again audited financial statements were used to calculate the inflation rates. A summary of the 
findings are shown in Table 4-4. Based on the fact that the information analyzed showed a large 
difference between the two systems, it was determined that the KWA assumption of 5% was a good rate 
of inflation to use in the financial analysis. This rate is almost equally between the GCDC rate and the 
other two transmission systems.

Table 4-4: O&M Inflation Rates of Other Comparable Systems to KWA 


The Flint WTP currently serves as a backup supply to the DWSD service to Flint. To maintain backup 
operations, the City of Flint operates the plant approximately 20 days each year. Flint indicated that the 
average production rate when they operate is 11 MGD. 

For the blending options and the KWA supply considered, Flint would be required to operate its plant all 
year around. Therefore, their operating and maintenance costs were evaluated and adjusted to 
determine an annual cost associated with year-round operations. 

The Flint WTP provided three years of operating costs for the assessment. Additionally, reports listed in 
Section 3 were also used as reference to determine both operating costs for the plant processing Flint 
River water (blending options) and Lake Fluron raw water (KWA option). 

Major cost centers were analyzed to estimate annual operation and maintenance. They included: labor, 
utilities, chemicals and residual management. In general, as recommended by the Flint plant staff, labor 
and overhead were increased from the current costs by two-thirds. Additionally, variable costs for 
power, chemicals and residual cost were increased to estimate full time treatment at the Flint WTP. 

Data from the KWA Preliminary Report and annual operating data for the Flint WTP (provided 
separately) were analyzed to make these forecasts. 

The annual operating and maintenance costs developed for Flint WTP used are shown in Table 4-5.

Lake Huron (Supplied by KWA) 12 $7,913,118 

Table 4-5: FY 13 O&M Costs for Year-round Operations 

It was determined that a fair annual rate of inflation for operations and maintenance cost for the Flint 
WTP plant should be 4.51%. The 4.51% is an average of Lansing, Grand Rapids and Saginaw facilities. 


11 



Large capital investments would be required by Flint and GCDC to construct the KWA supply system. 
Furthermore, some of the options presented by DWSD (supply point from Imlay) would require the 
purchase by Flint of DWSD's 72-inch water main. Performing the financial analysis; therefore, required 
an analysis of the KWA construction cost estimate for the transmission system and Flint WTP 
improvements. 

Revenue bonds were also identified as the source of financing the new supply system and associated 
improvements. This section describes the assumptions made and the interest used for financing the 
improvements. 



The most current cost estimate of the KWA system was presented in the document titled; Lake Huron 
Supply Study, KWA, Appendix 20, October 2012 Preliminary Report Update, Final Report (DRAFT), 
October 4, 2012. The cost of construction is estimated at $272,421,558. Flint's portion would be 30% or 
$81,726,467. 

Due to the significance of this expenditure, a detailed review of the cost was performed and is 
presented in this section. The analysis was performed based on the main elements of the supply 
system: the lake intake, the two pumping stations, and the transmission pipeline. Additionally, an 
analysis was performed related to construction contingencies and other costs such as engineering, legal, 
and administration. 


Lake 


KWA representatives indicated in a meeting in November that the design documents for the intake were 
at 90% and that it was planned for advertisement in January 2013. A summary of the estimate is shown 
in Table 5-1.

KWA representatives indicated that the pump stations were estimated at a level of design less than 15%. 
Therefore, in addition to an evaluation of their cost estimate, other water pumping station costs were 
used for comparison. Additionally, contractors were also contacted for costs. Table 5-2 summarizes the 
KWA cost estimate compared to our cost estimate performed for the Treasury.

Table 5-2: Pumping Stations Cost Estimate 


Two things to note regarding the difference in the cost estimates; firstly, there is a large difference in 
the cost estimates of the pumping stations. The estimate developed for the Treasury used several other 
pumping stations construction costs from Southeastern Michigan and discussions with contractors. 
These costs were then computed on a $/MG's for comparison. 


Secondly, our estimate for the Treasury is based on an ELAC of 30% instead of KWA's 25%. Although 
25% was acceptable for the intake, it is believed to be too low for the pumping station estimate given 
that the engineering effort is less than 15%. 


Transmission Main 

Although the specific route for the transmission main was not provided, an estimate was calculated 
based on the general information provided. Once again, the KWA estimate was based on a level of 
design less than 15%. The estimate performed for the Treasury used the line items provided by KWA for 
the pipeline and also consulted with contractors to evaluate the cost of construction. The comparison is 
shown in Table 5-3. 

Although the cost of construction of the pipeline is similar, a value of 30% was used for ELAC due to the 
level of design. Additionally, KWA did not believe there would be any additional costs for easements; 
however, this did not seem practical. Therefore an estimate for acquiring the easements was added to 
the Treasury estimate and is based on the 277 easements identified by KWA. The cost shown includes 
surveying, legal, engineering, administration, etc.

Other KWA Costs 


In prior estimates of the construction cost, KWA used an ELAC of 37%. In this case it could be 
considered that the engineering effort associated with the design would have been included. However, 
it is believed that KWA's reduced ELAC of 25%, does not include the design effort. Additionally, it would 
be prudent to assume that the owner would want a construction manager during construction of this 
large project. A summary of these costs are shown in Table 5-4.

Table 5-4: Other Costs 



A summary of the two cost estimates are shown in Table 5-5. Based on the comparison, the estimate 
performed by TYJT shows a higher cost to Flint by approximately $25,000,000. 

Note that there are two other costs shown in the summary that were not previously addressed; power 
and backup power. Regarding the cost of providing power to the pumping facilities, the cost of 
$4,000,000 appears reasonable. 


14 



The KWA has repeatedly indicated that backup power is not needed. Backup power is a standard 
practice in the water industry. Furthermore, a loss of power at either pumping facility will prevent the 
supply of water to both Flint and Genesee County. For these reasons, the cost of providing backup 
power was included in our estimate for the Treasury.

Table 5-5: Total Cost Comparison 



The KWA analysis identified capital costs required to convert the existing WTP from river water 
treatment to treating lake water. The cost estimate was identified as $7,100,000 in the 2009 report. 
This number was used in the our analysis, since additional information was not provided. For the 
purpose of the financial analysis; however, the $7,100,000 was increased by 3% each year for three 
years to account for inflation. 



The options identified by DWSD to supply service to Flint at the Imlay Pump Station would require Flint 
to purchase the 72-inch water main from Imlay to Master Meter, FL-1. The pipeline is approximately 25 
miles long. The estimated cost provided by DWSD for estimating purposes is $4,700,000. 



The cost of financing the revenue bonds for the capital work was investigated. Based on conversations 
with local financial advisors knowledgeable in bond financing, an interest rate of 5% for the 25 year 


15 



period was considered acceptable. This is based on a Standard and Poor's bond rating of A without 
insurance. 

Additional costs associated with the bond include the reserve and bond issuance fee. The bond holders 
will require a reserve of approximately 10% of the loan to be held for the 25 year payment period. The 
cost associated with the bond issuance has been estimated at 2.25% of the principal borrowed for the 
KWA project and 3% for the smaller loan associated with the Flint WTP improvements or the purchase 
of the 72-inch main. 

Furthermore, since no revenue will be generated to pay on the bonds for the first three years that the 
system is being constructed, the cost associated with capitalizing the interest was also included. 

Finally, interest on the reserve will be provided back to KWA and Flint. Although the interest is currently 
less than 1%, it was determined that a 3% rate would be more prudent long-term.

FINDINGS 


Using the information described in the previous sections, a cost evaluation was conducted for the KWA 
supply and the DWSD options. Individual worksheets for each option are provided in Appendix B. For 
the purpose of comparison a 30 year period was used. This period includes the 3 year construction 
period, the 25 loan period and an additional two years to get a sense of the cost of operation after the 
loans have been paid. 


There were three separate cost sheets prepared for the KWA option. The first cost sheet (KWA) is based 
on the cost estimate provided by KWA. The costs provided assumed no overruns or delay in 
construction. With KWA's own assumptions of an overrun in construction of 15% and a one year delay 
in operations, the KWA estimated cost becomes $686,375,920 through Year 2042. 


Since this cost estimate did not appear to include the financing of revenue bonds, another cost sheet 
(KWA-1) was developed that included KWA's cost estimate without overruns with the additional finance 
costs associated with the revenue bonds. A final cost sheet (KWA-2) includes the cost associated with 
the revenue bonds based on the estimate provided by TYJT for the Treasury. 


A summary of the cost sheets provided in Appendix B are shown in Table 6-1. Figure 6-1 shows the 
cumulative annual costs associated with each option.

Table 6-1: Total Cost of Options through 2042 


Based on the analysis, it is prudent to assume the KWA water supply option costs would be somewhere 
between the KWA-1 and KWA-2 options. Therefore, the analysis indicates that the two DWSD options 
of supplying 8 MGD on a maximum day and up to 8 MGD on average are the least cost options for Flint. 
These options allow Flint to maximize the use of existing assets; the City of Flint's (the Flint WTP) and 
DWSD's (the existing 72-inch main). 

Additionally, in recent conversations with the Treasury another option was discussed that could 
potentially be the most cost-effective solution. Currently the Flint WTP serves as a backup if service is 


17 



lost through either the DWSD or KWA pipeline. If the a twin pipe paralleling the DWSD 72-inch water 
main were constructed with interconnects with the 72-inch line, then the new water main could serve as 
the backup to Flint and the Flint WTP could be abandoned or potentially sold to Genesee County for 
their use. 


The construction of the parallel pipeline would be considered in the DWSD capital expenditure as a 
Common to All (CTA) cost. This means that the capital cost of the pipeline would be shared by all DWSD 
customers and not just by Flint. Preliminary analysis of this option appears to be the most cost-effective 
of all the options discussed. Flowever, a more thorough cost analysis is warranted and this approach 
would require an agreement between Flint and DWSD.

As part of the investigation other issues were identified that may result in risks to Flint that should be 
considered by the Treasury in determining how Flint's potable water should be supplied. These issues 
are related to redundancy and reliability, other items affecting cost, and Flint's desire to control its own 
destiny related to its water supply. These are described further below. 


Redunda 


ncy/R 



In one of the first meetings related to this task assessment, which was held on November 1, 2012, the 
Genesee County Drain Commissioner, Mr. Jeff Wright, stated that one of the main reasons for pursuing 
the KWA supply option related to the lack of reliability of the DWSD system. Fie pointed to the 
Northeast blackout of 2003; a widespread power outage that occurred throughout parts of the 
Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada, on Thursday, August 14, 2003. He 
stated that Flint and Genesee County were out of water for several days. 


It is worth noting that this was a power outage of historic proportions that affected millions of 
Americans. However, DWSD did begin supplying water again relatively quickly in comparison to other 
major cities impacted by the same power outage. 


Furthermore, the KWA supply system offers less redundancy to Flint than the current DWSD system. 
Under both options, Flint is supplied by a single pipeline; however, DWSD has backup power at all of its 
major facilities supplying Flint. The KWA system will not have a redundant power at its pumping 
facilities. This would be a major risk. 

Currently, backup to the DWSD system for Flint is Flint's WTP using the Flint River as the source of 
supply. KWA has stated that the Flint River source would also be used as backup to Flint if the KWA 
supply through its pipeline was lost. However, since the Flint WTP would be upgraded to treat Lake 
Huron water under the KWA option, using the Flint River as a backup source would require the Flint 
WTP to maintain two process treatment streams. 


In addition to Flint and Genesee County, the DWSD's 72-inch main supplies Imlay City, Mayfield and the 
Greater Lapeer County Utilities Authority (GLCUA). The volume of water contained within the 72-inch 
main is approximately 30 MG. Only supplying these three remaining communities would cause the 
water age to increase dramatically; somewhere in excess of three weeks old, before reaching the 
customers' master meters. Since the half-life of chlorine in the DWSD system is approximately 5 days, 
the chlorine would most probably be near zero requiring re-chlorination of the finished water upstream 
of the master meters. 


Re-chlorinating is a costly and risky process due to the instability of chlorine gas. It is unknown whether 
DWSD would pursue this improvement or possibly abandoned the 72-inch pipeline. 

If Flint is supplied by the KWA system, then DWSD supplying their other customers along the 72-inch 
water main may be reconsidered. Since the KWA system is a raw water supply, the communities would 


19 



either have to build a treatment facility to treat the water from KWA or find another water source for 
their communities.

The design of the KWA supply and the construction of the system have not been completed; therefore, 
final costs and time to complete are unknown. Cost overruns and delays in completion will both 
negatively impact Flint's final cost. As example, if the project is not completed within the three year 
period, payment on the bonds will be due, but the revenue source needed from the sale of water could 
not be provided. 


Furthermore, there is always a risk with large water system construction; especially those including an 
intake in the Great Lakes, pumping stations and rehabilitation of older water treatment plants. These 
risks include the potential of explosive gases in tunneling below Lake Huron, changing site conditions 
associated with the large number of miles of pipe installation and rehabilitating an older WTP, and the 
startup and debugging of the entire pumping system. 


Flint has indicated that they have a high water loss. Not addressing this issue prior to sizing the Flint 
supply pipeline from KWA could cause the water main to be oversized along with its incremental cost in 
construction. 


Also, the KWA supply option appears to run counter to the Treasury's Competitive Grant Assistance 
Program (Formerly EVIP Grant). This program has been put in place to allow for communities to 
consolidate their services and save money. Two existing customers of DWSD (Flint and Genesee County) 
along with the potential of others customers (GLCUA, Mayfield, Imlay City) separating to from another 
water system is in contradiction to the program. 

Finally, there is a concern over the ability of smaller systems (KWA) over larger systems (DWSD) to pay 
for future unfunded mandates and regulations. Obviously, identifying regulation requirements over 30 
years is hard to determine. However, it is widely accepted that a large system has greater ability to 
respond to unfunded mandates because the cost can be distributed over a large customer base. 


Flint's Autonomy 

Flint has indicated that a major point of consideration is that they have no control over the rate 
increases issued to Flint by DWSD. All other counties supplied by DWSD have representatives on the 
Board of Water Commissioners (BOWC). The BOWC is one of the governing bodies that approve the 
water rates. Since Flint and Genesee County do not have a representative on the BOWC, Flint believes 
they are held "hostage" to DWSD's rates and cost of service. 

This issue was stated in Flint's handout at the November 1, 2012 meeting. The handout is titled, "Flint 
Water Supply Future." However, it is worth noting in the same handout, Flint also identifies similar 
concerns with the governing board of the KWA system. Notably, that although Flint and Genesee 
County will be the only customers and Flint will be responsible for 30 percent of the construction cost, 


20 



they will have a minority vote on the KWA board. Furthermore, there are other communities (Lapeer 
County, the City of Lapeer, and Sanilac County) that sit on the board and vote. However, they are not 
purchasing water nor contributing to the construction costs.

PURPOSE OF Meeting with DWSD for the Indefinite-scope, Indefinite-delivery Contract 

MEETING: Number 00383, 2012 Professional General Architectural/Engineering Services - 

City of Flint Water Supply Assessment 

prepared BY: Dave Guastella 


A meeting was held at the DWSD Main Office Building on November 19, 2012 to discuss the water 
supply options being presented by DWSD to the City of Flint. The main items discussed generally 
followed the attached DWSD Discussion/Questions that were provided to the Department prior to 
the meeting. A summary of the key points discussed are provided below. 

DISCUSSION ITEMS 

1. Question/Discussion Item: Verify that the four options presented at the November 1, 2012 
meeting are still available for consideration: 

a. Supplied from Potter & Baxter using the new model contract (assume a Maximum Day 
Customer), 

b. Supplied from Imlay Station, 

c. Finished un-pumped supply from Lake Huron WTP, and 

d. Raw un-pumped supply from Lake Huron WTP. 

DWSD prefers to focus on the first two supply point listed; from the current location at Potter 
& Baxter and at the Imlay Pump Station as these apply specifically to Flint. 

DWSD provided the attached summary regarding the current costs to Flint based on the 
various options that DWSD is offering. The savings associated with each option is provided as 
well. As example, if Flint were to purchase water from the supply point located at Imlay 
Station, the current cost to Flint would be $5,661,000 and it would be a savings of nearly 50%

compared to Flint's current rate. 


2. Question/Discussion Item: What additional capital improvements will be required for each 
option? 

If Im lay Pump Station is selected as the supply point then Flint would need to purchase the 72- 
inch water main and an agreement to supply Lapeer would need to be worked out. DWSD 
believes that this could be worked out through a "wheeling" charge over the 72-inch main or 
possibly moving the supply point downstream of the Lapeer connection.. DWSD estimates the 
value of the water main at $4. 7M. Flint could bond for this amount or DWSD could include the 
cost into Flint's rate. 

3. Question/Discussion Item: Are there other options being presented that should be 
considered (e.g., blending)? 

Only the two options indicated above are currently being considered and both would include 
blending; DWSD providing 2/3 of the supply and the Flint WFP providing the other 1/3. 

4. Question/Discussion Item: To evaluate each option over the 25 year planning period, provide: 

a. Annual water rate for Flint for 2002 through 2012, and the 

b. Projected annual rate adjustment for each option. What are the proposed measures 
to keep the rate adjustments down in the future? 

DWSD provided the attached historical rates from 2002 through 2012 for the existing water 
contract with Flint. The attachment also includes what the rates would have been if Flint had 
signed the new model contract or had taken service from Imlay. These rates were provided 
back to 2010. 

DWSD believes that 5% would be a good estimation to assume for their annual escalation in 
rates over the 25 year planning period. 

5. Question/Discussion Item: Flint stated a 10% increase in the capacity charge. What number 
did DWSD provide Flint? 

It was unclear to DWSD where the 10% increase in capacity charge stated by Flint came from. 
DWSD's information provided shows an average of 6.3%. DWSD offered a meeting with TYJT 
to discuss how the fixed and commodity charges are allocated. 

6. Question/Discussion Item: Flint financial comparison is based on the initial Cost of 
$14,413,858, which includes $2,725,538 for Flint WTP operating cost; i.e, DWSD charge is 
$11,688,320. Flow good is this number? 

DWSD indicated that the charge of $11,638,320 is good through 6/30/13. based on their 
existing contract with DWSD. 

7. Question/Discussion Item: KWA's initial charge to Flint is based on 12 MGD. Is DWSD charge

based on 12 MGD? 


Yes, 12 MGD from DWSD would be a maximum with Flint supplying 6 MGD for a total of 18 
MGD (2/3 vs. 1/3).

PURPOSE OF Meeting with the City of Flint for the Indefinite-scope, Indefinite-delivery 

MEETING: Contract Number 00383, 2012 Professional General Architectural/Engineering 

Services - City of Flint Water Supply Assessment 

PREPARED BY: Dave Guastella 


A meeting was held at the City of Flint Municipal Center on November 20, 2012 to discuss the water 
supply option being presented by the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to the City of Flint. The 
main items discussed generally followed the attached KWA Discussion/Questions that were 
provided to City prior to the meeting. A summary of the key points discussed are provided below. 

The questions submitted are repeated in the Discussion Items for easy reference. A summary of the 
action items generated from the meeting follow the Discussion Items. 

DISCUSSION ITEMS 

1. Question/Discussion Item: Is the maximum day demand of 18 MGD for Flint the maximum day 
demand (MDD) throughout the 25 year planning period? If not, what is the 25 year projected 
MDD? 

KWA would supply up to 18 MGD. 18 MGD has been assumed as the maximum day demand and 
12 MGD is assumed as the average day demand throughout the 25 year planning period. 

2. Question/Discussion Item: Copy of the intake contract documents and engineer's estimate. 

The intake contract documents are approximately 90% complete and are not available for 
distribution. Flowever, the updated Appendix 20, dated October 4, 2012 includes the most recent 
cost estimate of the intake based on the current design in process. 


Comments: Meeting minutes were recorded based on the understanding of the author. Please contact the 
author within three days if you have any different understanding of the meeting. These minutes will be 
considered approved unless comments are provided within three days. 




3. Question/Discussion Item: Documentation of the Flint WTP improvements required and cost 
estimate. 

The costs are approximately $7M as presented in the September 2009 Preliminary Engineering 
Report. However, this estimate has been updated. Some processes have been eliminated. John 
O'Brien will provide the updated costs and the description of the planned improvements to the 
plant. 

4. Question/Discussion Item: Confirm Flint's allocated percentage of the KWA capital improvements 
(30%?). 

Yes, the allocation is based on 18 MGD/60 MGD total capacity. 

5. Question/Discussion Item: Copy of the proposed KWA operating agreement for Flint. 

John O'Brien will provide the operating agreement as well as the Capacity Contract and Articles of 
Incorporation. 

6. Question/Discussion Item: What is the annual operating agreement adjustment projected for the 
25 year planning period? 

This information is provided in Appendix 14, Table 14.2 of the September 2009 Preliminary 
Engineering Report. Operating cost based on Table 1. Used 12 MGD as average day demand 
(ADD). Assumed 5% as the annual increase in operating costs. John O'Brien indicated that these 
operating costs were based on Genesee County's operating costs. John O'Brien will provide the 
last 10 years of audited financial statements for the water fund. 

To assess operating and maintenance costs for the Flint WTP, Duffy will provide multiple years of 
financial statements for the water fund. Duffy did not believe they had 10 years, but they will 
provide what they have. 

Regarding operation and maintenance costs, Flint believes that these costs will increase by 2/3 of 
what they are now. 

7. Question/Discussion Item: Need the route of the pipelines and the locations of the facilities 
proposed. Purpose is to identify constraints that impact costs (i.e., utilities, environmental (e.g. 
wetlands), easements, etc.). 

KWA will not release the route due to concerns regarding speculation of land and easements. John 
O'Brien did indicate that the Lake Huron pump station would be at Fisher and M-25. The 
intermediate pump station site is near a location of the Lapeer/Sanilac/St. Clair border; where all 
three meet. 

8. Question/Discussion Item: KWA's initial charge to Flint is based on a 12 MGD average day 
demand. What is the basis of this number? Are there population projections and water use 
figures available that were used to determine the Flint demand for the 25 year planning period?

This was answered in Question No. 1 above. 


9. Question/Discussion Item: Is there a transition plan and cost during construction of the KWA 
system identified? 

Flint is looking for an agreement with DWSDfor back-up supply from the 72-inch main at the 
Genesee border. 

10. Question/Discussion Item: The October 4, 2012 Preliminary Engineering Report Update states: 
"no backup power is planned for the pumps" (LHPS) and "No backup power is planned for 
pumping" (IPS). In case of power loss, how would Flint supply its customers? 

Flint indicated that they have adequate storage to supply the system for 6 to 7 days. Flint has 55 
MG of storage and Genesee County has 65 MG for 2.5 days. 


11. Question/Discussion Item: The latest plan shows only a 5 million gallon ground reservoir is 
planned for balancing between LHPS and IPS. How is redundancy maintained? 

In cases of emergency, Flint indicated that the back-up for the KWA system will be the same as it is 
now with DWSD; they will use the Flint River as the source water. Flint currently operates their 
plant four times a year. 

When questioned as to whether the WTP will be able to treat both lake water from the KWA 
system and river water Flint indicated that once the improvements identified in the September 
2009 Preliminary Engineering Report are completed they will be able to accomplish both 
treatment processes. Flint will provide a schematic of the treatment trains at the WTP and a copy 
of the Flint transmission system. 

Genesee County indicated that additional redundancy would also be provided from the new 
Genesee County WTP. 

Regarding hydraulic transients; Genesee County indicated that a model analysis has not been 
included, but capital costs for mitigating transients have been included. 

12. Question/Discussion Item: Related to the construction cost: 

a. Does it include an additional traffic lane since the construction will occupy half the right of 
way? Not required, all roads are county roads; however, there are a few State road 
crossings. 

b. Does it include costs/fees for permit requirements such as inspection cost by the 
jurisdictional authorities? As a point of reference, the permit fee costs for the Flint 
Transmission System came out to be $5.8 million. Not required; all of the counties have 
waived any fees. 

c. Does the cost of the steel pipe segments include corrosion protection measures such as

considered approved unless comments are provided within three days. 



anode stations and related O&M? Yes; however ; the KWA has not settled on using steel 
pipe. PCCP pipe may be used. Steel shown in estimate because it is highest in cost and 
therefore the pricing is conservative. 

d. SCADA monitoring stations require power. Is the cost of bring power to the SCADA 
stations included? Again, as a point of reference for the Flint Transmission System we 
estimated $800,000 for power to SCADA and valve operators. Yes, Genesee County did 
emphasize that the SCADA system will be simple and straightforward because a lot of 
controls are not required. 

e. Other items discussed at the meeting included: 

• The 2009 plant improvement cost is still good; however, there will be some 
reduction, such as a sulfuric chloride feed system that was eliminated. Plant 
capacity now is 36MGD, but will be 18 MGD. 

• The KWA Lake Huron Pumping Station (LHPS) is now only high lift pump station. 

• Genesee County will provide the distance of the intake pipe from the crib to the 
LHPS. 

• The intake project is almost ready to bid; waiting for the COE permit. 

• Genesee County is estimating the construction for the pipe lines and pump 
stations will begin July 2013. 

• The route has been flown for survey. 

• Genesee County is estimating construction will be complete and the project will 
be placed in service by Jan 2016. 

• Genesee County to provide a list of assumptions that the $272 million cost 
estimate is based on since the route is now known. 

13. The Flint River is identified as a backup: At what capacity? MDD or emergency supply? 

The Flint River would serve as a back up supply. 

14. Where did the 40 years come from (Flint hostage to Detroit)? DWSD's new contracts are 30 years 
with openers to revise terms of supply (volume and pressure) after the first two years, then three 
years, and then in five year increments thereafter. 

The 40 years was stated in error. The reference was to DWSD's requirement to sign a 30 year 
contract. 

After 40 years Flint will own 30% of the project and can sell their share of ownership if they want. 
Conversely, with DWSD, they continue to pay for the capital projects but have no ownership. Flint 
believes they will know what they will be charged for the next 25 years versus DWSD that can't 
commit to a fixed escalation.

KWA Discussion/Questions for the November 20, 2012 Meetirn 


1. Is the maximum day demand of 18 MGD for Flint the maximum day demand (MDD) 
throughout the 25 year planning period? If not, what is the 25 year projected MDD? 

2. Copy of the intake contract documents and engineer's estimate. 

3. Documentation of the Flint WTP improvements required and cost estimate. 

4. Confirm Flint's allocated percentage of the KWA capital improvements (30%?). 

5. Copy of the proposed KWA operating agreement for Flint. 

6. What is the annual operating agreement adjustment projected for the 25 year planning 
period? 

7. Need the route of the pipelines and the locations of the facilities proposed. Purpose is to 
identify constraints that impact costs (i.e., utilities, environmental (e.g. wetlands), 
easements, etc.). 

8. KWA's initial charge to Flint is based on a 12 MGD maximum day demand. What is 
the basis of this number? Are there population projections and water use figures 
available that were used to determine the Flint demand for the 25 year planning 
period? 

9. Is there a transition plan and cost during construction of the KWA system identified? 

10. The October 4, 2012 Preliminary Engineering Report Update states: "no backup 
power is planned for the pumps" (LHPS) and "No backup power is planned for 
pumping" (IPS). In case of power loss, how would Flint supply its customers? 

11. The latest plan shows only a 5 million gallon ground reservoir is planned for 
balancing between LHPS and IPS. How is redundancy maintained?

Subject: Information about Flint blood lead level testing results release 
Good evening Governor and team, 

We're working with the Department of Health and Human Services on its release of blood 
lead level testing results, with some continuing discussions about messaging and timing. 

I've attached the draft press release, an informational graphic and talking points. 

This is a challenging situation to be sure, but I think these results are fairly encouraging 
considering some of the heated rhetoric on this issue. We are discussing a "people first" 
approach to messaging, and perhaps issuing early next week rather than on at 9:B0 a.m. 
on a Friday so it doesn't look like we are burying news. 

In a nutshell: 

■ Blood lead level testing results released today revealed that 24 of 963 adults and 

children tested in Flint in October had elevated levels, according to the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

■ MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to reach out to 

families testing with higher levels and help them reduce their exposure to lead 
sources. 

■ Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 963 children and adults 

between October 1 and October 30. Eighteen people age 17 or younger had elevated 
blood lead levels. Six adults over the age 18 were identified with elevated blood lead 
levels. 

■ The testing and follow-up work is part of our action plan.

Brad, we're good with the language below. 


Household Plumbing Tips from LARA 

• Check and clean aerator screens in faucets around the house. Screens can sometimes contain a buildup of lead 
contaminants. 

• Inspect household plumbing for lead solder. Solder joints connect pipes in household water distribution systems. 
If your house was built before 1987, your plumbing may have lead solder. 

• Look at the home water service pipes that connect the water main in the street to the household plumbing. 
Homes built in the mid-1950s may still have lead service pipes. 

• Call a professional. Have your home inspected by a licensed plumbing contractor to determine the features of 
your household plumbing. To verify if a plumbing contractor is licensed, visit: ww, 1 a ra , state .mi. us/bed i cense/

Good afternoon Governor, 


Sorry for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHH5 is hoping to issue the release this afternoon to 
avoid issuing news on Friday. The DHHS team has answered the questions and made significant revisions 
to the press release at my request. 1 think this is far more reader friendly and people focused. 

Here are the specific answers to the questions: 

Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to lead sources is 
reduced. The purpose of screening children for lead is to identify those with elevated levels. Removing 
potential sources of lead exposure and ensuring proper nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in 
blood lead levels in follow-up testing, which is an important part of case management. Lead has a half- 
life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 days; and in the non-labile portion of 
bone, more than 25 years. 

Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter of 
each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors including 
increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer months. 

DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr, Wells available to answer questions. 


Thank you for your consideration. 
Dave

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to 
lead sources is reduced. The purpose of screening children for lead is to identify 
those with elevated levels. Removing potential sources of lead exposure and 
ensuring proper nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in blood lead levels in 
follow-up testing, which is an important part of case management. Lead has a 
half-life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 days; and in 
the non-labile portion of bone, more than 25 years. 


Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during 
the third quarter of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the 
result of a number of factors including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil 
in the summer months. 


DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr. Wells available to answer

December 2014 



The Michigan Emergency Management Act (Public Act 390 of 1976, as amended) outlines the 
emergency management process for the state of Michigan. If an incident exhausts state resources, the 
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 USC §§ 5121-5207) establishes 
the process for requesting and obtaining a presidential disaster declaration and assistance from the 
federal government. 

STEP BY STEP: Emergency or Disaster Declaration Process 

1 . Disasters are first and foremost local events. Most disasters are handled by local government with 
minimal or no state assistance. At the onset of a disaster or emergency, local emergency 
responders, joined by volunteers and the private sector, are the first to be involved. 

2. A local jurisdiction may declare a “Local State of Emergency” exists when they have sustained 
widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life or property. A local declaration ensures the 
response and recovery aspects of the emergency operations plan have been activated, and local 
resources are being utilized to the fullest extent possible. Authorities may authorize local aid and 
assistance. 

3. If recovery efforts are beyond the ability of local government, the community may turn to the state to 
request assistance. All requests for assistance are channeled through the Michigan State Police, 
Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division. 

4. The Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division reviews 
specific requests for state assistance and makes recommendations to the Governor’s Office. The 
Governor’s authority, granted by the Michigan Emergency Management Act, may include mobilizing 
state government agencies to provide necessary support and assistance to local authorities under a 
“State of Emergency” or “State of Disaster” declaration. 

5. If state and local government resources are unable to cope with the emergency or disaster, the 
Governor may request assistance through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Region V Office in Chicago. 

6. At the request of the Governor, FEMA may conduct a Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) in 
cooperation with state and local emergency management officials. The results of the PDA will be 
reviewed by state officials and the Governor’s Office and used as a basis for determining whether to 
request federal financial assistance. 

7. Should the state request federal disaster assistance, FEMA will review the request and make a 
recommendation to the president, who will make the final determination on any disaster aid to be 
provided to the state. The goal of disaster assistance is not to make individuals, businesses or 
government entities whole again, but to restore the community to a level that meets expected health 
and safety considerations.

In case you missed it: 

Michigan continues to have the weakest anti-corruption laws of any state in the nation. 

As the Rachel Maddow Show reported on last night, the Flint water crisis is a terrible reminder that our state continues to exempt the 
Governor's office and state legislators from transparency laws (FOIA) designed to hold politicians and our government accountable. This 
exemption from FOIA only making things worse... much worse. 

"Common Cause Michigan calls on the Governor to drop his executive privilege and submit all documents and correspondence in the 
executive office on all matters dealing with the Flint water crisis to Freedom of Information Act requests. The public deserves to know why 
Flint's children were poisoned with lead. In addition, Michigan should end special exemption from FOIA and subject the Governor's Office 
and the Legislature to the same transparency laws that 48 other states follow," said Melanie McElroy, Executive Director of Common Cause 
Michigan.

Flint water contamination investigated by US EPA, prosecutors 


Hi, 

I am a reporter from Reuters. Has the governor's office talked with the U.S. Attorney in Detroit or the U.S. EPA about the 
Flint water crisis? 

Have you been notified formally of a federal criminal or civil probe about the drinking water supply in Flint? 

Does the governor have a comment on the acknowledgement by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit that they are 
looking into the contamination? 

Any help much appreciated.

Subject: Flint water contamination investigated by US EPA, prosecutors 

Hi, 

I am a reporter from Reuters. Has the governor's office talked with the U.S. Attorney in Detroit or the U.S. EPA about the 
Flint water crisis? 

Have you been notified formally of a federal criminal or civil probe about the drinking water supply in Flint? 

Does the governor have a comment on the acknowledgement by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit that they are 
looking into the contamination? 

Any help much appreciated. 

Sincerely, 

David Bailey

Eli Richard, 

The Governor is proud of the efforts his office has made to increase transparency and accountability, including 
dashboards featuring metrics for each department and creation of a citizen's guide to how state and local 
governments spend money. We're always focusing on continuous quality improvement in this area. 

The Governor also has promised complete cooperation with the independent Flint Water Task Force that is reviewing 
all state, local and federal actions related to the situation as the administration focuses on the health and welfare of 
people in Flint and across the state.

When we talked yesterday, you mentioned that you had three days to gather information. What happened to speed up 
that process? 


Also, the Governor's statement references state assistance. Has he made a decision about seeking federal help as well?

We see the news today that the U.S. Attorney has confirmed its involvement with the EPA investigation into what

Can you tell me, please, whether your office has had any contact with the U.S. Attorney either before that story 
appeared this morning or since then? Will your office reach out to the U.S. Attorney? 

In the event that Governor Snyder or members of the administration are asked to testify or provide documents, will the 
Governor and the administration comply?

Subject: Flint News Article and Update 

Note the below article on the Flint water issue. They are starting to follow the emergency management 
process to include implementing their Support Emergency Operations Plan (Flint's is attached). The 
County has an Emergency Operations Plan that Flint is to support. Opening an EOC is key for 
coordination and that has been done at the city level (at least to some degree but probably not at the 
staffing level it needs to be at this time). 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to 
consult with the county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and 
Michigan State Police once he has been given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that 
the situation is beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the county board chair, may then 


l 



declare a state of emergency and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's 
declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

We are working to make sure we have all the information needed to ensure the Mayor and County 
Commissioner understand the limitations of the Emergency Management Act and Stafford Act. They 
may find that the energy they are spending hoping for a federal emergency declaration may be better 
spent looking to HUD or EPA for assistance. A better job is needed to manage expectations which I will 
work with others on that. We will also make sure they understand what information we would need 
before we look at a Governor or Presidential declaration. They cannot just ask for a Governor's 
declaration ... they need to provide us information as to why they need it and what they (Flint and the 
County) have done thus far. 

As outlined in the Michigan Emergency Management Plan, Local EM programs must ensure that local 
disaster relief forces are utilized to the maximum extent possible, including the use of local contractors, 
activation of mutual aid and other standing agreements, and use of nearby resources. State disaster 
assistance is used to supplement local efforts and resources, and to help relieve extraordinary burden. It 
is NOT to be used for simple budgetary relief or to relieve hardship. FEMA's first questions will be, "What 
is it (specifically) they need that they cannot get from others." 


Genesee County chairman says he can send Flint disaster request to governor 

Ron Fonger

(This story has been updated with comment from Flint ayor Karen Weaver.) 

FLINT, Ml -- Genesee County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jamie Curtis says he is authorized to 
forward Flint's request for a disaster declaration to the governor and plans to meet with Mayor Karen 
Weaver about it next week. 

In a letter to Weaver Thursday, Dec. 17, Curtis says county guidelines and state law call for him to 
consult with the county's emergency management coordinator -- Sheriff Robert Pickell -- and Michigan 
State Police once he has been given the declaration. 

"Upon such consultation and review of the city's declaration of emergency and upon determining that 
the situation is beyond the capabilities of the county to handle, I as the the county board chair, may 
then declare a state of emergency and request assistance from the state of Michigan and a governor's 
declaration," Curtis' letter says. 

Curtis declined to comment further on the matter, but he chairman's letter says he will "do whatever I 
can ... to assist the city of Flint as it continues to struggle with its emergency water situation." 

Weaver said she plans to meet with Curtis and other emergency management officials Monday, Dec. 21, 
to work on the request. 

Earlier this week, Curtis said he did not plan to call a special meeting of the county Board of 
Commissioners to consider the disaster request but would add the issue to the agenda of the county 
board at its next meeting on Jan. 4. 

The mayor has said state and federal funds are needed to respond to health problems caused by lead in 
drinking water here and to replace thousands of lead service lines in the city. 


2 




Weaver's declaration, read to the City Council Monday, Dec. 14, did not include an estimate of damages 
suffered by the city and residents. 


To support the request for disaster relief, the city also announced that it has enacted its "Support 
Emergency Operations Plan" and opened an "Emergency Operations Center." 

Sean Kammer, assistant to the city administrator, said the center is available to answer questions from 
residents and will be used to coordinate relief efforts. 

The EOC is located in Flint Fire Station 1, 310 E. Fifth St., and the center can be reached by calling 810- 
237-6888, extension 5005 from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN 


I. Purpose 

The City of Flint has elected to be incorporated into the Genesee County Emergency Management 
Program. By becoming part of the county emergency management program, the City of Flint and 
Genesee County have certain responsibilities to each other, This Support Emergency Operations Plan 
has been developed to identify the responsibilities between the City of Flint and Genesee County in 
regards to pre-disaster emergency management activities. It also provides for City of Flint government 
agencies to respond to various types of emergencies or disasters that affect the community. This 
support plan is to be used in concurrence with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guideline, as it 
is a supporting document. The support plan will be maintained in accordance with the most current 
standards of the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. Review of this support plan shall be 
accomplished concurrently with the county plan. 

II. Scope 

This plan is a flexible document in which changes from the content of the plan may occur due to 
unique nature of emergencies. Each agency that has a supported role in this plan or its elements has 
developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which provides systematic instructions for 
accomplishing assigned functions. In addition, to support emergency preparedness and response 
efforts, the local government also conducts other activities such as personnel training, participating in 
exercises, encouraging chronic disease prevention techniques; educate the public on awareness 
activities, and use of appropriate land use planning decisions for mitigation and prevention purposes as 
well. Through this plan, the City of Flint continues to implement the National Incident Management 
System, participating in efforts to provide an effective and efficient incident management operation. 

III. Plan Maintenance and Implementation 

The plan has been developed together with local community, and county officials to ensure 
consistency within the county emergency management program documents. The plan is required to be 
approved by the City of Flint’s Chief Executive Official every four years, or whenever the CEO 
changes and is to be forwarded to the County Emergency Management Office. Upon approval, it will 
be implemented, tested through exercises in concurrence with County officials, and review/updated to 
maintain currentness with the Genesee County Emergency Action Guidelines. 

This plan has been provided to all municipal agencies, elected officials, the county emergency 
management office and the MSP/EMHSD district coordinator. 

IV. Emergency Management Program Oversight 

The City of Flint has appointed the Chief of Fire to serve as the city’s emergency management liaision 
responsible for working with the County Emergency Management Coordinator in matters pertaining to 
emergency management for the municipality. Pursuant the requirements in P.A. 390, of 1976, as 
amended, Section 19, Genesee County has adopted a resolution that incorporates the City of Flint into 
its emergency management program, necessary for diaster assistance.

CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN 


BASIC INFORMATION 


I. Community Profile 

The City of Flint is situated in the center of Genesee County. At 33.42 square miles, it is the county’s 
largest city. According to the United States Census Bureau, Flint’s estimated population is 99,763. 

Flint has an average number of people identified as individuals with special/functional needs for a 
city of its size. Many of these individuals reside in congregate care centers, but others reside in non- 
group homes where help is provided as needed or on-call. 

According to the Genesee County Hazard Mitigation Plan, the three situations the community is most 
vulnerable to is: inclement weather (e.g. thunderstorms, hail, lightning and severe wind storms, snow, 
tornadoes), structure fires and hazardous material incidents. All of these incidents can happen 
anywhere within the community, but hazardous material incidents are more likely to occur on the 
major expressways and highways. 1-475, 1-69, M-21 & M-54 all pass through Flint while 1-75/US 23 is 
very close to its western border. More information regarding hazard vulnerability can be found in the 
County’s Hazard Mitigation Plan/ Analysis. 

Within the community, there are 19 sites that contain extremely hazardous materials. Pursuant to 
SARA Title III, off-site emergency response plans have been developed by the LEPC to prepare the 
fire department(s) to respond to the specific hazardous materials on the sites. In addition, the owners 
of the site(s) have reported the types of hazardous material that is housed on-site, as required by the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act. 

II. Emergency Management Authority 

Pursuant to P.A. 390 of 1976, as amended, the municipal CEO may declare a local state of emergency 
for the City of Flint. Also, Sections 1-801 and 3-306 of the Flint City Charter describe procedures 
regarding emergency luies and ordinances. Upon a declaration, PA 390 also authorizes the CEO to 
issue directives, such as restrictions to travel on local roads. The local declaration activates this 
emergency plan as well as the emergency operations center to conduct activities to ensure the safety of 
people, property, and the environment. 

Since the City of Flint has been a recipient of federal preparedness assistance, a resolution has been 
adopted by the local government for establishing the National Incident Management System as the 
standard for incident management for all-hazards. Through the adoption, the City continues to 
implement the concepts of the NIMS through training, planning, and exercising activities. 

III. Response Resources 

The City of Flint maintains fulltime departments of both Police and Fire. They are responsible for 
providing public safety and welfare to the community. Each department is comprised of qualified 
emergency personnel, and maintains equipment capable of responding to emergencies. A list of 
resources that the departments use for emergency situations can be requested through the municipal 
emergency management liaison. Under certain circumstances, if the incident requires additional 
resources beyond the capability of the City of Flint, the CEO may enact mutual aid. This is a familiar 
practice within both departments. 


2 



IV. Emegency Management Organization 


The City of Flint emergency management organization consists of a number of departments 
responsible for conducting activities in response to emergencies within the community. These 
departments have been assigned to specific emergency functions for which the municipality has 
identified necessary in order to provide an effective response to secure the safety of people, property, 
and the environment. Each agency is responsible for implementing pre-disaster activities to help 
prevent and/or prepare for various hazards that the community is vulnerable to such as: chronic 
diseases, flooding, hazardous material spills, inclement weather, tornadoes, and public disturbance to 
name a few; a more profound list can be found in the County's Hazard Mitigation Plan/Analysis. 
Prevention and preparedness activities include: awareness training, exercising, hygienic practices to 
prevent spreading of infectious diseases, stockpiling equipment, and educating people on how to care 
for themselves during an emergency. 

The CEO serves as the incident manager for municipal coordination. At his/her side includes the 
Finance Director and the Emergency Management Liaison (EML). The EML’s duties include 
planning, operations, and logistics. 

The table lists the functions, assigned agencies, primary point of contact of municipal EOC

Michigan Health Department Hid 
Evidence of Health Harm Due to 
Lead Contaminated Water: Allowed 
False Public Assurances by MDEQ 
and Stonewalled Outside 
Researchers 


After missing warning signs of spiking childhood lead 
poisoning that occurred a few months after switching to a 
corrosive river water source in 2014, outside pressure 


1 




forced officials at the Michigan Department of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS) to closely scrutinize their data in 
July 2015. They discovered scientifically conclusive 
evidence of an anomalous increase in childhood lead 
poisoning summer 2014 immediately after the switch in 
water sources, but stood by silently as MDEQ officials 
repeatedly and falsely stated that no spike in blood lead 
levels (BLL) of children had occurred. DHHS employees 
later stonewalled efforts by outside researchers who 
questioned MDEQs statements, withheld damning 
documents but released incomplete data suggesting that 
there were no problems— DHHS officials ultimately fessed 
up only after incidence of childhood lead poisoning 
skyrocketed above 10% in the two Flint zip codes 
with highest water lead risk during summer 2015! 


DHHS Pressured to Examine Data in mid-July 2015 


DHHS’ engagement in the Flint water crisis, started in early 
2015 with two phone calls from Lee-Anne Walters to a state 
lead poisoning nurse in Lansing identified only as “Karen.” 
When asked about the phone call last night, Walters said 
she was at first expressing concern over high water lead 
measurements in Flint, but on the second call she was in 
tears because her son’s blood lead had increased to 6.5 
ug/dL. 

According to Walters, “Karen” stated that “He is barely 
lead poisoned. If CDC had not changed their lead 
poisoning standard from. 10 down to 5, we would 
not be having this conversation .” Angry, Walters 
protested that Karen was minimizing the problem, at which 
point “Karen” cut her off and said “I am working with 
kids in their 40’s and go’s. It is just a few IQ 
points... it is not the end of the world. ” FOIA e-mails 
demonstrate that Karen Lishinski (DHHS) acknowledged 
receiving phone calls on the dates Walters called (the 
caller’s name is redacted in the FOIA), but elsewhere 
Lishinski acknowledges to colleagues that the last time she 
actually worked with a child who had blood lead above 45 
ug/dL was in 2009. 



The next time the Flint water issue was apparently raised at 
DHHS, was July 23 rd , when Linda Dkykema (DCH) sent out 
an e-mail titled “R.E. Director’s Office Assignment- 
Flint- need update ASAP” on the heels of the memo 
written fay EPA’s Miguel Del Torah 


misinformed from the Outset: MDEQ Garbage-in Ail but 
Ensures DHHS Garbaqe-out 


The Director’s Office update was tainted and probably 
doomed from the start, because Dykema logically reached 
out to MDEQ’s Steve Busch for background who provided 
her the following insights: 

“ The city of Flint recently conducted drinking 
water testing throughout the city with special 
attention to those areas known to have old service 
lines . The city water supply is in compliance with 
the lead rule....DEQ has not seen a change in the 
city’s compliance with the lead rule since 
switching to the Flint River source... .Regarding 
the home with high drinking water lead levels : 
some years ago the supply line that serves the 
neighborhood was replaced , but somehow this 
house was not connected to the new line, such that 
the family’s drinking water supply was coming 
from the old coi*roded lead pipe. None of the 
neighbors water had elevated lead level... 
Regarding the EFA drinking water official quoted 
in the press articles: the report that he issued was 
a result of his own research and was not reviewed 
or approved bu EFA management. He has 
essentially acted outside his authority. ” 

In other words, Dykema and DHHS started out their 
investigation with demonstrably false MDEQ talki ng p oints 

as assumptions. Nonetheless, a team of researchers 
proceeded to examine their data for possible increased 
incidence of lead poisoning in Flint’s children after the 
water switch. 




The DHHS team immediately found evidence of a problem. 
Specifically, in the summer months of July, August and 
September of 2014 immediately after the switch, blood lead 
levels in Flint had been much higher than normal. On July 
27th of 2015, an e-mail asked “can you quickly run any tests 
to see if the difference in the first graph is statistically 
significant,” and the result quickly came back that it was. 
The team tried to re-run the data adding extra years to see 
if it changed the conclusions, but it did not because “there 
does appear to be a higher proportion of EBLL dead 
poisoning > last summer than usual.” 

A July 28 th e-mail summarized the exercise by noting “ This 
doesn’t say anything about causality, but it does 
warrant further investigation ” and a two page memo 
was created for the Director’s Office (see excerpt Figure 1). 
The “ quick detection of abnormal variation ” in July, 
warranting further investigation, does not seem to have 
gone any further, and the study results did not seen the 
light of day until this FOIA request. 

However, MDEQ’s Brad Wurfel did publicly begin stating 
that study had been done, and using the results for public 
relations purposes as early as September 6 th , 2015. 
Ironically, it was used todiscredit on. hi^h.le^d. in 
wafer collected by Virginia Tech: 



In other words, Wurfel was completely misrepresenting the 
conclusions of the DHHS July 2015 blood lead study— to 
claim there was no spike in children’s blood lead when 
there was one. The FOIA does not reveal precisely where, or 
how, Wurfel was so misinformed. But the record is also 
perfectly clear that DHHS sat silently by as Wurfel repeated 
the false statements throughout the month of September.

Outside Researchers Asking to Analyze Flint’s Blood 
Lead Data Were Stonewalled: “YikesF 9 


On September 2 nd 2015, Professor Marc Edwards of Virginia 
Tech (primary author of this article and source of the 
Freedom of Information Act documents cited herein) made 
a simple data request of DHHS. Edwards had previously 
made an identical request in November 2006 for a blood 
lead study in Lansing, and that data was provided without 
any problems. Edwards did not expect problems this time. 

His request sat without response until a reminder e-mail 
was sent, at which point DHHS employee Robert Scott 
apologized for the delay, and provided the information 
needed to process the request, acknowledging: 

Yes, I think this <study> sounds great . There has 
been some concern about the water source change 
in Flint , and in fact we had a call about it today . 

The request then sat another 3 days, at which point 
Edwards inquired again and DHHS said that they were 
busy and if Edwards wanted the data in “a week rather 
than a month or so-then please send me a 
paragraph explaining why. ” Edwards wrote: 

Yes, 1 think there is clearly some urgency to the 
situation , MDJBQ has publicly stated that your 
blood lead records, are showing that there is no 
public health concern for residents in Flint. The 
levels of lead in Flint water, that we are finding in 
our water sampling, are certainly in a range that 
can cause childhood lead poisoning. Indeed, one 
child has already, likehs been lead poisoned from 
exposure to high lead in water. I think the fact 
that you already have other teams working on 
these records, indicates a high level of interest, 
and urgency . Congressional interest in the safety 
of the water is also very high, and this will be an 


7 



important issue in deciding options for treating 
the water , in the weeks and months ahead . 

If red flags about the data request had not already gone up, 
the e-mails clearly show alarms were raised immediately 
throughout all of DHHS after Scott wrote to colleges at 1:09 
pm on September 11, 2015 that: 

“The attached was submitted to me along with a 
request for de-identified data , which should be no 
problem . When you have a few minutes you might 
want to take a look at it. Sounds like there might 
be more to this than what we learned previously. 
Vik(>s * ” 

A flurry of e-mails followed, and within the hour, Edwards 
request that Scott had just said “should be no problem ” 
was in fact encountering all kinds of problems. Specifically, 
a privacy specialist immediately asked for (amongst other 
things): 

“I want to know more about the study. .Saying 
that the researcher wants to verify the claim of 
MDEQ is not sufficient.... It does not have to be a 
great deal longer , but it should explain what the 
intended use of the blood lead data is. It is also 
important to know exactly how it will be used for 
research in order to justify the release....” 

The next few weeks were an exercise in frustration, during 
which it became perfectly apparent to Edwards that DHHS 
had no interest in fulfilling the routine data request. 

In the meantime, emails during the same time period 
indicate that the state had plenty of time scrutinizing the 
Virginia Tech data (e.g., “The issue has been ongoing on for 
awhile now, but picked up steam in July when the Virginia 
Tech folks got involved.”). Moreover, Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha of Hurley Medical Center had made her own data 
request in mid-September, and she was having trouble 
getting it processed as well. Edwards wrote to DHHS on 
September 24th: 


8 


I just spoke to this young researcher at Hurley , 
and apparently , she has been unable to get access 
to the state blood lead records . I have to say , it is 

tL^-' ft-* 1 of £ c / £ rCQdp fC B ® ai v_y <5Ljr ft, ft^ft. ar H l >x> ft,.* jfi jp njj> ft'ft. ft, * £.Bu£ ft. £ *B ’RT^.'ojjf !&_ .✓ 

blood lead reports and statements in their press 
releases , and refuses to share the data backing 
them up with outside researchers . Even worse , 
state reps are running around claiming that these 
reports are proof that Flint water is safe to drink. 
Can you tell me why it is so difficult to get this 
data , and why your agency is raising so many 
obstacles to sharing it with everyone who asks? I 
note that I have been asking to see your data since 
MDEQ first sent it to reporters back in August , 
and I count 10 e-mails that I sent responding to all 
your questions . As of yet, you have given me 
nothing in response. Yet you have been sending 
reporters one report after another. It seems your 
agency is more interested in public relations than 
sound science . 

DHHS Scott immediately wrote to colleagues claiming “ Fm 
not very happy with him <Edwards> right now f 
and drafted a response that apologized for delays, his 
vacation, and acknowledging “my time has been 
largely taken up with my Department’s response 
to the current situation in Flint” Hence, the FOIA 
reveals that DHHS had created their own catch- 
22: because they had stood and said nothing while MDEQ 
made false claims about what the blood lead data showed, 
they had no time to provide data to researchers that wanted 
to test the truthfulness of the claim. 

Scott’s DHHS colleague Nancy Peeler asserted that 
Edwards e-mail had “intent to escalate and spin 
things ,” and that he (Scott) should not get “caught up in 
that.” After reading the response, Edwards withdrew his 
request with a plea to let Hanna- Attisha have access to the 
state’s data, and within an hour the two DHHS employees 
were congratulating one another on their success: 


9 


DHHS Peeler to DHHS Robert Scott: “Really nice email, 
thanks , ” 


DHHS Scott to DHHS Peeler: “Thanks-he sent a couple 

| x i i 

of responses that I’ll share on Monday . _ 1 ” 


An Agency “more Interested In public relations than 
sound science,” 


Three sets of e-mails involving Peeler and Scott, sent within 
a day of the above exchange, illustrate the unethical 
behavior occurring within DHHS at the time— all in the 
name of public relations and at the expense of sound 
science. 

1 ) “I’m Sure This One Is Not for the Public. ” 

Unbeknownst to Edwards, the day before he asserted in 
writing that DHHS was behaving unethically by hiding 
results to help cover up the problem and discredit the 
findings of Hurley’s Mona Hanna- Attisha- they were doing 
just that. At 3:45 pm on September 24 th , Scott wrote an e- 
mail entitled “ One more attempt to recreate Hurley.” 
The e-mail confirmed that Mona-Hanna Attisha’s analysis 
showing that blood lead had spiked after the switch to Flint 
River was verified with the DHHS data. But he also noted 
that “I’m sure this one is not for the public.” When 
informed that DHHS had knowledge supporting her 
analysis late last night, Hanna-Attisha confirmed that the 
state never did share those results with her- rather, the 
record shows DHHS was working full time to attack the 
idea there was any problem with childhood lead poisoning 
in Flint. 

2) DHHS Sends Scrubbed Data to Edwards, 
Hanna-Attisha and Dr. Reynolds (Mott Children’s 
Health Center): But Withholds Damning July 
Report. In response to Edwards request for the final data 
that supporting Brad Wurfel’s months of assertions that 
blood lead was not increase, Scott provided both Edwards 
and Hanna-Attisha with documentation. Unfortunately, it 
was not the final DHHS memo from late July— that report 
demonstrated that DHHS knew of a serious lead spike that 


10 




occurred in summer of 2014. Instead, Scott sent a revised 
version of the data that had been created just two days 
before, which had no mention of the statistically significant 
spike in childhood lead poisoning. Likewise, responding to 
an earlier request from Dr. Reynolds, DHHS considered 
sending the July report sent to the Directors Office and 
Governor, but instead sent a revised version of the data 
with no hint of problems with blood lead in Flint’s children. 


3) Peeler’s “Secret Hope” is Granted to Handle 
Free Press Reporter. Reporter Kristi Tanner from the 
Detroit Free Press was doing her own analysis of the Flint 
blood lead trends. Repeating the approach of Hanna- 
Attisha using DHSS data, comparing incidence of lead 
poisoning before to after the water switch, Tanner 
demonstrated a statistically significant increase in 
childhood lead poisoning. A flurry of DHHS e-mails to 
handle her analysis, went back and forth in DHSS-none of 
it considered acknowledging that she was correct. After all, 
Scott’s analysis showing the same thing, was surely “not 
for the public.” Instead, the following exchange occurred 
between Peeler, Scott and DHHS public relations. 

DHSS Peeler to DHSS Scott (September 25, 2015 1:20 pm): 


“I think Boh is the best person to speak to them 
about the lead data if you are comfortable with 
that Bob. My secret hope is that we can work in 
the fact that tins pattern, is smnlar to reeen.t past. 


■ « 


DHHS Scott promptly delivered a quote (9/25/2015 i:iq 
pm): 

“'While the trend for Michigan as a whole has 
shown a steady decrease in lead poisoning year 
by year , smaller areas such as the city of Flint 
have their bumps from year to year while still 
trending downwards overall. Does that sound 
reasonable?” 


11 



pm): 

i£ I like what you had to say . That’s basically what 
I told her , but she wants to hea r it from someone 

other than a spokesperson . JD Are you available 
for a call with her.” 

The smiley and happy faces inserted in the above e-mails, 
are indeed part of the original documents. To her credit, 

Tanner did not buy the states arguments , but did note the 
DHHS conclusion that the increase was “ seasonal and 
not related to the water supply .” 



By October 2 nd , the DHHS finally acknowledged that there 
was a serious problem in Flint. It confirmed that children 
living in the two zip codes (48503 and 48504) identified by 
Virginia Tech has having highest lead in water risks , also 

had increased incidence of c h ildhood lead poisoning after 
the switch to Flint River. Just as Hurely’s Mona— Hanna 
Attisha. had asserted. But they have never, to date, publicly 
released their in-house data demonstrating the extent of 
the problem. 

Our FOIA reveals a shocking DHHS graph created in 
October 2015. It shows the statistically significant spike in 
blood lead that occurred in summer 2014- the scientific 
result that DHHS has never publicly acknowledged. Even 
more horrifying, it also shows blood lead skyrocketing in 
summer of 2015, to the point where 9.5-12.5 percent of 
children in Flint’s two high risk zip codes were lead 
poisoned. Thi s is in the range of Hurle y ’s more recent 
estimatejhatmdfe 

some neighborhoods was as high as 15%. It goes without 
saying, surely, that this data was also “not for the public.” 


12 






Figure 2: DHHS graph showing skyrocketing blood lead in 
2nd and 3rd quarter of 2015, in two Flint zip codes 
identified by Virginia Tech as having highest water lead risk 



DHHS fought hard to delay release of these documents. 
After the legal time allowed for FOIA elapsed, and Edwards 
had paid for the request, DHSS fabricated claims of a 
“Litigation Hold” and “Attorney Client Privilege” as cause 
for further delays. We want to publicly thank Nanev Kaffer 
for pointing out the absurdity of these claims. We are also 
deeply indebted to Senator Ananich and his staff, who 

13 




fought for release of these documents to us late Friday 
night. 


MDHHS emails obtained via FOIA requests regarding blood lead 
levels of kids in Michigan, specifically in Flint 


These are the first batch of emails. We will possibly be 
releasing a second set sometime in January.

Subject: RE: Edwards Report Response 

With edits from the gov's team in bold.. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has consistently provided 
information regarding blood lead levels in the city of Flint. 

When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the 
increase appeared to be consistent with the routine seasonal fluctuation seen in the 
summer months. It wasn't until the Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists 
took a more in-depth look at the data by ZIP code, controlling for seasonal variation, and 
confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result of this process, we have 
determined that the way we analyze data needs to be thoroughly reviewed. 
Additionally, Gov. Rick Snyder has created a Flint Water Task Force to review all city, 
state and federal responses and actions and is expected to make recommendations 
moving forward. 

Our department is focused on ensuring that appropriate case management and follow 
up is occurring in Flint. Summary reports outlining blood lead level testing are posted 
online on a bi-weekly basis, and we are working closely with local partners to fulfill data 
requests as we receive them. 


Regarding the FOIA, Mr. Edwards received ail of the requested documents, with 
personal information redacted, on Friday, December 18.

• Lead is a potent neurotoxin with lifelong, 
multigenerational impacts 

• Blood lead levels (BLL) 5 ug/dL or more 
considered elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) 

» Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

• NO safe blood lead level 

• Disproportionately impacts low income and 
minority children 


Primary prevention is most important 


Primary Prevention 



“Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear to 
be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental and 
housing policies should encourage PREVENTION 
of all exposure to lead.” 



“Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary 
Prevention.” 2012 CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention. 


Impact on cognition 



Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

« Decrease in IQ 

An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low 
IQs (<70) 

Implications for early intervention, special education services, 
employment, incarceration, life achievement, etc

Quick Introduction to 





Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) 

• ACEs are potentially traumatic events that can have 
negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. 

• Also referred to as toxic stress or childhood trauma. 

• As number of ACEs increase, the risk for health 
problems increase in a strong and graded fashion. 

• An ACE score of 6 or more results in a 20 year 
decrease in life expectancy. 

• CDC ACE study 

• Kaiser Permanente from 1995 to 1997 with more than 
17,000 participants.

• Many chronic diseases/disparities in 
adults are determined decades earlier, by 
experiences in childhood (0-6 critical) 

• Lead exposure is an ACE/toxic stress

DRAFT Flint comms plan 

DRAFT Flint water communications plan.docx 


Take a look at this and then call me. Rich and I worked on this late on Dec. 23 and into Dec. 24. It was then run by senior 
staff for feedback on Dec. 24 and there have been some tweaks. The statement you'll see in the plan for Dec. 29 is in this 
document.

DRAFT: FLINT WATER PLAN 


Thursday, Dec. 24: Gov. calls Karen Weaver to set up a meeting 

Talking points: 

"I've read the draft of a report from the state's Office of the Auditor General and I've been briefed on 
the task force's progress in its ongoing investigation. 

"I want to work together with you to get this problem solved. As partners, we can get resources in place 
more quickly. 

"I want to assure you this isn't a political move on my part - I'm a problem solver and I intend to be your 
partner in addressing this to make it right. I'm truly sorry that all this has happened. 

"I have some ideas on how to get more resources for blood lead level testing and remediation - financial 
as well as state personnel, and I'd like to discuss those with you. 

"It sounds like you have a block of time available on the morning of Jan. 7. Would you be able to come 
to Lansing so we could talk between 9-10 a.m.? If so, I'll make sure Beth Emmitt, my scheduler, confirms 
with Maxine Murray." 

Saturday, Dec. 26, or Monday, Dec. 28: Getting organized 

We need to get the ball rolling on creating a healthy water communications team - potentially Mel 
Brown of TED and Ron Leix of MSP's Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division. Both are 
genuine and empathetic, and can convey information in a reassuring way. 

This duo would work with DHHS' and DEQ's respective communications teams, but also free up those 
teams to work on other issues not related to Flint water. The healthy water team would be the point 
people for anything concerning Flint water and lead issues, and will have the authority to assist Harvey 
Hollins, cut red tape for researchers who want access to DHHS and DEQ records, respond to media 
requests, edit and/or write press releases in conjunction with the Governor's communications team and 
more. 

Rich Baird or another appropriate person needs to discuss with Steve Arwood and Col. Etue about 
"borrowing" Mel and Ron. We would like to introduce these two at the January press conference with 
the Governor and Mayor Weaver, saying, "These are the folks who will answer questions and provide 
information to media and stakeholders about the Flint water crisis." 

Monday, Dec. 28, or Tuesday, Dec. 29: Asking researchers for help 

Nick Lyon reaches out to Virginia Tech researcher Marc Edwards and Hurley Hospital's Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha to help state lead and water experts who have worked on Flint's issues. The purpose is to share 
information, compare results and track how those results were reached to ensure best practices and 
accurate reporting. 

We'd ask this of Edwards and Hanna-Attisha: 

Your research has been eye opening and we're hoping you'll be willing to join an effort to 
ensure Flint's water is safe. 



We'd like you to sit down with state epidemiologists and other researchers so you can discuss 
lead levels and other issues related to the Flint water crisis. There have been variances and we 
want to be as accurate as possible. 

We want you to have as much access to our data as is possible under HIPPA laws so we can 
determine the extent of the problem. 

We want the team to brainstorm ways to get Flint's water back to safe levels for drinking, and to 
help families learn how they can mitigate any effects from lead. 

Once the water is safe, we want your help in showing the people of Flint that their water is 
drinkable. 

If you're willing to help, we'd like to announce this at a press conference in January and would 
love to have you both attend, if possible. 

In addition, Capt. Chris Kelenske and/or Nick Lyon need to explore more ways to help Flint, including the 
idea of an imminent danger declaration. Has MSHDA explored HUD grants to help families who need to 
upgrade their service lines? Are there other resources we can draw from? 

Tuesday, Dec. 29: Governor releases statement on Flint water 

This statement is meant to manage expectations on the timing of the report (probably another month at 
least) and to signal that action may come sooner than that (the Jan. 4 changes and those to be 
announced at the press conference). 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've 
read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQto monitor Flint 
water. 

"The bi-partisan taskforce has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and federal 
officials to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing hundreds of documents at all levels of 
government and from the public health science community. 

"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As they 
uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. Their report may take another month or so, but if 
we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this crisis. 

"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything we can to 
protect the well-being of our citizens. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific 
community. That is why I have told my directors at MDEQ and DHHS to invite every external scientist 
who has worked on the Flint water issue to the state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. 
Together, we should be able to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint 
residents have safe drinking water and that we're doing proper monitoring and remediation of blood 
levels and other health impacts over the long term. 

"I want the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has 
happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute 
water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going 
to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 



"What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure residents there that we will work hard to make 
things right." 

Monday, Jan. 4- Personnel changes 

Dave Murray talking point: "I can't speak to the specifics, but yes, there have been changes in personnel 
at the DEQ. We'll announce soon who you can contact to get information about Flint's water situation. 
For now, you can call me." 

Thursday, Jan. 7 - Meeting between the Governor and Mayor Karen Weaver 

Governor's talking point: "We had a great meeting today. Mayor Weaver had some great ideas that we 
want to flesh out. We'll announce soon how we plan to move forward in solving the problems with Flint 
water." 

Possibly Jan. 11 or 13 - Press conference with the Governor and Mayor Weaver to announce action 
plan 

Also in attendance: Point person Flarvey Hollins, Directors Nick Lyons and Dan Wyant, Capt. Chris 
Kelenske, Healthy Water communications team Mel Brown and Ron Leix, Sen. Jim Ananich, Rep. ???, 
Marc Edwards?, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who else? 

Talking points: 

Weaver announces more state money to help Flint and talks about how she's encouraged by the 
Governor's action plan and looks forward to working with Harvey Hollins. 

Harvey briefly describes his role - as the boots on the ground in Flint and the coordinator for state 
resources. 

Gov. Snyder reiterates his sadness over the situation and says it calls for extraordinary measures, which 
the state is prepared to make: 

o The state will form a team of independent and state water and lead level experts to go 
over the various results. The team will include Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards and Hurley 
Hospital's Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, along with state epidemiologists, DEQ experts, etc. 
o The team will have full access to DEQ and DHHS records. 

o Mel Brown and Ron Leix will be the Healthy Water team and serve as point people for 
all things Flint water and lead levels. 

o The state is exploring the best options to provide more help for Flint, including an 
imminent danger declaration, HUD grants for infrastructure improvements, etc. 
o We will document what we learn from this experience to help other cities with 
water/lead issues.

Subject: Update on OAG letter and our statement 


Colleagues, 

The Office of the Auditor General has released the letter. We've developed a statement, based on the 
summary you read the other night, that spells out how things came down. We hope media will pick up on the 
fact that the DEQ was largely following protocols, or in one case, an ambiguous one that EPA later clarified. 

FYI - Sen. Ananich has released the following in regard to the OAG letter: "The Auditor General has provided 
an important piece of this puzzle and I'm sure the extended report they are working on will reveal additional 
information," said Ananich. "What's clear is that corrosion control should have been used and there are 
serious failings in our system that must be addressed. Between the FOIA emails released recently and these 
findings, it's obvious that legislative oversight is the best way to see how all of these pieces fit together. I 
expect holding hearings to be high on the agenda when the Legislature returns." 

On Tuesday, we plan to release this statement by the Governor. It's been tweaked slightly since our review the 
other night, thanks to feedback from the Governor, Jim Redford and others. 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've read the 
report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 

"The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and federal officials 
to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing hundreds of documents at all levels of government 
and from the public health science community. 

"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As they uncover

make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action.

Subject: Attached Letter from Flint Water Advisory Task Force 

Dear Governor: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable time and effort to our review of the contamination of the Flint Water supply. Our 
focus has been on assessing what happened, why it happened, and what is needed to prevent any 
recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in the state. We have also, as you know, been assessing on-going 
mitigation efforts. 

Attached is a letter reporting our finding as to who bears the primary responsibility for what 
happened in Flint. We are sending this letter now because it has become clear to us that ascribing 
responsibility and ensuring accountability is both critical and urgent, and simply cannot wait for 
our final report. Establishing responsibility and accountability is the first step in re-establishing 
the trust between the citizens of Flint and their government and the agencies whose responsibility 


l 




it is to protect their health. The current level of distrust also serves to compromise the effective 
delivery of protected services designed to address ongoing public health issues. 

Thank you for the support you have given us and your demonstrated commitment to respond to 
our findings and recommendations. 

On behalf of the Task Force

December 29, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 



This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 
this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 

A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 


2 



legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 


We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 
time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 

We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDFIFIS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community. 

Respectfully yours.

As the Rachel Maddow Show reported on last night, the Flint water crisis is a terrible reminder that our state continues to exempt the

exemption from FOIA only making things worse... much worse. 

"Common Cause Michigan calls on the Governor to drop his executive privilege and submit all documents and correspondence in the 
executive office on all matters dealing with the Flint water crisis to Freedom of Information Act requests. The public deserves to know why 
Flint's children were poisoned with lead. In addition, Michigan should end special exemption from FOIA and subject the Governor's Office

dashboards featuring metrics for each department and creation of a citizen's guide to how state and local 
governments spend money. We're always focusing on continuous quality improvement in this area. 

The Governor also has promised complete cooperation with the independent Flint Water Task Force that is reviewing 
all state, local and federal actions related to the situation as the administration focuses on the health and welfare of 
people in Flint and across the state.
