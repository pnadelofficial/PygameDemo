RE: Phone Msg: Senator Ananich 


Re water theft, yes, it exists. 

Re EM crackdown, is he confusing Detroit with Flint? Probably not, but 3 hadn't heard re Flint either either. 

Here's the big, underlying issue: Flint wanted to spend less money on water so they switched away from DWSD. They 
then started to get boiling water advisories. They need more money to upgrade facilities, do treatment, etc, to prevent 
this. That means more money, and their whole point in the first place is that they needed to spend less. That means 
water rates go up. Then peopie don't pay, so water rates for everyone go up to offset that non-payment, it ends up 
being a vicious cycle in which water rates go up, so peopie can't afford it, so collections go down, so rates go up, in 
normal communities the cycle has a natural break point because we allow communities to put the equivalent of a tax 
lien on properties, and It is cheaper for peopie to pay their bill than lose their house, in Flint, Detroit, and a few other 
places, a water bill of a few thousand dollars may exceed the value of a house, so it actually worsens the problem 
Instead of stopping a vicious cycle.

Bear with my rattle off the top of my head response, as it was a three minute after session floow 
conversation....! tell you what he shared with me and you can decide if you’re the right person to have 
a conversation with him or not.... 

Basically he said that he doesn’t understand the decision of the Flint EM to amp up their efforts to go 
after those who are stealing water (I didn’t realize such a thing existed). He thinks that the focus 
should be first and foremost on safe drinking water, as they have had several boil advisories as of 
late. The senator said that at some point he feels as though he needs to come out and chastise the EM 
for prioritizing cracking down on water theft versus providing clean drinking water for citizens, 
thought he is reluctant to do that without an understanding of the thought process behind the 
decision. 

I did not tell him to call Rodney or you - I was going to check with Treasury, but apparently he didn't 
want to wait for that. 


Let me know what you think.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 

• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 

WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 


• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Comprehensive action plan 
will help Flint residents address water concerns 

Collaborative effort with state, federal and city leaders focuses on testing, assistance 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint residents need to have access to safe, clean, water now and long into the 
future, Gov. Rick Snyder said, announcing a comprehensive action plan created with state, 
federal and city leaders to address concerns about drinking water. 

The water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to drink, but some families with lead 
plumbing in their homes or service connections could experience higher levels of lead in the 
water that comes out of their faucets. 

The action plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional precautions for families 
with lead plumbing in their homes, and providing long-term solutions to address the city’s water 
infrastructure challenges. The plan was created at Snyder’s direction by the Michigan 
Departments of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Health and Human Services (DHHS), the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the city of Flint. 

“We are focused on helping ensure safe, clean, accessible drinking water and addressing and 
mitigating concerns and protecting public health,” Snyder said. “Today’s action plan builds upon 
ongoing work with local, state and federal agencies and our partnership with city and community 
leaders. Together, we are working to ensure that all Flint residents have accurate information 
and know that help is available to address potential problems.” 

The city and the state also are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that 
leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all 
residents. The plan includes: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately to ensure that drinking water is safe, with 
testing also available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

• Offering free water testing to Flint residents to assure their drinking water is safe. 

• Providing free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state 
assistance programs. 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes. 




• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines. 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee to ensure the best 
technology, practices and science are being followed by adding an expert from the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development to the group. 

• Naming Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services, as the Flint drinking water public health adviser. 

• Boosting a comprehensive lead education program to make sure residents have detailed 
information about how to protect themselves and their homes. 

Residents can have their water tested by calling 81 0-787-6537 and pressing 1 , or emailing 
flintwater@cityofflint.com . The DEQ is covering the cost of this testing. 

State leaders have been working closely with state and federal lawmakers to tap resources at 
all levels of government to address concerns. 

State health experts said there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in 
some specific communities. Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels of 
children in Flint have followed an expected seasonal trend. While this analysis for Flint as a 
whole remains true, a comprehensive and detailed review breaking down data by ZIP codes 
with the city revealed that MDHHS data is consistent with a study presented recently by Hurley 
Children’s Hospital. 

“While we cannot conclusively say that the water source change is the sole cause of the 
increase, this analysis supports our efforts as we take active steps to reduce all potential lead 
exposures in Flint,” MDHHS Director Nick Lyon said. “As part of this, we are working closely 
with our public and private partners to provide Flint residents on MDHHS assistance programs 
with free water filters and inform families about the steps they can take to reduce all lead 
exposures in their home.” 

As a part of the action plan, MDHHS is making National Sanitation Foundation certified water 
filters available to clients who are active Family Independence Program, Food Assistance 
Program, Child Development and Care or Social Security Insurance recipients. 

“This action plan offers concrete steps we will take in a local, state and federal partnership to 
ensure all Flint residents have safe water to drink,” DEQ Director Dan Wyant said. “The DEQ 
will work closely with the city to gather further data to ensure the water that leaves Flint’s system 
as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe to drink.”

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan 
Talking Points 

Overall Messaging 

• Repeated testing shows the water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to 
drink and meets all federal guidelines, including lead. 

• After the switch the Flint River, the compliance testing protocol yielded results of 
6 ppb in December 2014 and 1 1 ppb in June 2015. Both results were below the 
federal action level of 1 5 ppb. 

• However, we recognize some residents experience higher levels of lead in the 
water that comes out of their faucets because of lead plumbing in the home, and 
that’s a concern. 

• Out of an abundance of caution, we want to address the needs of all Flint 
families, and so we have developed an action plan that includes both short- and 
long-term solutions. 

• The state plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional 
precautions for families, and providing long-term solutions to address the city’s 
water infrastructure. 

Messaging regarding the action plan 

The city and the state are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that 
leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all 
residents. 

• Immediately test Flint public schools to ensure that drinking water is safe. 
Testing will also be available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

o Although Flint’s drinking water meets all federal requirements, the state 
wants to take extra steps to ensure that drinking water is safe for the city’s 
children. 

o The state will fund this testing (about $30,000) at no cost to the city or the 
local schools, and make the results publicly available. 

• Expand health exposure testing of individual residences. 

o To double-check its data as well as provide residents with an additional 
layer of assurance, the DEQ will conduct more tests at Flint properties. 

o The Technical Advisory Committee will determine the scope of this 
expanded testing. 

• Offer water testing at no cost to Flint residents to assure water is safe. 

o Although all testing indicates water in the city of Flint meets all federal 
standards, we understand some residents are concerned. 

o To ensure water in individual homes is safe, free water testing is available 
to all Flint residents. 

o We encourage anyone with a concern to get their water tested. 

o Contact the city water department to have your water tested. 

• Accelerate optimizing corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 




o A fully optimized corrosion control system can help coat the inside of pipes 
to minimize the amount of lead that enters the drinking water after it 
leaves the treatment plant. 

o This is a helpful step that can help minimize lead system-wide, and we’re 
pleased the city is moving to take this step. 

o If asked: This was not initially required because a fully optimized corrosion 
control system is not federally required in many water systems. Even 
today, since Flint is meeting all federal standards, this fully optimized 
system is not required. However, to address public concerns and ensure 
every possible precaution is taken, the city is moving forward with 
installing this corrosion control system. 

Expand the “Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee” to 
ensure the best technology, practices and science are being utilized, and 
add an expert from the EPA’s Office of Research and Development to the 
group. 

o The Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 7 to 
discuss fully optimizing the corrosion control system, expanding testing of 
at-risk properties, and other topics. 

o Tom Burke, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of 
Research and Development as well as the EPA’s Science Advisor, will 
participate on the committee. Prior to joining EPA, he held prominent 
positions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and 
founded the Johns Hopkins Risk Sciences and Public Policy Institute. He 
brings substantial expertise, and we’re pleased he is able join the 
committee. 

Accelerate water system improvements to address replacement of lead 
service lines. 

o Regardless of the drinking water source - whether it be DWSD, the Flint 
River or Lake Huron - the only permanent fix for lead is to replace all 
18,000 of the private lead service lines in the city. These are the lines on 
private property that lead from the curb to individual homes. 

o This is a problem in communities statewide, and one we want to address 
with a long-term solution. 

o The state and EPA are working together to find a way for the city to 
access Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds for the work. 

Expedite completion of Karegnondi Water Authority. 

o The move to the Flint River was always a temporary measure until the 
connection to the KWA and to Lake Huron was completed. 

o This is the ultimate goal of the venture, and the state and locals will work 
together to speed up completion of the connection. 

o 

Name Dr. Eden Wells as Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor. 

o Dr. Wells is the Director for the Preventive Medicine Residency at the 
University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor as well as the 
Chief Medical Executive for MDHHS. 



o 


She brings years of experience in epidemiology and preventative medicine 
to the issue, and we’re thrilled to have her expertise. 

o Dr. Wells will coordinate with Hurley Medical Center to share data on 
blood lead levels in children, as well as address other emerging issues. 

Provide water filters to residents of Flint. 

o As an additional precaution, water filters will be available to low-income 
families. 

o This provides another safeguard to ensure everyone in the city of Flint has 
access to clean drinking water that they feel confident drinking. 

Expand a comprehensive lead education initiative. 

o Lead plumbing is common in homes built prior to 1986, and anyone in the 
state with lead pipes in their home can take some extra precautions to 
minimize lead in their drinking water. 

o It takes time for lead to accumulate in drinking water from plumbing, and 
so flushing your pipes prior to using them can minimize your exposure. 

■ To flush your pipes, run the water until it’s as cold as it will go. This 
can take as little as 5 to 30 seconds if you have recently flushed the 
toilet or otherwise used water in your home, or as long as 2 to 5 
minutes if you have not used any water in hours. 

■ In the city of Flint, running the water for 5 minutes only costs about 
3-16 cents, depending on your faucet. 

o Additionally, more lead gets into hot water than cold water. Use only cold 
water for drinking, cooking and making baby formula.

Subject: Phelps press release 

Just FYI- Rep. Phelps put out this press release today. http;//hpysederns.^ 

Sally said that Treasury recevied his request on September 8th, sent him a letter to the address listed on the request on 
the 15 lh saying they would need until the 29 th to respond and sent a letter of response on 29 lh to the address listed. I 
believe she said they were coordinating with DEQ. I don't have a copy of their response, but can get it for you 
tomorrow, if interested. 

Please let me know if you need any other information. Sally has reached out to Rep. Phelps. 

Thanks, 

M.

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 


i 



At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
co nd u cted , visit www.michigan.gov/flinfwater. 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@.michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, or by emailing 

flintwater@cityofflint.com .

www.michig a n.g o v/flintwater. 

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 


2 



assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 


On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 
provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

Subject: City of Flint - correspondence regarding reconnection to Water Supply System 

Attached is a letter that was sent to the City of Flint today regarding possible reconnection to the 
Water Supply System in response to an initial inquiry by Ms. Henderson, Flint's City 
Administrator and Ms. McCormick. As you may imagine the dialog that has begun is at a very 
preliminary stage, available information may be limited and outdated to some degree, and Ms. 
Henderson has asked that we not make a public release at this time. With that request in mind, 
we have asked the communications team to refer all press call to either Ms. McCormick or me. 
We will keep you updated as this issue develops.

Ms, Natasha L. Henderson, City Administrator 

City o f Flint 

1101 S. Saginaw St. 

Flint, Michigan 48502 

Dear Ms. Henderson; 

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the possibility of reconnecting the City ofFlintto the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department’s (DWSD) Water Supply system.. Director McCormick has asked 
me to respond to you and provide a brief outline of the basis for that reconnection. However, 1 
want to again emphasize what Ms. McCormick has previously stated to your City Council on this 
issue: DWSD is willing to sit down and talk with the City of Flint without pre-condition, if that is 
mutually desirable, 

1 would be remiss if I did not point out that on June 12, 2015, the City of Detroit and the Great 
Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) executed a Lease Agreement that provides for the GLWA’s 
operation of the Regional Water Supply System. At present, we are transitioning management of 
the: system from DWSD to the GLWA while certain Conditions Precedent of the Lease Agreement 
are satisfied. We have made substantial progress towards satisfying these Conditions Precedent 
with a goal of having GLWA commence full system operations on or before January 1, 2016. I 
can assure you that, like DWSD, the GLWA is concerned with the challenges Flint’s residents 
have faced in recent months, and will be willing to discuss service to your City , 

That said, here is a likely list of issues that would need to be addressed: 

1) Rates : In Sue McCormick’s January 12, 2015 letter to Flint, she indicated that the 
rates Flint would pay for the remainder of the then current 2014-2015 Fiscal Year (FY) 
would be “the same rates Flint was paying as a terminated customer when it left the 
system but modified to include the 4% increase experienced by all other DWSD 
wholesale customers in 2014,” As we are- now in the: 2015-16 FY, that offer must be 
modified to include an additional adjustment similar to that which was received by other 
customers, In this regard we propose that the rates be adjusted as follows: 

a) Starting with the 2013-2014 FY terminated rate; and 

b) Adding a 4% adjustment to that rate to account for the .2014-2015 FY increases: and 

e) Adding an adjustment equal to the average Suburban Wholesale Charge: Adjustment 
for the current 2015-20:16 FY. This rate would remain in place until June 30, 2016, the 
end of the current 2015-201 6 FY. 



Ms, Natasha L. Henderson, City Ad m inis t rat or 
City of Mint 
September 30, 2015 

Page 2 ------ — 


d) Based upon the above considerations, the resulting rate structure is a fixed monthly 
rate of $662, 1 00 and a commodity rate of $8.937Mef for the current 201 5-201 6 PY. Please 
note that this rate structure is designed to be applicable to incremental water sales over and 
above water sales to the Genesee County Drain Commission, Depending on how water is 
provided to the combined 0CD C/Flint customer, alternative rate structures may be 
appropriate. 

e) Additionally, DWSD recently changed its wholesale customer billing methodology as 
follows; Hint’s calculated share of the PY 2016 Budget is allocated 60% to the Fixed 
Monthly Charge and 40% to the Commodity Charge, which is consistent with the 
adopted FY 2015-2016 water wholesale rates 

1) In extending this proposal, our assumption is that the service provided is to Flint only 
and computations are based on data from our previous customer relationship. 

g) It is anticipated that under the management of the GLWA, the rates for the 2016-2017 
FY Will be computed using the same methodology as applied to all other Water Supply 
System customers:. 

The proposed rate methodology is intended to ensure that Flinfis treated fairly by using foe average 
wholesale customer adjustment in the current Fiscal Year, and the same methodology as all other 
customers. 

2) Term ; DWSD understands that Flint’s current long-term desire is to receive water 
service from foe KWA. Under these circumstances, Flint would be expected to remain a 
DWSD customer from the time of reconneetion until foe time it begins to receive service 
from KWA. If Flint washes to consider a longer term relationship with DWSD or 
G I AVA, we would welcome that discussion. 

3) Reconnection : As previously indicated by Ms, McCormick in her January 12, 2015, 
letter, DWSD will not charge an additional fee for Flint to reconnect to foe DWSD Water 
System, and is prepared to immediately take those steps necessary on its end to facilitate 
a reconnection. Any expenses incurred would be billed at actual cost. Because DWSD 
lacks sufficient information on the status of the disconnection, we are unable to provide 
an estimate of those costs at this time, Nonetheless, we will work with you in good faith 
to develop art expedited plan for reconnection, and to develop a mutually agreed good 
faith es timate of the costs associated wi th that plan. 

Thank you for raising this issue with us. We hope that this letter addresses the concerns you raised 
during your recent conversation with Ms. McCormick, and we sincerely appreciate your interest 
and foe opportunity to serve Flint.

Finally, we look forward to the opportunity to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss 
this letter, and how we may best assist Flint in serving its residents' needs. Please contact Ms. 
McCormick's office at (3 1 3) 224-4701 to arrange this meeting. 

Best Regards,

EM SUBMISSION NO. : £L0t32PlQ <// 
PRESENTED ; 3 ^3 

ADOPTED: 




BY THE EMERGENCY MANAGER: 

RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY FROM 
KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the ICWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2,1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw. 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Bach party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract, 

It is in the long term best interests of the City of Flint to enter into a contract with the 
KWA to purchase up to eighteen (1 8) units of capacity. 



i 


IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase up to eighteen ( 18 ) units of capacity, 

IT IS FURTHER- RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, with approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Hint City Council meeting Monday, March 25 

[http!//www.mlive,com/news/flint/iiidex,ssf/20i3/o3/flin.t_eity_council_again_delay.html] , may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it 
to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Wailing said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint 
River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution, 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River 
Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at risk of haring to start releasing water 
from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste advisory board. The 
KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined 
the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eiglit years 

[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/i11dex.ssf/20i3/03/flb1t._city._cotmcy._jJelays_decLl1tn1I] by getting water from the 
KWA. 

"It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because 
there will be increased treatment cost for the river water,” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water 
plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County,- however, the plant only operates four times 
per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote.

"It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. "I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option.’ 1 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee* Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials 
said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized,

What: Jeff Wright Statement on Flint City Council Approving Resolution to Join KWA. 
When: March 26, 2013 


Additional Info: Jeff Wright, CEO of the KWA, today praised the Flint City Council for voting to approve 
a resolution to officially have the City of Flint join the KWA and its' water line, 

"I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint's City Council and Mayor," said 
Wright. "I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the 
residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials." The next step in the 
■ process will come with the KWA Board executing the contract for the City. /=i 

"The most important aspect from the vote Is the fact that we as an Authority can move forward 
knowing Flint's intentions," said Wright. 

Despite Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz publicly supporting the project, Wright had made a vote by 
council a condition of Flint joining the KWA so the residents would have their say. 

"There is a basic tenet that government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the councfi 
vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, 
should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside of their community," said Wright. 

At the next Water and Waste Advisory Board meeting a vote will be taken to award a contract for 
construction of the intake portion of the water line. Ail bids were submitted to the board at their last 
meeting for review.

water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 15, 2013. As such, this approval 
will be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012, 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA,

Flint council supports buying water from Lake Huron 
through KWA

FLINT, M I — Flint residents may soon get their water from Lake Huron. 

The Fiint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority, 

"This is about compromise," said Councilman Sheldon Neeley. 

Neeley got support from Councilman Joshua Freeman, after the two were previously at odds about the amount the city should withdraw 
from Lake Huron, 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone "no" vote. 


"It was a protest vote," Nolden said. "I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner said construction of the pipeline could start in May. 

The city currently pays to get its water from Detroit. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved.

AMENDED RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY 
FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


BY THE MAYOR: 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

The City of Flint has decided that it is in its long term best interests to enter into a 
contract with the KWA to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity ; plus TWO (2) units from 
the Flint River. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from the Flint River. 


IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA infonnation needed to administer the contract and, with approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

Re: Goals for Task Force 

Flint Water Task Force.draftscope.211015_MMD.docx 


Team - 

Please find my initial draft of questions for us to consider, added to Ken's draft that he circulated earlier. 

For our agenda on Wed, I would highlight the importance of: 

1 - OMA/FOIA 

2 - Our need for awareness about others' assessments in this same space — although there is virtually no way that we will be 
fully aware of all others' activities (investigatory, journalistic, legal) in this arena, being aware of the "official" inquiries may 
potentially assist us in tapping others' fact-finding (e.g., MDEQ's internal review to be completed within 30 days). We need a 
"map" (or perhaps a Venn diagram). 

3 - As this is still a new group, it may be helpful for us to take 5 mins to share what, for each of us, would represent "success" 
in the deliverables for this task force. 

An additional question about logistics: 

Are we anticipating the need to keep our own minutes — and if yes, should we rotate that role? Or is there the possibility of 
having a staff member dedicated to this purpose — perhaps from PSC, or the Env Council, or my research unit at UM (or 
elsewhere), with modest support for this purpose from the Gov's office? 

Matt

Subject: Re: Goals for Task Force 


Y'all, 

Without having had an opportunity to review Ken's contribution, I thought I would pass along my initial cut at some thoughts 
on questions / work plan for your review and consideration. I would like to flesh this out further but this may give some idea 
of the questions / approach ideas that arose during my weekend reading sessions. 

As for agenda ideas, a few items — some of which have already been noted: 

• Basecamp orientation (5 min) 

• OMA / FOIA review (already identified) 

• Protocol for addressing issues that may identify potential liabilities 

• Defining how our review differs/complements/ etc the seeming multitude of other reviews 

• Calendar 





Lastly, a couple of clarifications / apologies regarding Basecamp: 


1. By way of apology, I live under the illusion that my home is in Chicago and so my computer is set to Central Standard 
Time. On my calendar, our meeting on Wed. shows up as 10:00 a.m. but I think Basecamp converted it to 11:00 EST 
on your machines. My apologies for the confusion — and thanks to Ken for the correction. 

2. We have set up 2 projects (so far) in Basecamp. The first is just for us — the Flint Water Advisory Task Force (and Rich 
B.). I thought this might be useful if we wanted to be able to have exchanges among the core task force 
membership. The second project, Flint Water Review, includes everyone that was on the earlier distributed roster 
(and their aides). Sorry for any confusion there. 


I will also post the attached to the task force project — and hope to have some further thoughts /revisions tomorrow night. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

(DRAFT) 

FLINT WATER ADVISORY TASK FORCE 
AFTER-ACTION REVIEW 


The Flint Water Task Force is an independent advisory panel appointed by Governor 
Rick Snyder charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and 
with offering recommendations for future guidelines to protect the health and safety of 
all state residents. 

The task force expects to summarize its work in a report to be presented to Governor 
Rick Snyder within ninety (90) days. 

GOALS 

The Flint Water Task Force’s goals are as follows: 

• Complete a thorough review of all steps taken by state and local officials 

regarding the decision to switch the City of Flint’s water source to the Flint River 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s system (DWSD). 

- Produce a timeline of actions 

i. Include in this timeline the activity and information provided by * -- ( Formatted ] 

individuals and entities “outside” of government, such as those by 

Marc Edwards. Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, and others. 

ii. Also include in the timeline: when the decision had been made to 
use DWSD water (ie, for how long had Flint used DWSD): whether 
there had been previous concerns raised about water qualitv/safetv 
in Flint with DWSD as source 

- Establish why each action was taken 

i. W ere d ecisions a nd actions based on adequate and relev a nt - (Formatted J 

inform at ion? If not, why not? 

ii. Who was responsible for making decisions about the switch to Flint 
River? Were there other individuals who should have been 
involved who were not? 

iii. Were there individuals who were involved in the decision to switch 
to the Flint River who should not have been? 

iv. If decisions and actions were wrong, why were they wrong? 

- What steps could have been taken that might have preventing the problem 
from occurring? 

Are there examples from other cities (eg. District of Columbia) that 
could/should have provided guidance or cautionary tales? If yes, were 
there indications that personnel involved in the switch to Flint River were 

aware of such examples?. [_ D elet ed: j 

: Did “early warning signs” occur tha t were either ignored or simply not 

viewed as reasons for concern? 


October 21, 2015, Draft 



- If “early warning signs” were observed - who observed them and to whom 
were they reported? Were such signs part of routine surveillance or ad 
hoc surveillance/measurements? 

- Was there a wav to test the switch to the Flint River as a drinking water 
source, including testing at the faucet, prior to full implementation? 

- The preceding question presumes that there may be protocols in place to 
test water at its source and also at its destination - did such protocols 
exist in Flint with the switch to Flint River? If yes, were they followed and 
what was found; and if they exist but were not followed, why not? 

- What was the status of the Flint Water T r eat ment Plant p rior to the switch? 
Was it being utilized? Sitting idle? What is current status of the plant, now 
that switch has been made back to DWSD? 


Review the roles of the federal, state, and local officials in the decision-making 
process 

2_ Is it clear who is responsible to ensure safe drinking water? 

- Is i t cl ear what s hould be done and by whom in certain situations - eg, 

when water sources are changed? when concerns are raised about water 
safetv/puritv? 

z Identify best practices for federal, state, and local officials to work together 

in future similar situations 

- Identify existing responsibility / accountability across different agencies 
within government levels (federal, state, local) vis-a-vis HEALTH (eg, 
MDHHS) versus WATER QUALITY/SAFETY (eg, MDEQ) 

- Evaluate where coordination between these entities could have been 

better, and how it could be improved 

- How did the hybrid local/state model of decision-making in Flint under a 
state-appointed emergency manager affect the responsiveness and 
decision-making regarding the Flint River? T 

- Evaluate federal, state, and local response to other entities and individuals 
who were testing Flint drinking water in substance, timing, and tone 

- What would have happened — if anything — if private testing had not been 
done and results m ade public or shared with public entities?^ 

- ^\sk and evaluate the following Question: “Even if “best practices” were 
utiliz ed an d good coordination between federal, state, and local officials 
had taken place, would the prob lem likely have occurred an yway. because 
of inadequate law and/or regulations? 

- Have other cities in the United States experienced similar problems? How 
did they address them? Can we learn from these other experiences?

- Determine whether the proper procedures were followed 

- Assuming proper procedures were not followed. .. .if they had been 
followed, would the problem have be e n prevented? 

- Where proper EXISTING procedures WERE followed ... were there gaps

Happy Thanksgiving all. Looks like there is sneed for a media update. 

You may hear some grumbles about the pre-registration requirement for the Listening Session 12/2 at 
Mott. This was based on logistical considerations - availability, cost, safety and secure parking. Also , to give 40 
people 2-3 minutes to speak will require 80-120 minutes time and this does not lend itself to an open town hall 
meeting format if we are going to effectively listen to and discuss with participants. 

I would suggest that we use funds to record and transcribe these session and a video of it be available on a 
website ,open to the public. See below. 

We will need some help with hosting identifying speakers, bringing the microphone to them , registration , 
etc .Would this be a role for MSU ? This group should make an effort to reflect the diversity of Flint. 


For video recording .consider Paul Herring , SpectacleP roductions, 405 University Blvd .Flint, 


office 


www. spectacleproductions. com . 


If we have more registrants than space , we can put them on the list for subsequent meetings which must occur 


in a timely manner. 


If we consider other sites, consider the requirements for public buildings in regard to open meetings. 


l 






It may be time to officially contact Mayor Weaver about our plans and suggest to the Governor that we need 
an official representative to clarify our role and our intent to not conflict with the Mayor's public 
meetings. Perhaps , we need to be available to attend some of her meetings to listen also. 

Finally, our electrical power was shut off for maintenance that had to be completed before freezing weather so 
phones and computers were down. We will be open for business Monday 12/30. 

We are operating on a tight timeline and will need more resources and some media support to reflect the 
Governor's concern adequately to the citizens of Flint.

Subject: ACTION NEEDED on Flint water documents 


Good afternoon Governor, 



Sony for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHHS is hoping to issue the release this 
afternoon to avoid issuing news on Friday, The DHHS team has answered the questions 
and made significant revisions to the press release at my request. I think this is far more 
reader friendly and people focused. 


Here are the specific answers to the questions: 


Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to lead 
sources is reduced. The purpose of screening children for lead is to identify those with 
elevated levels. Removing potential sources of lead exposure and ensuring proper 
nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in blood lead levels in follow-up testing, 
which is an important part of case management. Lead has a half-life in blood of 
approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 days; and in the non-labile portion of 
bone, more than 25 years. 


Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the 
third quarter of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a 
number of factors including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer 
months. 


DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr. Wells available to answer questions. 


Thank you for your consideration. 


Dave 


The notifications will be timed as follows: 


1:30 p.m. 



Send final embargoed release and summary report to: 


o Genesee County Health Department - Geralyn Lasher 
o Dr. Mona Hannah- Attisha - Geralyn Lasher

I have located $25,000 to assist in paying for the FWATF communications needs. I would like 
added to the scope of work for them to update the Local Emergency Operations Support Plan (Pub 
204) and train and exercise the plan with appropriate personnel. I attached the template we 
provide locals to use in developing the plan. Flint has a plan in place but with everything going on 
and based on interactions recently I am not convinced it is followed or if they even know about it. 

I am certain the new Mayor is not aware of the Local Support Plan. 


Please let me know if you need additional on this or have questions.

Here is a rough draft of a communications plan for the next several days. I came up with what may be a bizarre 
idea - creating a Healthy Water communications team (potentially made up of Ron and Mel). You'll see it 
addressed in the plan. It'll temporarily fill the vacuum left by Brad and circumvent, frankly, the team in place at 
DHHS. Dave and I have tried to humanize their press releases, to little avail. What ends up going out is 
jargonish and institutional. The Healthy Water team would free the DHHS staff up to message on issues other 
than Flint water, yet Ron and Mel would still work with them to ensure accuracy. 

I'm not easily offended. Rich, so if you think this plan is hooey or it's not what you need, let me know and I'll 
take another shot.

DRAFT: FLINT WATER PLAN 


Thursday, Dec. 24: Gov. calls Karen Weaver to set up a meeting 

Talking points: 

I've read the draft of a report from the state's Office of the Auditor General and I've been briefed on the 
taskforce's progress in its ongoing investigation. 

I want to work together with you to get this problem solved. As partners, we can get resources in place 
more quickly. 

I want to assure you this isn't a political move on my part - I'm a problem solver and I want to make this 
right. I'm truly sorry that all this has happened. 

It sounds like you have a block of time available on the morning of Jan. 7. Would you be able to come to 
Lansing so we could talk between 9-10 a.m.? If so, I'll make sure Beth Emmitt, my scheduler, confirms 
with Maxine Murray. 

Saturday, Dec. 26, or Monday, Dec. 28: RB and others start organizing action plan 

RB talks to Nick Lyon and Dan Wyant about messaging changes and embedding a healthy water 
communications team - potentially Mel Brown and Ron Leix. This duo would work with those 
departments' respective communications teams, but also free up those teams to work on other 
issues not related to Flint water. The healthy water team would be the point people for anything 
concerning Flint water and lead issues, and will have the authority to assist Flarvey Hollins, cut 
red tape for researchers who want access to DFIHS and DEQ records, respond to media requests, 
edit and/or write press releases in conjunction with the Governor's communications team and 
more. 

RB explores with Dan whether the in-house choice to take over the Office of Drinking Water and 
Municipal Assistance is the appropriate choice. 

RB or someone else talks to Steve Arwood and Col. Etue about "borrowing" Mel and Ron. We 
need to get the ball rolling. I'd love to put them out there at the January presser saying, "These 
are the folks who will answer questions and provide information to media and stakeholders 
about the Flint water crisis." 

Monday, Dec. 28, or Tuesday, Dec. 29: Harvey Hollins reaches out to researchers 

Harvey Hollins reaches out to Marc Edwards and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha to serves on a task force that 
includes the state and independent water experts who have worked on Flint water issues. The purpose 
is to share information, compare results and track how those results were reached to ensure best 
practices and accurate reporting. 

Talking points for Hollins in his ask of Edwards and Hanna-Attisha: 

Your research has been eye opening and we're hoping you'll be willing to join an effort to 
ensure Flint's water is safe. 

We'd like you to sit down with state epidemiologists and other researchers so you can discuss 
lead levels and other issues related to the Flint water crisis. There have been variances and we 
want to be as accurate as possible. 



We want you to have as much access to our data as is possible under HIPPA laws so we can 
determine the extent of the problem. 

We want the team to brainstorm ways to get Flint's water back to safe levels for drinking, and to 
help families learn how they can mitigate any effects from lead. 

Once the water is safe, we want your help in showing the people of Flint that their water is 
drinkable. 

In addition, Capt. Chris Kelenske explores ways to help Flint, including the idea of an imminent danger 
declaration. Has MSHDA explored HUD grants to help families who need to upgrade their service lines? 

Tuesday, Dec. 29: Governor releases statement on Flint water 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've 
read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEO to monitor Flint 
water. 

"While DEQ followed many of the appropriate protocols, it's not surprising at this point to learn that 
corrosion controls should have been maintained when switching from Detroit to Flint River water. I've 
talked with DEQ Director Wyant and have told him I want Michigan to be the state that is known for the 
safest water in the nation. 

"I want to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As they 
uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. The report may take another month or so, but if 
we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action. 

"The bottom line is we'll take responsibility for our part in Flint's water crisis. Moving forward, I vow to 
make sure that Flint citizens will have safe drinking water. And I'm so very sorry that this happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute 
water filters, mitigate high lead levels in affected families and inspect plumbing in schools and health 
facilities. 

"I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver last Thursday, and we're going to sit down in the next week to 
discuss other ways the state can best offer help. 

"What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure the residents of Flint that we will work hard to 
make things right." 

Monday, Jan. 4- Personnel changes 

Dave Murray talking point: "I can't speak to the specifics, but yes, there have been changes in personnel 
at the DEQ. We'll announce soon who you can contact to get information about Flint's water situation. 
For now, you can call me." 

Thursday, Jan. 7 - Meeting between the Governor and Mayor Karen Weaver 

Governor's talking point: "We had a great meeting today. Mayor Weaver had some great ideas that we 
want to flesh out. We'll announce soon how we plan to move forward in solving the problems with Flint 
water." 

Possibly Jan. 11 or 13 - Press conference with the Governor and Mayor Weaver to announce action 
plan 



Also in attendance: Point person Harvey Hollins, Directors Nick Lyons and Dan Wyant, Capt. Chris 
Kesenske, Healthy Water communications team Mel Brown and Ron Leix, Sen. Jim Ananich, Rep. ???, 
Marc Edwards?, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who else? 

Talking points: 

Weaver announces more state money to help Flint and how she looks forward to working with Harvey 
Hollins. 

Harvey talks about how he'll be the boots on the ground in Flint and will coordinate with Lansing 
resources. 

Gov. Snyder reiterates his sadness over the situation and says it calls for extraordinary measures, which 
the state is prepared to make: 

o The state will form a team of independent and state water and lead level experts to go 
over the various results. The team will include Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards and Hurley 
Hospital's Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, along with state epidemiologists, DEQ experts, etc. 

o The team will have full access to DEQ and DHHS records. 

o Mel Brown and Ron Leix will be the Healthy Wat4er team and serve as point people for 
all things Flint water and lead levels. Their roles will be explained. 

o The state is exploring the best options to provide more help for Flint, including an 
imminent danger declaration, HUD community block grants for infrastructure 
improvements, etc. 

o We will document what we learn from this experience to help other cities with 
water/lead issues.

DRAFT: FLINT WATER PLAN 


Thursday, Dec. 24: Gov. calls Karen Weaver to set up a meeting 

Talking points: 

"I've read the draft of a report from the state's Office of the Auditor General and I've been briefed on 
the task force's progress in its ongoing investigation. 

"I want to work together with you to get this problem solved. As partners, we can get resources in place 
more quickly. 

"I want to assure you this isn't a political move on my part - I'm a problem solver and I intend to be your 
partner in addressing this to make it right. I'm truly sorry that all this has happened. 

"I have some ideas on how to get more resources for blood lead level testing and remediation - financial 
as well as state personnel, and I'd like to discuss those with you. 

"It sounds like you have a block of time available on the morning of Jan. 7. Would you be able to come 
to Lansing so we could talk between 9-10 a.m.? If so, I'll make sure Beth Emmitt, my scheduler, confirms 
with Maxine Murray." 

Saturday, Dec. 26, or Monday, Dec. 28: Getting organized 

We need to get the ball rolling on creating a healthy water communications team - potentially Mel 
Brown of TED and Ron Leix of MSP's Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division. Both are 
genuine and empathetic, and can convey information in a reassuring way. 

This duo would work with DHHS' and DEQ's respective communications teams, but also free up those 
teams to work on other issues not related to Flint water. The healthy water team would be the point 
people for anything concerning Flint water and lead issues, and will have the authority to assist Harvey 
Hollins, cut red tape for researchers who want access to DHHS and DEQ records, respond to media 
requests, edit and/or write press releases in conjunction with the Governor's communications team and 
more. 

Rich Baird or another appropriate person needs to discuss with Steve Arwood and Col. Etue about 
"borrowing" Mel and Ron. We would like to introduce these two at the January press conference with 
the Governor and Mayor Weaver, saying, "These are the folks who will answer questions and provide 
information to media and stakeholders about the Flint water crisis." 

Monday, Dec. 28, or Tuesday, Dec. 29: Asking researchers for help 

Nick Lyon reaches out to Virginia Tech researcher Marc Edwards and Hurley Hospital's Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha to help state lead and water experts who have worked on Flint's issues. The purpose is to share 
information, compare results and track how those results were reached to ensure best practices and 
accurate reporting. 

We'd ask this of Edwards and Hanna-Attisha: 

Your research has been eye opening and we're hoping you'll be willing to join an effort to 
ensure Flint's water is safe. 



We'd like you to sit down with state epidemiologists and other researchers so you can discuss 
lead levels and other issues related to the Flint water crisis. There have been variances and we 
want to be as accurate as possible. 

We want you to have as much access to our data as is possible under HIPPA laws so we can 
determine the extent of the problem. 

We want the team to brainstorm ways to get Flint's water back to safe levels for drinking, and to 
help families learn how they can mitigate any effects from lead. 

Once the water is safe, we want your help in showing the people of Flint that their water is 
drinkable. 

If you're willing to help, we'd like to announce this at a press conference in January and would 
love to have you both attend, if possible. 

In addition, Capt. Chris Kelenske and/or Nick Lyon need to explore more ways to help Flint, including the 
idea of an imminent danger declaration. Has MSHDA explored HUD grants to help families who need to 
upgrade their service lines? Are there other resources we can draw from? 

Tuesday, Dec. 29: Governor releases statement on Flint water 

This statement is meant to manage expectations on the timing of the report (probably another month at 
least) and to signal that action may come sooner than that (the Jan. 4 changes and those to be 
announced at the press conference). 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've 
read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQto monitor Flint 
water. 

""The bi-partisan taskforce has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and federal 
officials to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing hundreds of documents at all levels of 
government and from the public health science community. 

"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As they 
uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. Their report may take another month or so, but if 
we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this crisis. I want 
Michigan to be the state that is known for the safest water in the nation. 

""When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for error in testing for 
lead and other toxins. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community. That is 
why I have told my directors at MDEQ and DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on 
the Flint water issue to the state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should 
be able to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe 
drinking water and that we're doing proper monitoring and remediation of blood levels and other health 
impacts over the long term. 

"I want the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has 
happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute 
water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going 
to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 



"What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure residents there that we will work hard to make 
things right." 

Monday, Jan. 4- Personnel changes 

Dave Murray talking point: "I can't speak to the specifics, but yes, there have been changes in personnel 
at the DEQ. We'll announce soon who you can contact to get information about Flint's water situation. 
For now, you can call me." 

Thursday, Jan. 7 - Meeting between the Governor and Mayor Karen Weaver 

Governor's talking point: "We had a great meeting today. Mayor Weaver had some great ideas that we 
want to flesh out. We'll announce soon how we plan to move forward in solving the problems with Flint 
water." 

Possibly Jan. 11 or 13 - Press conference with the Governor and Mayor Weaver to announce action 
plan 

Also in attendance: Point person Flarvey Hollins, Directors Nick Lyons and Dan Wyant, Capt. Chris 
Kelenske, Healthy Water communications team Mel Brown and Ron Leix, Sen. Jim Ananich, Rep. ???, 
Marc Edwards?, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who else? 

Talking points: 

Weaver announces more state money to help Flint and talks about how she's encouraged by the 
Governor's action plan and looks forward to working with Harvey Hollins. 

Harvey briefly describes his role - as the boots on the ground in Flint and the coordinator for state 
resources. 

Gov. Snyder reiterates his sadness over the situation and says it calls for extraordinary measures, which 
the state is prepared to make: 

o The state will form a team of independent and state water and lead level experts to go 
over the various results. The team will include Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards and Hurley 
Hospital's Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, along with state epidemiologists, DEQ experts, etc. 
o The team will have full access to DEQ and DHHS records. 

o Mel Brown and Ron Leix will be the Healthy Water team and serve as point people for 
all things Flint water and lead levels. 

o The state is exploring the best options to provide more help for Flint, including an 
imminent danger declaration, HUD grants for infrastructure improvements, etc. 
o We will document what we learn from this experience to help other cities with 
water/lead issues.

I offer a few thoughts, and some of these may be incredibly naive, but we seem to be in a 
brainstorming mode: 


■ Should we include MSHDA in the mix of departments involved in this? They administer the 

Community Development Block Grant program and this may call for some of that money. 

■ It might be prudent to reach out to Sen. Ananich, Rep. Neeley and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee to see if 

they would like representatives from their offices on any of these committees. 

■ We still need to convey better the extent of the problem. So maybe this is a communications issue 

more than anything else, because I do know testing is going on. I don’t know HOW it’s going 
on, so I offer these suggestions, realizing they may already be happening or are totally 
unrealistic: 

The goal: Assess the extent of the elevated blood lead levels - the number of those affected and 
the degree to which they’re affected 

■ Get as many people in the affected zip codes tested as possible - can the Red Cross or some other 

agency with a bus or mobile unit set up for folks to give blood convert over to blood level testing 
and go into neighborhoods that have low testing rates? 

■ A public health friend of mine said that Genesee County Health workers are stressed to the 

max. Can we deploy appropriate personnel from other county health agencies to help with 
inspecting homes for possible other causes? In other words, it won’t do any good to invest more 
in water infrastructure if we’re finding window sills with teeth marks. I say this NOT to 
downplay the role that water lead levels may have played. But can we get Habitat for Humanity, 
for example, to do a massive volunteer effort to eradicate lead paint in homes ... or is that 
beyond their expertise? 

■ Gather experts to assess exactly how extensive the problem is and potential causes. And then 

convey this in a much more accessible ways. If you want blood level data, you have to scroll 
down on the DHHS web site, find the headline and then read a long press release. Maybe we’re 
conveying this information better on the ground, but if not, we need to communicate conclusive 
findings in multiple ways- graphics, video, informational photo galleries and maybe even a 
“test” that residents can take to see if their home is at risk in other ways. I know that sounds 
awfully MLive-ish, but it can be effective.

Team: 


Today Harvey and I met with the Flint Water Task Force. It was a good meeting. People were 
pleased with the G’s statement from the prior day. Captain Kelenske joined us and we had a 
very good discussion about moving forward with the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency 
Coordinating Committee (FIACC). Tim Becker and Captain Kelenske provided me with a fair 
amount of input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for a State of Emergency 
which Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I have distilled all 
of this into a two page plan that I want your edits and comments on and a one page 
organizational chart (now presented in the “governor’s colors” according to our fine people in 
Communications). Spoiler alert — I made Captain Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole shebang 
(with the Colonel’s blessing) so Harvey wouldn’t get lonely. 


Here is my ask of you: 


1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the Governor either 
New Year’s Day or Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday (Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the meeting January 7 
along with financial resources that we still need some estimates on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change the narrative 
focus on Monday’s Genesee County declaration of emergency 

I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge period but I do 
appreciate everyone’s efforts and I know the Boss really does as well. 


Regards, 


Rich

My framework on this is very disaster/emergency centric where we have a problem and do our best to quickly 
get it fixed ... I know this has a lot more political issues ! am not as schooled in though.

I offer a few thoughts, and some of these may be incredibly naive, but we seem to be in a brainstorming mode: 


■ Should we include MSHDA in the mix of departments involved in this? They administer the Community 

Development Block Grant program and this may call for some of that money. 

■ It might be prudent to reach out to Sen. Ananich, Rep. Neeley and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee to see if they would like 

representatives from their offices on any of these committees. 

■ We still need to convey better the extent of the problem. So maybe this is a communications issue more than 

anything else, because I do know testing is going on. I don’t know HOW it’s going on, so I offer these 
suggestions, realizing they may already be happening or are totally unrealistic: 

The goal: Assess the extent of the elevated blood lead levels - the number of those affected and the degree to 
which they’re affected 

■ Get as many people in the affected zip codes tested as possible - can the Red Cross or some other agency with a 

bus or mobile unit set up for folks to give blood convert over to blood level testing and go into neighborhoods 
that have low testing rates? 

■ A public health friend of mine said that Genesee County Health workers are stressed to the max. Can we deploy 

appropriate personnel from other county health agencies to help with inspecting homes for possible other 
causes? In other words, it won’t do any good to invest more in water infrastructure if we’re finding window sills 
with teeth marks. I say this NOT to downplay the role that water lead levels may have played. But can we get 
Habitat for Humanity, for example, to do a massive volunteer effort to eradicate lead paint in homes ... or is 
that beyond their expertise? 

■ Gather experts to assess exactly how extensive the problem is and potential causes. And then convey this in a 

much more accessible ways. If you want blood level data, you have to scroll down on the DHHS web site, find 
the headline and then read a long press release. Maybe we’re conveying this information better on the ground, 
but if not, we need to communicate conclusive findings in multiple ways- graphics, video, informational photo 
galleries and maybe even a “test” that residents can take to see if their home is at risk in other ways. I know that 
sounds awfully MLive-ish, but it can be effective.

Today Harvey and I met with the Flint Water Task Force. It was a good meeting. People were pleased with the 
G’s statement from the prior day. Captain Kelenske joined us and we had a very good discussion about moving 
forward with the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency Coordinating Committee (FIACC). Tim Becker and 
Captain Kelenske provided me with a fair amount of input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for 
a State of Emergency which Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I have 
distilled all of this into a two page plan that I want your edits and comments on and a one page organizational 
chart (now presented in the “governor’s colors” according to our fine people in Communications). Spoiler 
alert — I made Captain Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole shebang (with the Colonel’s blessing) so Harvey 
wouldn’t get lonely. 


Here is my ask of you: 


1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the Governor either New Year’s Day 
or Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday (Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the meeting January 7 along with 
financial resources that we still need some estimates on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change the narrative focus on 
Monday’s Genesee County declaration of emergency 

I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge period but I do appreciate 
everyone’s efforts and I know the Boss really does as well. 


Regards, 


Rich

ADOPTED: 




RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY FROM 
KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

It is in the long term best interests of the City of Flint to enter into a contract with the 
KWA to purchase up to eighteen (1 8) units of capacity. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase up to eighteen ( 18 ) units of capacity. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, vvitli approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at tire Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25 

[http://w%vTv.mlive,com/ne\vs/flint/index,ssf/20i3/o3/flint_citj r _council_again_delay.litml] , may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it 
to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and wilt be treated in Flint, 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint 
River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River 
Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Fiint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing w'ater 
from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a count}' water and waste advisory board. The 
KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasuiy officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined 
the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years 

[http://www.nilive.coin/news/fllnt/index, ssf/20i3/o3/flint_city_council_delays_deci.html] by getting water from the 
KWA. 

"It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because 
there will be increased treatment cost for the river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water 
plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times 
per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still ... Page 2 of 2 


“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials 
said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

What: Jeff Wright Statement on Flint City Council Approving Resolution to Join KWA. 
When: March 26, 2013 


Additional Info: Jeff Wright, CEO of the KWA, today praised the Flint City Council for voting to approve 
a resolution to officially have the City of Flint join the KWA and its' water line, 

"I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint's City Council and Mayor," said 
Wright. "I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the 
residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials." The next step in the 
process will come with the KWA Board executing the contract for the City. 

"The most important aspect from the vote is the fact that we as an Authority can move forward 
knowing Flint's intentions," said Wright. 

Despite Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz publicly supporting the project, Wright had made a vote by 
council a condition of Flint joining the KWA so the residents would have their say. 

"There is a basic tenet that government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the council 
vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, 
should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside of their community," said Wright. 

At the next Water and Waste Advisory Board meeting a vote will be taken to award a contract for 
construction of the intake portion of the water line. All bids were submitted to the board at their last 
meeting for review.

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY

ANDY DILLON 
STATE TREASURER 


Mr. Edward Kurtz April 11,2013 

Emergency Manager 
City of Flint 

1 101 South Saginaw Street 
Flint, MI 48502 

Dear Mr. Kurtz: 

Thank you for your March 29, 2013 letter, which is attached for reference. As the Emergency 
Manager for the City of Flint (“Flint” or “City”), you have asked for my concurrence, pursuant to 
Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, to authorize a contract in 
excess of $50,000.00 not subject to competitive bidding. This request was related to the City 
entering into an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) for provision of raw 
water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 1 5, 2013. As such, this approval 
will be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012, 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA.

FLINT, MI — Flint residents may soon get their water from Lake Huron. 


The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


"This is about compromise," said Councilman Sheldon Neeley. 


Neeley got support from Councilman Joshua Freeman, after the two were previously at odds about the amount the city should withdraw 
from Lake Huron. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone "no" vote. 


"It was a protest vote," Nolden said. "I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner said construction of the pipeline could start in May. 

The city currently pays to get its water from Detroit. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved.

Re: Increase in average day and maximum peak day by GCDC 

Dear Mr. Wolfson: 

The Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s Office, Division of Water and Waste Services 
(“GCDC”) has been working diligently to fulfill the demands of the various state and federal agencies, 
Governor Snyder, and the people of the City of Flint (“Flint”), to provide Flint with water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (“DWSD”). These efforts include placing approximately seven 
(7) miles of the seventy-two inch (72”) water transmission pipeline (“Pipeline”) that GCDC purchased 
from Flint back into service, pressurizing the Pipeline, disinfecting the Pipeline, flushing the Pipeline, and 
performing Bac-T testing on the water inside of the Pipeline. Once these efforts have materialized and 
GCDC has received two (2) negative Bac-T tests, GCDC will be in a tactical position to furnish DWSD 
water to Flint as early as midweek. 

On October 8, 2015, I sent you a letter after GCDC received a formal request from Flint for 
GCDC to provide DWSD water to Flint pursuant to a previous written agreement between GCDC and 
Flint. As of today, I have not received your response. In the October 8, 2015, letter I requested the 
following: 

GCDC has received a formal request from Flint to receive DWSD water via GCDC per 
GCDC’s contract with Flint. GCDC’s rates are currently based on 12 mgd average day 
and 25 mgd maximum peak day. Does DWSD have the capacity to increase demand to 
GCDC to 28.5 mgd average day and 51 mgd peak day? If so, could you please provide 
GCDC with the rates for 28.5 mgd average and 51 mgd peak day through June 30, 2016? 

Attorney Anthony Chubb from Flint has provided me with a proposed WATER SERVICE 
CONTRACT BETWEEN CITY OF DETROIT AND CITY OF FLINT (“Contract”). Dus Contract 
makes the assumption that Flint has a separate connection to the DWSD water distribution system. The 
interconnect between the DWSD water system and the Flint water system is owned by GCDC. Flint does 
not have a separate connection to the DWSD water distribution system. Any water that Flint receives

McGraw Morris P.C, 


Mr. Wolfson

from DWSD is required to flow through GN-01. Additionally, GCDC has received no communication 
from DWSD on this subject since the Flint water issue surfaced. Simply stated, DWSD has the ability to 
service Flint with water only through the interconnect owned by GCDC. 

GCDC is working diligently to move forward with Flint receiving DWSD water; however, 
GCDC cannot do anything until it has an agreement with DWSD and Flint as to how the DWSD water 
will be transmitted to Flint. Right now, Flint is requesting GCDC to provide DWSD water GN-01 
pursuant to the written agreement between GCDC and Flint. Additionally, Flint has also request DWSD 
to provide Flint with water with the understanding that DWSD has no way to transmit the water to Flint. 
There is no question that Flint wants and eventually will be serviced with DWSD water; however, DWSD 
and Flint cannot continually ignore the fact that GCDC owns and operates the interconnect between 
DWSD and Flint. 

GCDC has been working diligently to assist Flint in receiving DWSD water; however, DWSD to 
date has been unwilling to provide GCDC the information it needs so that Flint may switch over the 
DWSD water. When you have prepared your response, please send it to kkilby@mcgrawmorris.com or 
contact Director John O’Brien at 810-732-7870.

Subject: state money for detroit water 

Sara: 

I was at a City Council meeting last night when Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson said the state has only wired 
Flint $2 million of the $6 million approved by the state Legislature. 

She said the city has been told it will receive an additional $2 million in January and another $2 million in April. 
Henderson said she's asked that the money be sent immediately because the city was required to pay Detroit the entire 
$12 million upfront, before the water was reconnected, and its water and sewer fund balance has dropped significantly 
as a result. 

Several council members also spoke about this, and Council President Josh Freeman called the payment plant "beyond 
ridiculous" given the city's financial position. 

Is there someone who can talk to us about this?

Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


City of Flint Drinking Water 
Outline prepared by the 

Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for the 
Flint Water Task Force 


I. INTRODUCTION 

This document is intended to provide an overview of Michigan’s implementation of 
the Safe Drinking Water Act, 1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399), with respect to 
events in the city of Flint (City), Michigan. 

II. BACKGROUND 

1 . How has Flint historically obtained its drinking water? 

The water system in the City was organized and built under private ownership in 
1 883 as the Flint Water Works Company to pump raw water from the Flint River to 
their consumers. In 1903, the system was converted to a municipally-owned 
corporation which supplied drinking water to the City. In 1 967, the City became a 
customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) system. 

After the switch to DWSD, the City operated its water treatment plant as a standby 
plant for purposes of reliability in the event of an emergency, such as an interruption 
in service of the single pipeline from DWSD. In the last ten years, the water 
treatment plant was used as an emergency backup during two weeks in 2009: 

June 18 through June 20 and September 10 through September 13. 

As a backup emergency water treatment plant, the City was required to operate the 
water treatment plant quarterly to demonstrate the capability to produce drinking 
water in accordance with Act 399 and to keep mechanical equipment (such as 
valves, rubber seals, etc.) in good working order. Each quarter, the water treatment 
plant was test run and samples were taken of both raw water and finished water 
(post-filters). Since the water treatment plant was upgraded in the early 2000s, 
monitoring showed that the water treatment plant was performing as designed. 

Contractual obligations with DWSD did not allow treated water to be put into the 
City’s distribution system during these test runs. Treated water was discharged to 
the Flint River in accordance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 
(NPDES) Permit. The test runs were for demonstration purposes, to keep the water 
treatment plant operational, and staff familiar with operation in the event it was 
needed in an emergency. 

2. What State and Federal laws or rules exist to ensure safe drinking water is 
provided to City residents? 

The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (federal SDWA) is the primary law that ensures 
the quality of Americans' drinking water. Under the federal SDWA, the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) sets standards for drinking water quality 
and oversees the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those 
standards. 


1 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


The federal SDWA was originally passed by Congress in 1974 to protect public 
health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. The law was amended 
in 1986 and 1996 and requires many actions to protect drinking water and its 
sources: rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and ground water wells. (The federal 
SDWA does not regulate private wells which serve fewer than 25 individuals.) 

Originally, the federal SDWA focused primarily on treatment as the means of 
providing safe drinking water at the tap. The 1 996 amendments greatly enhanced 
the existing law by recognizing source water protection, operator training, funding for 
water system improvements, and public information as important components of safe 
drinking water. This approach ensures the quality of drinking water by protecting it 
from source to tap. 

The most direct oversight of water systems is conducted by state drinking water 
programs. States can apply to the USEPA for “primacy,” - the authority to implement 
the federal SDWA within their jurisdictions - if they will adopt standards at least as 
stringent as the USEPA’s and enforce those standards. Michigan adopted the Safe 
Drinking Water Act in 1976 through Act 399 and has maintained primacy for the 
program since that time. 

3. What is the USEPA’s role as a regulatory agency in implementing the SDWA? 

Federal and state governments share responsibility for administering drinking water 
programs. Under the federal SDWA, the USEPA is given the responsibility for 
developing national standards and regulations that apply to the nation’s public 
drinking water systems and enforcing those standards, by working with states. 

Michigan’s drinking water program is evaluated annually by the USEPA for 
compliance with the federal SDWA. Based upon these evaluations, the USEPA 
continues to find Michigan’s drinking water program to be compliant with the federal 
SDWA. 

4. What is the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s (DEQ) role as a 
regulatory agency in implementing the SDWA? 

The federal SDWA permits states to accept oversight of the drinking water program 
under an agreement with the USEPA giving states primary enforcement 
responsibilities (or primacy). In addition to this delegation of federal authority to the 
states, states also have the power to create additional regulations and programs 
governing drinking water suppliers through their own legislative and regulatory 
processes. Michigan has had regulatory authority of public water supplies since 
1913 (Waterworks and Sewerage Systems, 1913 PA 98). 

The DEQ has been granted primary enforcement authority in Michigan for the federal 
SDWA under the authority of Act 399. As such, the DEQ, Office of Drinking Water 
and Municipal Assistance, has regulatory oversight for all public water supplies, 
including approximately 1,400 community water supplies and 10,000 noncommunity 
water supplies. A community water supply provides year-round service to 15 or 
more living units (homes, apartments, dorm rooms, etc.) or 25 or more residents. A 
noncommunity water supply has 15 or more service connections or serves 25 or 
more individuals on an average daily basis for not less than 60 days per year.

The DEQ engages in a variety of activities to help water systems remain in, or return 
to, compliance. These activities include: conducting surveillance visits (inspections) 
at water systems and reviewing facilities, equipment, and operations; requiring the 
submission of plans and specifications for waterworks system improvements and 
issuing construction permits; providing for the training, examination, certification and 
regulation of persons operating water supplies; helping systems incorporate 
preventive measures; and since 1996, providing financial assistance for system 
improvements. 

5. What is the City’s role in implementing the federal SDWA and Act 399? 

State and federal programs develop regulations and perform oversight and 
compliance activities, but do not treat or deliver water to customers. At the local 
level, public and private water utilities collect, treat, and deliver drinking water to 
consumers in compliance with state and federal regulations. 

The federal SDWA and Act 399 set up multiple barriers against contamination. 
These barriers include: source water protection, multiple treatment components, 
distribution system integrity, proper operations oversight, and public information. As 
the owner of a public water system, the City is responsible for knowing and following 
all requirements under Act 399, such as ensuring proper design, construction, 
operations and maintenance, so that contaminants in tap water do not exceed the 
standards established by law. The City treats the water, and must test its water 
routinely for specified contaminants and report the results to the DEQ. If a water 
system is not meeting these standards, it is the water supplier’s responsibility to 
notify its customers. 

The federal SDWA and Act 399 recognize that customers have the right to know 
what is in their drinking water and where it comes from. The City, like all water 
suppliers, must notify consumers when there is a problem with water quality. 

The City submits samples of its water for laboratory testing (monitoring) to verify the 
water it provides to residents meets all federal and state standards. How often and 
where samples are taken varies from system to system and from contaminant to 
contaminant. The DEQ provides an annual monitoring schedule to the City setting 
forth these requirements. 

In addition, the City is required to employ properly certified water operators that are 
trained and experienced to operate the treatment and distribution systems 
associated with the City’s water system. 

6. What approvals were needed from the DEQ in order for the City to begin using 
its water treatment plant full time? 

The City had long ago been issued construction permits for raw water pumps to 
withdraw water from the Flint River and the City was grandfathered under the water 
withdrawal program (Part 327, Great Lakes Preservation, of the Natural Resources 
and Environmental Protection Act, 1 994 PA 451 , as amended), as were all existing 
community public water systems at that time. There were no additional DEQ 


3 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


permissions or authorizations required under Act 399 because the City already had 
approval to use the water treatment plant. 

Under Act 399, there are no licenses or permits required to operate public water 
systems. The City did apply for and obtained two construction permits prior to the 
water treatment plant changing from an emergency backup plant to full-time 
operation. These permits were for new chemical feed equipment, changes to the 
electrical service, etc. 

III. THE FLINT RIVER - IS IT A SAFE SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER? 


Seventy-five percent of Michigan’s population served by a public water supply 
receive their drinking water from surface water sources, the majority of which is 
withdrawn from the Great Lakes. However, several public water supplies in Michigan 
utilize water from inland rivers. All surface water sources require significant 
treatment in order to be safe for consumption. 

While all surface water sources must receive a high level of treatment, inland river 
sources present a greater challenge than water withdrawn from one of the Great 
Lakes because of rapidly changing water quality conditions. Under most 
circumstances, rivers are prone to greater fluctuations in temperature, have higher 
amounts of organic material, greater turbidity (suspended solids), and are more 
vulnerable to microbiological and viral contamination than Lakes Huron, Erie, 
Michigan or Superior. While the water chemistry in the Flint River differs from that in 
Lake Huron, it can still be treated in accordance with the federal SDWA and Act 399. 
The waterworks industry has the technology to treat wide ranging source waters to 
provide potable and palatable drinking water, including direct reuse of treated 
wastewater. Regardless of source water quality, all public water systems must 
comply with the same drinking water standards in the finished water. 


It is not the source water that reacts with the homeowners plumbing in the 
distribution system, but rather the finished water quality that is important. Treated 
water leaving the City’s water treatment plant does not contain lead. In addition, the 
treatment process employed by the City includes lime softening to reduce the 
hardness in the river water. The City includes lime softening and pH adjustment 
primarily to improve aesthetic water quality associated with hardness. Lime 
softening is not a process that water supply professionals would expect to increase 
corrosivity of water. The City, however, does practice recarbonation to readjust pH 
at the end of the softening process. 

pH levels of finished water leaving the City’s water treatment plant averaged 7.7. 
Expanded water monitoring conducted quarterly at 25 sample sites located 
throughout the distribution system showed the following: 


July - September 2014 
October - December 201 4 
January - March 2015 
April - June 2015 


average pH = 7.71 
average pH = 7.88 
average pH = 7.81 
average pH = 7.63 


range: 7.56-7.86 
range: 7.62-8.10 
range: 7.60-7.99 
range: 7.48-7.80

The data below was obtained at ten of the sampling locations throughout the City’s 
distribution system, while they were still purchasing water from DWSD before the 
City switched to the Flint River as a source: 

January - March 2014 (DWSD) average pH = 7.47 range: 7.40 - 7.54 

April 2014 (DWSD) average pH = 7.49 range: 7.42 - 7.59 

Note that the pH of the treated water produced while the City was using the Flint 
River did not differ significantly from pH values seen in the distribution system during 
the time the City purchased water from DWSD. Thus, pH monitoring provided no 
indication of a change in water corrosivity. 

IV. E. COLI AND TOTAL COLIFORM BACTERIA VIOLATIONS 

1 . What caused the E. coli and total coliform bacteria violations experienced by 
the City in August and September 2014? 

A number of factors, primarily related to distribution system operation and 
maintenance, likely contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the City during August 
and September 2014 triggered by exceedances of bacteria standards in limited 
areas of the distribution system. In addition, the coliform detections were confined to 
less than 20 percent of the water system. Had the detections been the result of a 
failure in treatment, detections would have been expected throughout the City rather 
than in such a limited geographic area. 

Instead, the violations seem to have been caused by other factors such as aging 
infrastructure. The City’s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of 
infrastructure investment and asset management. Most of the City’s over 550 miles 
of water mains are now over 75 years old, and constructed of unlined cast iron 
piping. This cast iron pipe is subject to tuberculation, which thins and weakens the 
pipe walls in some areas and causes a buildup of sediment and debris on the pipe 
walls in other areas. Tuberculation can lead to water quality issues as well as 
reduced flows and pressures. Tuberculation also encourages the development of 
biofilms. Biofilm growth may occur more frequently in areas where little or no 
disinfectant is maintained. 

The City has also experienced decades of a declining customer base and water use, 
with vacant homes, commercial businesses, and industrial property. Declining water 
use leads to excess residence time (water age) within the City’s distribution pipes 
and water storage facilities, accelerating tuberculation, biofilm growth, and reductions 
of disinfectant concentration in the distribution system. While the City has recently 
seen an infusion of funding for blight removal, contractors using fire hydrants to 
complete this work have been known to cause hydraulic disturbances that dislodge 
and suspend settled debris, which may contribute to the bacterial contamination. 
These hydraulic disturbances were also believed to be a source of the aesthetic 
water quality complaints both the City and the DEQ were receiving. 

The winter of 2013-2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water 
system. The City, which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 
30 percent, saw even greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold 
weather-related water main breaks and leaks (City personnel reported 400 water 


5 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


main breaks in calendar year 2014, with greater than 50 percent in the winter 
quarter). The City has also been lacking a formal maintenance program for its more 
than 7,250 valves, which are critical in limiting the areas impacted during water main 
repairs. As an example, two valves on the transmission line used to supply the area 
of the 2014 Boil Water Advisories were found to be closed during the City’s 
investigation of possible sources, causing much longer residence times, reduced 
disinfectant concentrations, and reduced pressures - all potential avenues for 
contamination to enter a distribution system. 

The Boil Water Advisories also occurred during the warmest and relatively wet 
periods of August and September 2014. Warm weather conditions are not only more 
conducive to bacterial growth but also degrade disinfectant concentrations more 
quickly. As already explained, longer residence times, biofilms, and tuberculation 
contribute to lowered disinfectant concentrations. Warm, wet weather conditions 
also allow water contaminated with bacteria to accumulate or pond around piping 
that leaks and breaks. 

During the summer of 2014, the City was actively repairing the distribution system 
(City personnel reported 29 water main breaks in June through August 2014). After 
the switch to the Flint River, it was discovered that there were many broken or closed 
valves in the distribution system (City personnel reported 120 broken valves and 
239 valves in an improper position). As the City began correcting these problems, 
they did detect the presence of coliform organisms in the distribution system in 
testing conducted as a result of the repairs. This sporadic detection is not an 
unusual occurrence. Many communities have experienced similar issues when 
significant repairs are made in the system and/or they suffer water main breaks and 
localized pressure losses. 

2. How were the violations detected? What was the DEQ’s response? 

Federal SDWA regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water 
distribution systems are incorporated into Act 399. There are a variety of bacteria, 
parasites, and viruses which can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest 
them in drinking water. Testing water for each of these potential pathogens would be 
difficult and expensive. Instead, community water systems are required to test 
monthly for total coliform and E. coli. Total coliform bacteria, while not pathogenic, 
often originate from the same sources as many pathogens. Therefore, the presence 
of total coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or 
other contaminants to enter the system. The absence of total conforms in the 
distribution system indicates a minimal likelihood that pathogens are present. E. coli 
is itself a pathogen and its detection is considered direct evidence of a health risk. 

The Boil Water Advisories which occurred in the City were associated with bacteria 
monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards. These advisories were 
issued by the City after consultation with the DEQ. 

Upon receiving information indicating total coliform and E. coli bacteria had been 
detected, the DEQ advised the City to issue a Boil Water Advisory from August 15 
through 20, 2014, for the affected portion of the City. Another Boil Water Advisory 
was issued from September 5 through 9, 2014, due to localized detections of total 


6 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


coliform bacteria in the same and adjacent portions of the City. The advisories 
covered an area of less than 20 percent of the water department’s service area. 

Once a Boil Water Advisory has been issued, time is needed to investigate potential 
causes and implement corrective measures. The larger the water system, the more 
time this may take. Once corrective measures have been taken, samples must be 
collected and analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present. Under 
approved analytical methods used by the City, samples must be incubated for 24 
hours before results can be obtained. In situations where the bacterial contamination 
has been confirmed, two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 
hours apart are normally obtained before canceling a Boil Water Advisory. Adding 
each of these steps together, a normal response period to rescind a Boil Water 
Advisory under these circumstances would be expected to take 3 to 4 days. 

V. TOTAL TRIHALOMETHANES (TTHM) VIOLATIONS 

1 . What caused the TTHM violations experienced by the City beginning in late 
summer 2014? 

Disinfectants are an essential element of drinking water treatment because of the 
barrier they provide against waterborne disease-causing microorganisms. However, 
disinfection byproducts form when disinfectants used to treat drinking water react 
with naturally occurring organic materials in the water (e.g., decomposing plant 
material). The formation of disinfection byproducts continues to occur as water 
travels throughout water distribution systems. 

A major challenge for water suppliers is how to provide protection from pathogens 
while simultaneously minimizing health risks to the population from disinfection 
byproducts. Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM - chloroform, bromoform, 
bromodichloromethane, and dibromochloromethane) and halogenated acetic acids 
(HAA5 - monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo-, dibromo-) are widely 
occurring classes of disinfection byproducts. The amount of TTHM and HAA5 in 
drinking water can change depending on the season, water temperature, amount of 
chlorine added, the amount of plant material in the water, and a variety of other 
factors. All community water systems that chemically disinfect or purchase water 
that has been chemically disinfected are required to monitor for disinfection 
byproducts. 

The Flint River has higher levels of organic material than water in the Great Lakes 
and as a result, the water produced by the City developed higher disinfection 
byproducts than the water purchased from DWSD. Because the water treatment 
plant was previously operating intermittently, it was not possible to predict 
disinfection byproduct levels at distribution system compliance points until the City 
began relying on its water treatment plant continuously. 

As mentioned previously, the City became aware that there were numerous broken 
valves and closed valves that should have been open in the distribution system. At 
that time, the City also began a mapping effort to identify “water age” in the 
distribution system. The longer the residence time or “water age” the greater the 
opportunity for the formation of disinfection byproducts.

November 16, 2015 


2. How were the violations detected? What was the DEQ’s response? 

Disinfection byproducts are monitored at eight sites throughout the distribution 
system. A locational running annual average is calculated for each individual site. 
Because TTHM and HAA5 maximum contaminant levels are calculated based on a 
running annual average at specific distribution system locations, the actual violation 
of the standard did not occur until the fall of 2014. However, because it was 
apparent in the summer of 2014 that the standard would eventually be exceeded; the 
DEQ asked the City to proactively implement measures to address the problem 
before the violation required them to do so. 

As a result of maintenance efforts undertaken by the City to repair valves and correct 
improperly closed valves, the City was able to improve water flow in the distribution 
system and thereby reduce residence time or “water age” in the system. Operational 
changes made to reduce the amount of storage in the system also helped reduce 
residence time which contributed to a reduction in disinfection byproduct formation. 

In addition to operational changes to minimize residence time in the distribution 
system, the City added granular activated carbon to its filters in July 2015. Levels of 
TTHMs and HAA5s were reduced and the City returned to compliance on 
September 1, 2015. 

VI. THE TASTE, ODOR, AND COLOR COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY FLINT 

1 . What caused the taste, odor, and color complaints received by the City from 
residents? 

Taste, odor, and color issues are very personalized. While water leaving the water 
treatment plant did not have any unusual taste, odor or color; during the summer 
after the switch to the Flint River, customer complaints increased. Construction in 
the distribution system, hydrant flushing, and changes in flow characteristics are all 
known causes of disturbances within the distribution system that can cause an 
increase in taste, odor, and color complaints. Aesthetics, such as taste, odor, and 
color, while a concern, by themselves are not a threat to public health. 

2. What was the DEQ’s response? 

The DEQ consulted with the City regarding these complaints. The City indicated that 
they were offering to investigate such complaints for anyone that had issues; but City 
personnel informed the DEQ that they were not able to recreate these situations in 
the field. In addition, as a result of the repair work that was underway and the 
increased flushing to reduce water age in the system to help control TTHMs, it was 
anticipated that there would be short-term disturbances in the system that would 
cause color and odor complaints. All water supplies are advised to provide notice to 
residents prior to undertaking a flushing program because flushing (even routine 
flushing) often causes temporary problems as described. Based on information from 
City personnel, it appeared that the complaints were related to such operational 
activities occurring in the distribution system.

VII. LEAD ISSUES IN THE FLINT DRINKING WATER 

1 . What causes lead in drinking water? 

Lead is rarely found in source water. Lead enters tap water through corrosion of 
plumbing materials. Homes built before 1986 are more likely to have lead fixtures 
and solder. Older homes built prior to World War II are more likely to contain lead 
pipes. The most common problem with newer construction is with brass or chrome- 
plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach significant amounts of lead into the 
water, especially hot water. The amount of lead in tap water also depends on the 
types and amounts of minerals in the water, how long the water stays in the pipes, 
the amount of wear in the pipes, the pH of the water, and its temperature. 

2. What is the Lead and Copper Rule? 

On June 7, 1991, the USEPA published a regulation to control lead and copper in 
drinking water. This regulation is known as the Lead and Copper Rule (also referred 
to as the LCR). The treatment technique for the rule requires systems to monitor 
drinking water at customer taps. If the 90th percentile for lead exceeds an action 
level of 15 parts per billion (ppb) or the 90th percentile for copper exceeds an action 
level of 1 .3 parts per million (ppm), the system must undertake a number of 
additional actions to control corrosion. If the action level for lead is exceeded, the 
water supply must also inform the public about steps they should take to protect their 
health and the water supply may have to replace lead service lines under their 
control. 

3. What is the lead action level? 

For most contaminants, the USEPA sets an enforceable regulation called a 
maximum contaminant level based on the maximum contaminant level goal. 
Maximum contaminant levels are set as close to the maximum contaminant level 
goals as possible, considering cost, benefits, and the ability of public water systems 
to detect and remove contaminants at the water treatment plant using suitable 
treatment technologies. Because lead contamination of drinking water often results 
from corrosion of the plumbing materials belonging to water system customers, the 
USEPA established a treatment technique rather than a maximum contaminant level 
for lead. A treatment technique is an enforceable procedure or level of technological 
performance which water systems must follow to control a contaminant. Although 
the maximum contaminant level goal for lead is zero, based upon the above factors, 
the USEPA has established the action level for lead at 15 ppb. 

The treatment technique regulation for lead requires water systems that produce 
drinking water to control the corrosivity of the water. The regulation also requires 
systems to collect customer tap samples from sites served by the system that are 
more likely to have plumbing materials containing lead. If the 90th percentile action 
level for lead is exceeded, then water systems are required to take additional actions 
including: 

• Optimizing corrosion control treatment (for water systems serving greater than 
50,000 people that have not fully optimized corrosion control). 


9 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


• Educating the public about lead in drinking water and actions consumers can 
take to reduce their exposure to lead. 

• Replacing the portions of lead service lines (lines that connect distribution 
mains to customers) under the water system’s control. 

4. Did DWSD have optimized corrosion control treatment? 

After the LCR passed in 1991 , DWSD and all of its consecutive customer systems 
conducted two rounds of monitoring for lead and copper. Copper levels were well 
below action level limits, but lead levels exceeded the action level of 15 ppb for 
DWSD and many of its customer communities. As a result, DWSD installed 
corrosion control treatment. DWSD performed a corrosion control study and 
concluded that they could reduce the corrosivity of the water by the addition of an 
orthophosphate, a corrosion inhibitor. 

5. Did the DEQ require the City to have corrosion control in place when it 
switched to the Flint River as its source of drinking water? 

No. There are two ways under the LCR to deem a water supply as providing 
“optimal corrosion control” - either by sampling and determining through a 
calculation that the supply is “optimal” or by installing treatment if it is needed. The 
DEQ requested that the City perform two 6-month rounds of monitoring to 
demonstrate if the City was practicing optimal corrosion control treatment. According 
to state regulations [R325. 1 0604f(2)(b)(iii)], a system can demonstrate optimized 
corrosion controls by sampling in two, consecutive 6-month monitoring periods and 
comparing the results of this monitoring to the lead level in the source. Optimal 
corrosion control under this scenario would be defined as having the 90th percentile 
in each of these monitoring periods lower than the sum of the lead in the source and 
the practical quantification limit for lead of 5 ppb. Since the source water has 0 ppb 
lead, the City would have been deemed optimal if its 90th percentile of lead was 
5 ppb or less in these two consecutive periods. However, once a system has 
installed treatment, it would also be considered optimized regardless of the 90th 
percentile level achieved, as long as it does not exceed the action level of 15 ppb. 

In this case, the City had been purchasing water from DWSD that was treated for 
corrosion control. It was the DWSD water system that was considered as having 
optimized corrosion control at that point. Since the City water system had not been 
the supplier of water before, the DEQ did not require the City to maintain corrosion 
control for which it was not responsible [R325.1 0604f(2)(b)]. It could not “maintain” 
operations undertaken elsewhere by a different entity for a different source of water. 
The DEQ’s instructions to the City were consistent with past practices afforded to all 
other large water systems. At the beginning of the LCR, all large systems were 
initially granted the option to demonstrate optimal corrosion control treatment through 
full-scale monitoring under the applicable rules. For these reasons, two 6-month 
rounds of monitoring, as required by the LCR, were the required means to determine 
whether or not optimal corrosion control was being achieved. 

6. How does the DEQ calculate the 90th percentile? 

To determine the 90th percentile of a list of lead or copper results, the procedure 
below is followed: 


10 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


Step 1 : Place lead or copper results in ascending order 
Step 2: Assign each sample a number, 1 for lowest value 
Step 3: Multiply the total number of samples by 0.9 - this yields the 90th percentile 
sample. For example: 20 samples x 0.9 = 18th sample. This is the 90th 
percentile level. 

Calculating the 90th percentile is easiest when a supply collects 1 0 samples (or a 
multiple of 1 0). Note that the 90th percentile must be interpolated if the number of 
samples is not a multiple of 10. 

7. What was the result of the first round of monitoring conducted by the City? 

The first 6-month round of lead and copper monitoring conducted by the City ended 
on December 31 , 2014. One hundred samples were submitted and the 90th 
percentile lead level was calculated to be 6 ppb. The next step required by the DEQ 
was for the City to collect a second round of monitoring. 

8. What was the result of the second round of monitoring conducted by the City? 

The second 6-month round of lead and copper monitoring conducted by the City 
ended on June 30, 2015. Sixty-nine samples that complied with the site selection 
criteria were submitted and the 90th percentile lead level was calculated to be 
1 1 ppb. The conclusion from these results was that the City, while in compliance 
with the action level, exceeded the level required to be deemed as having optimized 
corrosion control. 

9. Why was the City required to collect 1 00 compliance samples for lead and 
copper in the first 6-month monitoring period of July through December of 
2014 and then only 60 compliance samples in the second 6-month period of 
January through June of 2015? 

The number of compliance samples required for lead and copper is based upon the 
population served by the water system as identified in the table below, taken from 
Rule 325.10710a of Act 399.

The number of samples the City was required to collect in the first round of 
monitoring after they began relying on the Flint River was based on the 2010 census, 
which listed the City’s population as more than 100,000 residents. In March of 2015, 
the City provided updated information that indicated the City’s population had 
decreased to less than 100,000. Therefore, they were only required to collect 60 
samples. There is no rule prohibiting the collection of additional compliance samples 
- only establishing a minimum number necessary.

November 16, 2015 


10. What actions did the DEQ order the City to undertake after the second round of 
monitoring? 

While the City’s LCR compliance monitoring continued to meet action level 
requirements, the City exceeded the level required to be deemed as having 
optimized corrosion control. Following receipt of the City’s compliance monitoring 
results, the DEQ sent a letter on August 17, 2015, requiring the City to install 
corrosion control treatment. 

Under the LCR, the City has 6 months to let the DEQ know whether it intends to 
conduct a study, then 18 months to perform the study and make its recommendation, 
and 24 months to complete installation of the selected corrosion control. The DEQ 
requested the City accelerate this schedule. The City submitted plans and 
specifications to install corrosion control treatment and a construction permit was 
issued by the DEQ on October 28, 2015. The City is in the process of installing the 
necessary equipment and procuring the appropriate chemicals. Treatment is 
expected to be on-line by the end of November 201 5. As of October 1 6, 2015, the 
City resumed purchasing water from DWSD that is already optimized and provides a 
corrosion inhibitor. The additional treatment by the City will further enhance the 
amount of inhibitor in the system. 

11. What had Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) advised 
the DEQ regarding blood lead levels prior to the DEQ ordering the City to 
implement optimized corrosion control? 

In an e-mail dated July 28, 2015, regarding blood lead testing, the 
Michigan DHHS indicated that they: 

“...compared lead testing rates and lead testing results to the 
same time frame for the previous 3 years, to see if there were 
any patterns that suggested that there were increased rates of 
lead poisoning after the water supply was switched. Per the 
attached charts - 

• Lead testing rates remained about the same from 
year-to-year...

• However, that pattern was not terribly different from what we 
saw in the previous three years; especially in 2011-2012 (we are 
working with our Epidemiologist to statistically verify any 
significant differences). 

• We commonly see a ‘seasonal effect’ with lead, related to 
people opening and closing windows more often in the summer, 
which disturbs old deteriorating paint on the windows, sills and

from the deteriorating paint to other parts of the room/house. We

contributing to elevated blood lead tests, we expected that the 
increased rates would extend beyond the summer, but they drop 
quite a bit from September to October, stayed low over the 
winter, and are just starting to tail up again in the spring of 2015.” 

This e-mail from DHHS in concert with the completion of two 6-month rounds of lead 
compliance sampling data indicating that the City had not exceeded an action level 
for lead provided the basis for the DEQ to maintain that the water in the City 
continued to be in compliance with the federal SDWA and Act 399. 

12. When did the DEQ first become aware of allegations of elevated blood levels 
being detected in certain children? 

The DEQ was notified on August 23, 2015, by a professor from Virginia Tech that 
“over the next few months we will be studying Flint water quality issues...” Results 
indicating elevated lead levels in homes were reported as part of this study in late 
August. In September 2015, information was reported in news articles that 


13

November 16, 2015 


pediatricians in the City had data suggesting an increase in children’s blood lead 
levels in two zip codes in the Flint area. 

Prior to these dates, the City had already completed the required two 6-month 
rounds of monitoring and the DEQ had made a determination that the City must 
install corrosion control treatment as documented in correspondence dated 
August 17, 2015. 

VIII. QUESTIONS RAISED REGARDING THE DEQ’S ACTIONS 

1 . What was the DEQ’s response to the USEPA’s inquiry in February 2015 
regarding the optimized corrosion control treatment being implemented by the 
City under the LCR? 

The DEQ indicated that the City was complying with the LCR, the lead 90th 
percentile level was below the action level of 15 ppb, and the City was already 
conducting the second round of monitoring which would provide for a determination 
of whether additional treatment needed to be installed. It should be noted that once 
treatment is designated as optimal, there is no requirement in the LCR that lead 
results be lower than they were before treatment was installed. The 90th percentile 
only needs to be lower than the action level in the LCR. 

2. Did the DEQ attempt to mislead the USEPA in a February 27, 2015, e-mail 
responding to the USEPA’s inquiry regarding Optimal Corrosion Control 
Treatment? 

No. There was no attempt by the DEQ to mislead the USEPA. There is an e-mail 
from Steve Busch, Jackson and Lansing District Supervisor, Office of Drinking 
Water and Municipal Assistance, indicating that the City was practicing a corrosion 
control program. What was meant was that the City was performing the required 
monitoring to determine whether or not they were practicing optimized corrosion 
control. The DEQ subsequently clarified its position in follow-up e-mails and 
telephone conversations with the USEPA. 

3. When General Motors announced its intent to terminate water service from the 
City and purchase water from Genesee County, should this have been a sign 
that there were concerns with the quality of the water after the switch to the 
Flint River? 

No. General Motors made a decision regarding the quality of water for its 
manufacturing processes. At the time, the company indicated that the chloride levels 
were above limits acceptable as part of the manufacturing facility’s limit for 
production purposes. The level of chlorides in the water treated by the City was not 
a human health or aesthetic concern. 

Chloride does have a secondary maximum contaminant level established by the 
USEPA, not for health-related concerns but rather for taste and aesthetic concerns. 
Concentrations greater than the secondary maximum contaminant level of 
250 milligrams per liter (mg/I) become objectionable due to taste. According to the 
City’s records, the chloride concentration in the Flint River water is generally about 
45 mg/I and the treated water chloride concentration leaving the water treatment 


14 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


plant ranges between 55 and 65 mg/I. It should be noted that the City uses ferric 
chloride as its primary coagulant, although this does not add a significant amount of 
chloride to the finished water. 

4. Has the USEPA subsequently admitted that the LCR is subject to differing 
interpretations such as that presented by the DEQ? 

Yes. On November 3, 2015, the USEPA issued a memorandum regarding the “Lead 
and Copper Rule Requirements for Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment for Large 
Drinking Water Systems”. This memorandum addresses concerns raised about the 
application of the LCR, specifically the requirements pertaining to maintenance of 
optimal corrosion control treatment, in situations in which a large water system 
ceases to purchase treated water and switches to a new drinking water source. The 
USEPA states that this type of situation rarely arises, that the language of the LCR 
does not specifically discuss such circumstances, and that there are differing 
possible interpretations of the LCR with respect to how the rule’s optimal corrosion 
control treatment procedures apply to this situation. The memorandum is intended to 
clarify, on a prospective basis, steps agencies should take or apply in the future. 
USEPA’s new guidance provides acknowledgement that the LCR is subject to 
differing interpretations. The DEQ’s interpretation and application of the LCR in this 
situation was in compliance with the federal SDWA and Act 399. 

5. Did the DEQ reject any of the samples submitted by the City? 

Yes, samples at two locations were excluded from the compliance calculation in 
conformance with rules issued by the USEPA. 

According to the LCR, compliance samples must be a first draw, 1 -liter sample 
collected from a cold water, kitchen or bathroom tap after the tap has stood unused 
for not less than 6 hours. Federal and state rules require community public water 
systems to identify a pool of targeted high-risk sampling sites, called Tier 1 sampling 
sites. For a municipality such as the City, the Tier 1 sampling pool must consist of 
single family structures that are: 

• served by a lead service line, 

• contain lead pipes, or 

• contain copper pipes soldered with lead installed after 1 982 but before Michigan 
enacted the ban on solder containing high concentrations of lead (June, 1988). 

As long as a community has Tier 1 sites that contain lead service lines, they are 
required to collect at least 50 percent of their compliance samples from these lead 
service line sites. Finally, federal and state rules specify that “Sampling sites may 
not include faucets that have point of use or point of entry treatment devices 
designed to remove inorganic contaminants.” Such treatment devices include home 
softeners, iron filters, etc. Samples collected from multiple family residences, 
commercial buildings, institutional facilities, or single family structures with 
point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment can only be used if the community has 
insufficient Tier 1 sites available. 


15 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


One of the samples submitted by the City was excluded from the 90th percentile 
compliance calculation in the latest monitoring period because it was taken from a 
tap at a non-residential site (non-Tier 1). The other sample result that was excluded 
was collected from a single family home that has a whole house treatment system. 
Both of these sites are, therefore, excluded from the compliance consideration based 
upon federal and state rules. 

6. Did the DEQ review the information submitted by the City to ensure all 
samples were from Tier 1 sites? 

Yes. The DEQ examined the information submitted and certified by the City that its 
LCR compliance monitoring sites consisted entirely of Tier 1 criteria sites, which met 
the requirements of this rule to maximize sampling of high-risk targeted sites. 

During the initial implementation of the LCR approximately 25 years ago, water 
supplies were required to complete a materials evaluation of their distribution system 
to identify a pool of targeted, high-risk sampling sites. These sites were to be 
categorized into one of three Tiers (1, 2, or 3) based on risk. The DEQ created an 
LCR reporting template for water systems to identify each compliance sampling site 
by Tier, service line material, and building plumbing material. 

If a water system has sufficient Tier 1 sites, they are required to sample them before 
using any lower Tier sites. Furthermore, if they have sufficient sampling sites with 
lead service lines, they are required to use them to make up at least 50 percent of 
their sampling pool each monitoring period. Water supplies are also required to use 
the same sampling sites each time or explain on their LCR reporting form why they 
were unable to do so. Finally, the water system is required to certify all of the 
information they provide on the LCR reporting form is factual. 

The DEQ must rely upon the public water system to identify appropriate sampling 
sites for LCR monitoring. The DEQ public water supply program has no control or 
authority over service lines or domestic plumbing. As a result, we have no records 
on construction standards or materials used by customers for these components. If 
these records exist, they are kept by plumbing code enforcement officials. 

In 2015, City employees again certified that the information submitted on their LCR 
monitoring reports for the two 6-month rounds of monitoring conducted after they 
began treating the Flint River were accurate, and DEQ staff review of that 
information indicated it was in compliance with the monitoring requirements. The 
DEQ had no reason to question the validity of the City’s reports until the DEQ heard 
City employees revealing to the media that the City did not know for certain if its 
compliance monitoring was collected from homes with lead service lines. As a 
result, the DEQ began to investigate the City’s monitoring sites. As the City began to 
transfer its customer information to electronic records, the DEQ determined from the 
information available that a significant number of these sites that had been listed as 
having lead service lines either did not have them or the information was unavailable. 
On November 9, 2015, the DEQ notified the City in writing that it would be necessary 
to conduct a complete assessment of its sampling pool and report back its findings 
by December 30, 2015. The DEQ is now awaiting the City’s response. 


16 



Privileged Attorney-Client Communication 


November 16, 2015 


7. Did the DEQ believe the levels of lead found at 212 Browning in April 2015 
were indicative of a system-wide problem? 

High levels of lead were collected in samples taken from this residence. It was 
determined to be coming from an unusually long lead service line. For some reason, 
this home was not connected to the water main that ran in front of the house, but 
rather to a main located on a street several houses away. The City replaced the lead 
service line May 6, 201 5. Since the internal plumbing of the house is plastic, it was 
believed that replacement of the lead service line would resolve the problem, and 
subsequent sampling taken at this address showed that replacement of the service 
line did mitigate the problem. There was, therefore, no reason to believe that this 
was indicative of a system-wide problem. 

8. Do the DEQ’s sampling instructions comply with the LCR? 

The DEQ continues to seek official clarification from the USEPA regarding the 
sampling protocols. The DEQ’s sampling recommendations were developed to 
ensure compliance with the USEPA’s guidance provided in the preamble to their lead 
and copper regulations that said that household use should be “typical” for a 
residential customer on the day before sample collection for lead and copper. Early 
in the implementation of the LCR, the DEQ had encountered too many situations 
where compliance samples had been collected from kitchen and bathroom taps that 
had not been used in days and in some cases, even weeks, resulting in excessively 
stagnated water and correspondingly high lead levels that did not represent typical 
exposure expected after overnight stagnation. To incorporate these results into 
further regulatory decision making could have led to actions that were not indicative 
of a true public health threat. Further complicating this issue was the USEPA’s direct 
implementation of the LCR in Washington, D.C., where it was learned that some 
“valid” lead results were not always being included in compliance calculations. 
Subsequently, the USEPA made invalidation of samples for any reason much more 
difficult. In order to ensure samples were taken at customer taps representative of 
typical use, the DEQ devised the current recommendations for ensuring appropriate 
but not excessive stagnation for LCR monitoring. 

The DEQ continues to believe it is appropriate to ensure that taps being sampled are 
representative of typical household use and are sampled during the recommended 
stagnation period of 6-18 hours. The LCR does not say the result should represent 
the “absolute worst case” condition - it talks about sampling the highest risk 
locations (lead plumbing, lead service lines, high lead content solder piping, etc.) 
after overnight stagnation and then collecting a first draw sample so as not to flush 
elevated lead from that tap at that point in time. There are a number of other states 
that share the DEQ’s interpretation of the rule and the DEQ encourages the USEPA 
to provide official clarification directed at all states with primacy.

9. Does the DEQ require the use of small-neck bottles to obtain samples? 

No. The DEQ does not mandate the use of small-neck bottles; it is the sampling 
method that is specified in both the federal SDWA and Act 399. Each certified 
drinking water laboratory provides bottles to their customers upon request for any 
particular analysis in accordance with the specifications in the SDWA. The bottles 
provided by the DEQ Drinking Water Laboratory for a lead and copper corrosion 
control sample meet these requirements.

Happy Thanksgiving all. Looks like there is sneed for a media update. 

You may hear some grumbles about the pre-registration requirement for the Listening Session 12/2 at 
Mott. This was based on logistical considerations - availability, cost, safety and secure parking. Also , to give 40 
people 2-3 minutes to speak will require 80-120 minutes time and this does not lend itself to an open town hall 
meeting format if we are going to effectively listen to and discuss with participants. 

I would suggest that we use funds to record and transcribe these session and a video of it be available on a 
website ,open to the public. See below. 

We will need some help with hosting identifying speakers, bringing the microphone to them , registration , etc 
.Would this be a role for MSU ? This group should make an effort to reflect the diversity of Flint. 


For video recording , consider Paul Herring , SpectacleProductions, 405 University Blvd ,Flint, 

cell office 


www. spectacleproductions. com . 

If we have more registrants than space , we can put them on the list for subsequent meetings which must occur 
in a timely manner. 

If we consider other sites, consider the requirements for public buildings in regard to open meetings. 

It may be time to officially contact Mayor Weaver about our plans and suggest to the Governor that we need 
an official representative to clarify our role and our intent to not conflict with the Mayor's public 
meetings. Perhaps , we need to be available to attend some of her meetings to listen also. 

Finally, our electrical power was shut off for maintenance that had to be completed before freezing weather so 
phones and computers were down. We will be open for business Monday 12/30. 

We are operating on a tight timeline and will need more resources and some media support to reflect the 
Governor's concern adequately to the citizens of Flint.

I agree with most of her statements and I hope her organization will vigorously share their position with the 
Governor and the legislature.lt is true that the Flint Water Advisory Task Force has a much more limited 
scope as an advisory body and has no legal authority.I hope Common Cause will also do a legal analysis 
of the emergency manager laws policies ,and procedure and inform the public.

I have located $25,000 to assist in paying for the FWATF communications needs. 1 would like added to the 
scope of work for them to update the Local Emergency Operations Support Plan (Pub 204) and train and 
exercise the plan with appropriate personnel. I attached the template we provide locals to use in developing the 
plan. Flint has a plan in place but with everything going on and based on interactions recently I am not 
convinced it is followed or if they even know about it. I am certain the new Mayor is not aware of the Local 
Support Plan.

INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDE 


I. Purpose 

This document is designed to serve as a guide for municipalities with a population of 10,000 residents or 
above that have elected to incorporate into the County Emergency Management Program and need to 
develop a Support Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) following the Administrative Rules for Section 19, 
1976 PA 390, as amended. In accordance with these rules, the Support EOP shall be consistent with the 
County Emergency Operations Plan and will become part of the county plan. 

The preparation of a Support EOP will increase emergency preparedness through the definition of the 
responsibilities of local departments and agencies. The plan assigns tasks that need to be accomplished 
when an incident occurs, and describes how local and county emergency management efforts are 
related. Maintaining a current Support EOP also establishes eligibility to receive Section 19 funding in 
accordance with Section 19 of 1976 PA 390, as amended. If federal assistance does not become 
available after the Governor has declared a State of Disaster or Emergency, affected counties and 
municipalities can be eligible to receive state assistance up to $100,000 or 10% of their operating budget, 
whichever is less, to cover certain disaster related expenses. To be eligible for Section 19 funding, 
municipalities with a population of 10,000 and above that do not maintain an independent emergency 
management program must develop and submit a Support EOP to the county, and implement that plan in 
a timely manner at the beginning of the incident. 

II. Scope 

This document provides basic guidance and a template for the development of a Support EOP. The 
template (Attachment B) contains general information that can be adapted to any municipality. The 
annexes specify how the municipality will carry out common emergency support functions. 

Also included with this document is a sample Emergency Management Resolution (Attachment B) that 
appoints the County Emergency Management Coordinator as the Emergency Management Coordinator 
of the municipality, and outlines how emergency management efforts on the local level are organized in 
relation to the County Emergency Management Program. 

If either template is used, it should be reviewed and adjusted to the specific needs of each municipality. 
Municipalities that do not utilize the templates can develop individual plans or resolutions. Other available 
guiding materials for the development of EOPs include MSP/EMSHD Pub 201 (Local Planning Workbook) 
and FEMA Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101. 

III. Maintenance 

Pub 204 has been developed by MSP/EMHSD and is maintained to ensure compliance with current 
national planning standards and relevant state laws pertaining to emergency planning. This document 
was last updated in August 201 5 and supersedes the October 201 1 version. It will be updated every four 
years. 


DEVELOPING THE PLAN 

All stakeholders that are involved in the community response to emergencies and disasters should be 
involved in the development of the Support EOP. The County Emergency Management Program should 
work with the municipality to ensure that the plan is compatible with the County Emergency Operations 
Plan. A standardized planning approach can be used for the development of the Support EOP. 

I. Plan requirements 

The Administrative Rules for Section 19 of 1976 PA 390, as amended, establish four requirements for the 
development of Support EOPs. In accordance with these requirements, Support EOPs shall: 

1 . Describe the relationship between the County Emergency Management Program and the 
municipality: 


1 



The plan should state that the municipality has chosen to incorporate into the county program, 
coordinates emergency management related matters with the county program, and has assigned 
the County Emergency Management Coordinator as the responsible Emergency Management 
Coordinator for the municipality. 

2. Identify the municipality’s response procedures in relation to the county response 
procedures: 

The plan should establish annexes that describe common tasks that need to be accomplished 
when responding to an emergency or disaster, and assign responsibility for these tasks to 
municipal departments and other local agencies. The annexes should identify the responsible 
agencies on the local level that coordinate and share information with at the county level, and 
clarify joint responsibilities. Annexes in the Support EOP should also identify which annex or 
annexes they relate to in the County EOP. 

3. Be maintained in accordance with the standards and currentness of the county plan, be 
consistent with the county plan: 

The efforts described in local and county plans should be consistent and complement each other. 
To maintain the Support EOP in currentness with the County EOP, updates to the local plan are 
necessary whenever the county plan is updated. When the County EOP is updated, the Support 
EOP should be revised to ensure that it is still compatible with the county plan. 

4. Contain the signature of the Chief Executive Official (CEO) of the municipality, be 
forwarded to the county: 

After a new Support EOP has been developed or an existing plan has been updated, the 
signature of the CEO (Mayor, Township Supervisor) needs to be obtained. If a change of the 
CEO occurs, the plan needs to be reviewed and the signature of the new official obtained. After 
the plan is signed, a copy must be forwarded to the County Emergency Management Program, 
where it should be filed with the County EOP. 

II. Plan format 

The plan should consist of a Basic Plan section and functional annexes. 

The Basic Plan defines the purpose of the plan, provides a community profile, identifies hazards and 
community vulnerabilities, and describes the relationship between municipality and the County 
Emergency Management Program. 

The annexes identify specific emergency management and response tasks that need to be accomplished 
before, during and after an incident, and assign responsibility for carrying out these tasks to local 
agencies. Annexes should be organized by emergency response functions or tasked agencies and can 
be written in narrative or bulleted style. While municipalities are not required to mirror the format used in 
the county plan, this can be beneficial. The template included with this document uses a bulleted 
“Emergency Action Guidelines” format for its annexes. 

III. Planning process 

The following seven step planning process also utilized in County EOP development should be used to 
develop a Support EOP. For additional information on the process steps, please refer to MSP/EMSHD 
Pub 201 (Local Planning Workbook). 

1 . Form a collaborative planning team: 

The planning team is the group of individuals responsible for designing, developing, and 
implementing the Support EOP. It should include representatives from all agencies that are 
committed to participate in emergency response activities within the municipality. Other stakeholders 
that should be engaged in the planning process include representation from the municipality’s 
executive office, the County Emergency Management Program, agencies that can provide insight into 
necessary accommodations for groups or individuals requiring Functional Needs Support Services 
(FNSS), schools, etc. 


2 



2. Identify hazards and assess risks: 

The hazard analysis is the foundation upon which the municipality’s emergency planning efforts 
should be built. It identifies conditions or situations that have the potential to cause harm to people or 
property in the community. The hazard analysis process involves four steps. 

Step 1: A profile of the community is developed (demographic and economic make-up, geography 
and land-use, key facilities, etc.). 

Step 2: The development of a community profile is followed by the hazard identification, which should 
start with a review of the County Hazard Analysis or Hazard Mitigation Plan. Local resources should 
then be used to identify further hazards that are unique to the community and might not have been 
included in county documents. 

Step 3: The assessment of risks explores how likely it is that a risk will manifest itself in an incident, 
how often this might occur, where it might occur, and what the severity of impact would be. Hazards 
should be ranked based on the expected frequency of occurrence and severity of impact. 

Step 4: The vulnerability determination examines how susceptible citizens, property, infrastructure 
and critical systems are to the identified hazards. 

3. Determine Goals and Objectives: 

Developing clear goals and objectives will help the municipality to identify problems, issues and 
opportunities. Establishing goals outlines the vision of what the community wants to achieve. Goals 
can be pursued in the long-term, but need to be achievable. Objectives are specific and measurable 
strategies to achieve these goals. Often, multiple objectives will need to be established to support one 
goal. 

4. Plan Development: 

This step describes the conceptualization of the plan, which includes the generation and comparison 
of alternate strategies to achieve the established goals and objectives. This involves two tasks: 
Developing and analyzing courses of actions to be conducted during an incident, and identifying the 
resources that determine the capability of the municipality to take these actions. Developing actions 
allows planners to depict how an operation unfolds by building and working through a portrait of a 
potential event, including key decision points and participant activities. This helps to identify actions 
that occur and resources that will be required throughout the progression of an event. 

After identifying potential strategies to achieve established goals, an important sub-step in the 
conzeptualization of the plan is the evaluation of actions to ensure that the actions that are selected 
to be included in the plan are feasible. It is critical to determine if required resources are available or 
easily obtainable during an incident, and if actions are compliant with laws and regulations, such as 
local ordinances and resolutions, legal authorities, law enforcement standards, and Governor’s orders 
and directives. 

5. Plan Preparation, Review and Approval: 

When writing the plan, a simple format should be used. The finished plan must be compatible with the 
County EOP. This can be achieved by including references to the county plan, utilizing a similar 
format, or organizing annexes after similar emergency response functions. Feedback should be 
solicited from all stakeholders that are tasked within the plan, the County Emergency Management 
Program, and local elected officials. After the review process, necessary adjustments should be 
implemented. The municipality should adopt the plan by resolution, obtain the signature of the CEO, 
and forward a signed copy of the plan to the County Emergency Management Program. 

6. Plan implementation and update: 

The last step is to implement, maintain and update the plan. Plan updates are required after change 
of the CEO or when the County EOP has been updated. Plan reviews should also be considered after 
plan activations (during incidents or exercises), changes in operational resources, and changes in the 
community and/or hazard profile of the municipality. Lessons learned from actual events and 
exercises are essential to the evaluation of a plan’s effectiveness, and help to determine if the plan is: 

■ Adequate: The concept of operations identifies and addresses critical tasks effectively.

Emergency Management Resolution. The Emergency Management Resolution should appoint the 
County Emergency Management Coordinator as the Emergency Management Coordinator responsible 
for the municipality, describe the local emergency management organization and its relationship to the 
County Emergency Management Program, and provide a means for the local legislative body to exercise 
the authority vested in them by 1976 PA 390, as amended. Attachment A provides a sample Emergency 
Management Resolution.

Support Emergency Operations Plan 

P ro m u lg at i o n Docu m e nt 


Officials of (Municipality) , in conjunction with County and State Emergency Eanagement (EM) agencies, have 
developed this Support Emergency Operations Plan that will enhance the local emergency response capability. 

This plan, when used properly and updated, will assist local government officials to accomplish their primary 
responsibilities of protecting lives and property in their community. This plan and its provisions will become 
official when it has been signed and dated below by the Chief Executive Official (CEO) of the municipality.

Support Emergency Operations Plan 

A ppro va l a nd Impl e m e nt ation 

The Support Emergency Operations Plan, referred to in this document as the Support EOP, describes how 
(Municipality) will handle emergency situations in cooperation with the (County) Emergency Management 
Program. The Support EOP assigns responsibilities to agencies for coordinating emergency response activities 
before, during, and after any type of emergency or disaster. The Support EOP does not contain specific 
instructions as to how each department will respond to an emergency; these can be found in the plan annexes 
or separate Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). 

The goal of the Support EOP is to coordinate emergency response efforts to save lives, reduce injuries, and 
preserve property. The Support EOP addresses emergency issues before and after an emergency, but its 
primary goals are to assemble, mobilize and coordinate a team of responders that can respond to any 
emergency, and describe response procedures in relation to the county response procedures. 

The Support EOP will use a graduated response strategy that is in proportion to the scope and severity of an 
emergency. (Municipality) will plan, prepare and activate resources for local emergencies that affect the local 
area (or a specific site) and/or widespread disasters that affect the entire state and/or nation. 

The Support EOP was developed by a Local Planning Team (LPT). The LPT consists of key departments 
covering emergency functions such as law enforcement, fire, public works, and public health. The team works to 
establish and monitor programs, reduce the potential for hazard events in the community through planning, 
review, and training, and assist the (County) Emergency Management Program in developing and maintaining 
the County EOP. 

The Support EOP must be signed by the current CEO each time it is updated, with the exception of the following 
activities: 

1 . Minor updates e.g. changing system names, grammar, spelling or layout changes 

2. Updates to the annexes 

These activities may be updated in the plan without the CEO signature by the following individuals: 

1 . Emergency Management Liaison 

2. Department head responsible for an annex 

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5 facilitates a standard management approach to major 
incidents, the National Incident Management System (NIMS). NIMS is administered as part of the National 
Response Framework (NRF) which integrates the federal government into a single, all discipline, and all- 
hazards plan. NIMS will provide a nationwide approach that enables federal, state, tribal and local government 
agencies to “work effectively and efficiently together to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic 
incidents, regardless of cause, size or complexity.” This Support EOP has integrated NIMS concepts, including 
the Incident Command System (ICS), and language to help incident management operate in accordance to the 
NIMS using the guidance provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 

During an emergency, all response personnel will use the ICS to manage the incident and employ emergency 
resources at the site. The Emergency Operation Center (EOC) will coordinate additional resources when 
needed. This EOP will be used during community recovery after an emergency. 


This plan supersedes all previous plans.

Support Emergency Operations Plan 


Purpose 

(Municipality) has elected to incorporate into the (County) Emergency Management Program. As partners 
in the five phases of emergency management, mitigation, preparedness, prevention, response and 
recovery, (Municipality) and the (County) Emergency Management Program share joint responsibilities. 
The (Municipality) Support EOP has been developed to identify these responsibilities. It is to be used in 
concurrence with the County EOP. In accordance with Section 19 of the Michigan Emergency 
Management Act (1976 PA 390, as amended), activation of this this plan at the beginning of a disaster or 
emergency also establishes eligibility to receive state assistance for disaster related expenses incurred 
during a State of Emergency or Disaster declared by the Governor, for which federal assistance is 
unavailable. 

Scope 

The (Municipality) Support EOP is an adaptable document that can be applied to all hazards. Due to the 
unique nature of emergencies, it may become necessary to deviate from the contents of the plan when 
responding to an incident. Agencies that have been assigned supporting roles in this plan have developed 
and will maintain SOPs that provide systematic instructions for accomplishing their assigned functions. 
The local government conducts additional activities, such as personnel training, participation in exercises, 
public information, land-use planning, etc., to support emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response 
efforts. To facilitate efficient emergency management operations, (Municipality) continues to implement 
the NIMS.

Plan Development and Maintenance 

To ensure that this Support EOP addresses the needs of the community and is consistent with the 
(County) EOP, this document was developed in a cooperative, whole community effort between municipal 
government, local community, and the County Emergency Management Program. The Support EOP is 
updated after every change of the municipal CEO or update to the County EOP. After the plan is adopted 
by resolution of the (council/board) and approved by the CEO, it is forwarded to the County Emergency

“Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities.” 

4. Integration with the (County) EOP, (County) hazard mitigation plan, MEMP, etc. 

C. Community profile: 

(Municipality) is located in the ( geographical area) of (County) . The community has a population 
of (number) residents. Approximately (percentage) of residents have been recognized as 
individuals with Access and Functional Needs. Many of the residents that require Functional Needs 
Support Services (FNSS) reside in congregate care centers, while others reside in non-group 
homes where support is provided as needed or on-call. 

D. Hazard and threat analysis: 

According to the (County) (Hazard Mitigation Plan/Hazard Analysis) , communities in the county 
are most vulnerable to: (common hazards) . Areas within (Municipality) that are especially 
vulnerable to these hazards are: (locations) . Additional hazards that have been identified as 
unique to (Municipality) include: (unique local hazards) . 

(Number) sites that contain extremely hazardous materials are located in (Municipality) . Facility 
owners have reported the types of hazardous materials that are stored on-site, as required by the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA). Pursuant to SARA Title III 
requirements, off-site emergency response plans have been developed by the Local Emergency 
Planning Committee (LEPC) to prepare fire departments for responding to the release of the 
specific hazardous materials on these sites. 

E. Relationship between municipality and County Emergency Management Program:

protection in (Municipality) . 

B. Some incidents occur with enough warning that necessary notification can be issued to ensure the 
appropriate level of preparation. Other incidents occur with no advanced warning. 

C. Depending upon the severity and magnitude of the situation, local resources may not be adequate 
to deal with an incident. It may be necessary to request assistance through volunteer 
organizations, the private sector, mutual aid agreements (MAAs)/memorandums of understanding 
(MOUs), and/or county, state and federal sources. When provided, these will supplement, not 
substitute for, relief provided by local jurisdictions. 

D. All emergency response agencies within (Municipality) that have been tasked in the plan are 
considered to be available to respond to emergency incidents. Agencies will work to save lives, 
protect property, relieve human suffering, sustain survivors, stabilize the incident, repair essential 
facilities, restore services and protect the environment. 

E. When a jurisdiction receives a request to assist another jurisdiction, reasonable actions will be 
taken to provide the assistance as requested. 

F. Emergency planning is a work-in-progress; the Support EOP is consistently reviewed and updated. 

G. During an emergency or disaster, parts of the plan may need to be improvised or modified, if 
necessary, based on the situation. 

Concept of Operations 

A. Activation of the Support EOP and declaration of a local state of emergency: 

When a threat is perceived, the Emergency Management Liaison activates the this Support EOP 
and the local Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to facilitate activities that ensure the safety of 
people, property and environment. Pursuant to 1976 PA 390, as amended, the (CEO/other official 
designated by charter) may declare a local state of emergency for (Municipality) if 
circumstances indicate that the occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury, or 
loss of life or property exist. In the absence of the (CEO/other official designated by charter) , 
pursuant to local legislation, the (title) is authorized to declare a local state of emergency. Upon a 
local declaration, PA 390 authorizes the the (Chief Executive Official/other official designated 
by charter) to issue directives as to travel restrictions on local roads. To facilitate activities that 
ensure the safety of people, property and environment, a local declaration also activates this 
Support EOP and the municipal Emergency Operations Center (EOC). A local state of emergency 
shall not be continued or renewed for a period in excess of seven days except with the consent of 
the governing body of the municipality. 

B. The following procedures are conducted and coordinated with the county in response to an 
incident: 

1. The Emergency Management Liaison will perceive the threat, assess the hazard and 
ensure that municipal emergency response agencies, elected officials and County EMC 
are notified of the situation. 

2. Municipal agencies assess the nature and scope of the emergency or disaster. 

3. If the situation can be handled locally, the following guidelines are used: 

a. The Emergency Management Liaison advises the CEO and coordinates all 
local emergency response actions.

declare a State of Emergency or State of Disaster in accordance with procedures set forth 
in 1976 PA 390, as amended. If the emergency occurs solely within the confines of the 
municipality, the county shall not request state assistance or the Declaration of a State of 
Disaster or Emergency unless requested to do so by the municipal CEO.

Rich 


I have located $25,000 to assist in paying for the FWATF communications needs. I would like 
added to the scope of work for them to update the Local Emergency Operations Support Plan (Pub 
204) and train and exercise the plan with appropriate personnel. I attached the template we 
provide locals to use in developing the plan. Flint has a plan in place but with everything going on 
and based on interactions recently I am not convinced it is followed or if they even know about it. 

I am certain the new Mayor is not aware of the Local Support Plan. 


Please let me know if you need additional on this or have questions.

• Lead is a potent neurotoxin with lifelong, 
multigenerational impacts 

• Blood lead levels (BLL) 5 ug/dL or more 
considered elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) 

» Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

• NO safe blood lead level 

• Disproportionately impacts low income and 
minority children 


Primary prevention is most important 


Primary Prevention 



“Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear to 
be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental and 
housing policies should encourage PREVENTION 
of all exposure to lead.” 



“Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary 
Prevention.” 2012 CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention. 


Impact on cognition 



Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

« Decrease in IQ 

An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low 
IQs (<70) 

Implications for early intervention, special education services, 
employment, incarceration, life achievement, etc

“For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 billion in medical care 
costs, as well as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity 
analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) per year in lost economic 
productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure.” 


“The present value of Michigan’s economic losses 
attributable to lead exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year- 
olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. blood lead levels) to 
$4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per year in 


loss of future lifetime earnings.”

Quick Introduction to 





Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) 

• ACEs are potentially traumatic events that can have 
negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. 

• Also referred to as toxic stress or childhood trauma. 

• As number of ACEs increase, the risk for health 
problems increase in a strong and graded fashion. 

• An ACE score of 6 or more results in a 20 year 
decrease in life expectancy. 

• CDC ACE study 

• Kaiser Permanente from 1995 to 1997 with more than 
17,000 participants.

ACE/Toxic Stress 

• Many chronic diseases/disparities in 
adults are determined decades earlier, by 
experiences in childhood (0-6 critical) 

• Lead exposure is an ACE/toxic stress 




u; HOW 











Now what can we do??? 


Assess the impact of the exposure 

• Health impact 

• BLL 

• Longitudinal neurodevelopmentalf/u 

• Cord blood Pb, brain injury markers, epigenetics 

• Retrospective fetal deaths, IUGR 

• Nutrition impact 

• Psychosocial impact 

• Water quality/infrastructure impact 


Continued monitoring 

• Academic/publichealth collaborations

Subject: RE: Please provide feedback: Governor's statement on Flint water crisis 

Here is a revised statement incorporating Rich's suggested changes: 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water 
situation and I've read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the 
processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 

""The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, 
state and federal officials to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing 
hundreds of documents at all levels of government and from the public health science 
community. 


1 


"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing 
investigation. As they uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. Their report 
may take another month or so, but if we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to 
take immediate action. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this 
crisis. I want Michigan to be the state that is known for the safest water in the nation. 

""When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for 
error in testing for lead and other toxins. I understand there can be disagreements 
within the scientific community. That is why I have told my directors at MDEQ and 
DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on the Flint water issue to the 
state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should be able to 
affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have 
safe drinking water and that we're doing proper monitoring and remediation of blood 
levels and other health impacts over the long term. 

"I want the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am 
that this has happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the 
water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor 
Karen Weaver, and we're going to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the 
state can offer assistance. 

"What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure residents there that we will 
work hard to make things right.”

Subject: Re: Please provide feedback: Governor's statement on Flint water crisis 

This is the best narrative I have seen that actually describes how we feel about the 
situation and our resolve to make things right. A few thoughts: 

We might think about a "lead in" to your second para in the statement. Something like 
"The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, 
State and Federal officials and complete an independent fact based analysis. They have 
reviewed hundreds of documents at all levels of government and from the public health 
science community and continue to do so. 

Para 3 might unintentionally suggest that there are public health stakeholders who are 
not as serious as the governor. This may be an overreach, but may I suggest 


2 


"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for error 
in testing for lead and other toxins. I understand there can be disagreements within the 
scientific community. That is why I have directed my Directors of MDEQ. and DHHS to 
invite every external scientist who has worked on the Flint water issue to the state 
laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should be able to affirm 
that every testing protocol and conclusion validates that Flint citizens will have safe 
drinking water, and that we are doing everything possible to ensure proper monitoring 
and remediation of blood levels and physical or neurological impacts over the long 
term. And I want the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very 
sorry I am that this has happened." 

Nick and Dan might not like the "invite" but I spoken with them both and they of course 
will support whatever the Boss decides. 

Thanks,

Colleagues: 

Many of us have reached the conclusion that our messaging on the Flint 
water crisis has room for improvement. We haven't conveyed to 
citizens the depth of our concern over the situation. I've crafted a 
statement to be made by the Governor, and would like you to review it. 

This statement is meant to manage expectations on the timing of 
concrete conclusions (the task force report may not come out for 
another month at least) and to signal that action may come sooner than 
that (we plan to reach out to Mayor Weaver, for example, and perhaps 
hold a press conference with her in January announcing some next 
steps). 

Here is the statement: 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the 
Flint water situation and I've read the report from the Office of the 
Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough

continuing investigation. As they uncover more facts, it's clear to me we 
can do better. The report may take another month or so, but if we need 
to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action.

"The bottom line is we'll take responsibility for our part in Flint's water 
crisis. I'm committed to partnering with all of the stakeholders who are 
as concerned about public health as I am. I vow to make sure that Flint 
citizens will have safe drinking water. And I'm so very sorry that this 
happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 
million to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. 
On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to sit

Here is a statement from the Governor that will go out around 2-2:30 p.m. to the media. We’ll also give a heads 
up to executive staffers and some others. - Meegan 


When I became aware that the city of Flint’s water showed elevated lead levels and that the state’s handling of 
the situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority and appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 


The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of Flint, 
Genesee County, state and federal officials. 


Although the task force’s final report is not yet completed, it has made me aware of some interim findings and 
corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its 
citizens safe and informed. 


We’ll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns. 


l 



In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I’ve determined that it’s appropriate to 
accept it. I’m also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force. 


But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific 
community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human 
Services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping us improve 
Flint water. Let’s share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at accurate and mutually 
supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we’re using the very best testing protocols to 
ensure Flint residents have safe drinking water and that we’re taking steps to protect their health over the short 
and long term. 


I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan 
citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging 
infrastructure. 


I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That’s why I’m taking the actions today 
to ensure a culture of openness and trust. We’ve already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water 
filters, and help in other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we’re going to meet soon to 
discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 


These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our task 
force. When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we’re committed to doing everything we can to 
protect the well-being of our citizens.

Team: 

Today Harvey and I met with the Flint Water Task Force. It was a good meeting. People were pleased with the G's 
statement from the prior day. Captain Kelenske joined us and we had a very good discussion about moving forward with 
the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency Coordinating Committee (FIACC). Tim Becker and Captain Kelenske 
provided me with a fair amount of input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for a State of Emergency which 
Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I have distilled all of this into a two page plan that I 
want your edits and comments on and a one page organizational chart (now presented in the "governor's colors" 
according to our fine people in Communications). Spoiler alert— I made Captain Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole 
shebang (with the Colonel's blessing) so Harvey wouldn't get lonely. 

Here is my ask of you: 

1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the Governor either New Year's Day or 
Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday (Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the meeting January 7 along with 
financial resources that we still need some estimates on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change the narrative focus on 
Monday's Genesee County declaration of emergency 

I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge period but I do appreciate everyone's 
efforts and I know the Boss really does as well. 

Regards, 

Rich

A Proposal to Create the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee 

(FIACC) 


In collaboration with the Flint After-Action Task Force, MSP Captain Chris Kelenske, DHHS Chief Deputy 
Tim Becker and DHFIS Director Nick Lyon, Harvey Hollins and Rich Baird are recommending the 
immediate creation of the above referenced entity, with its sustained role and responsibility enabled 
under the Governor's Executive Order. 

Statement of Need 

Due to a combination of resource constraints, inexperienced personnel, "silo" bureaucratic processes 
and reactionary approaches to immediate problems, there is a nearly complete lack of coordination, 
communication, and connected management amongst all the departments and stakeholders who must 
work together to ensure Flint's return to clean, safe water and to coordinate mid and long term efforts 
to mitigate and address future health and behavioral consequences from lead ingestion. This group 
MUST be stood up regardless of whether (or when) the conditions required for a declaration of 
emergency are met by the City, County, State or Federal authorizers. This coordinating body must 
include: 

• The creation of a routine information process between all parties. 

• Pursuit of other avenues of funding including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• While the Emergency Management Act or the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
may be mechanisms to fix the issues in Flint, portions of the Emergency Management Act outlining 
management of events are applicable and should be implemented without delay (e.g. Local 
emergency operations plans/emergency operations guides as well as emergency operations support 
plans). 

Action Plan and Establishing the FIACCC 

It appears that a request for a Governor's declaration may be from the county as soon as January 4, 
2016. The state's Emergency Coordinator (Capt. Kelenske) will evaluate the request and provide a 
recommendation whether to issue a declaration, following established protocol and due diligence. But 
immediately, we will: 


1 . Establish an interagency workgroup Chaired and Vice-Chaired by Harvey Hollins and Chris Kelenske, 
respectively, and be comprised of DHHS, MDEQ, MSP, Treasury, Genesee County, City of Flint, MDE, 
LARA and external Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Civil Rights may be added at a later time. If 
additional agencies/stakeholders who can assist with accomplishing the action plan are needed, 
they will be added. Personnel must be goal oriented, transparent with findings and measures of 
progress, and able to work toward accomplishing the Incident Action Plan created by the state in a 
timely manner. A draft Organization Chart is attached under separate cover. 

2. This body should be created by Executive Order and it must complement and not replace the 
current system under the Emergency Management Act. In fact, it should demonstrate how to best 
leverage support where existing laws fall short under a man-made emergency. 

3. Utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as appropriate. 

4. Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive, and legislative levels as 
determined appropriate. 

5. Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 

Interagency Workgroup Objectives 

1 . Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 





■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to all stakeholders and interested parties. 

■ Logistics plan for distribution and serving homebound citizens with water and 
filtration 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods. 

■ Nutrition education and support 

■ Coping with lead exposure (care, monitoring, neurodevelopmental screening, access 
to DBP specialists, psychologists/psychiatrists, expanded county services, etc.) 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community of the situation 
and actions taken. 

■ Identify existing Public Information outlets within the city, county, and state. 

■ Establish a Joint Information Center 

■ Provide for Emergency Alerts and Updates 

■ Leverage public and private education schools 

■ Determine official information flow and approval of information. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water 
system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 

■ Develop priorities, costs, and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades 
as part of a long term recovery plan. 

■ Seek partners to assist (NGOs, Foundations, Business, etc.) 

■ Implement the plan. 

Final Thoughts 

After the team provides input to this document, I would ask that Governor Snyder review and approve 
the approach, authorize Harvey Hollins to get the plan to Mayor Weaver no later than this weekend, and 
then proactively communicate the plan regardless of whether we get an Emergency declaration or not. 

Also, we do believe setting up an Emergency Command Center which requires 24/7 staffing is sensible 
until AFTER Genesee County has demonstrated they did all they could and couldn't solve the problem. 
That is what is required under the law. 







CITY OF FLINT 

INCIDENT ACTION PLAN 


STATE OF EMERGENCY 


Objectives: 


To provide short term relief and long term solutions in addressing the man-made emergency of 
increased lead levels in the City of Flint (the "City") water system resulting from the switch to Flint River 
as the City's water source as well as the threat to public health related to elevated blood lead levels in 
Flint residents, without interruption of the provision of public safety and other essential public services. 
Due to the fluidic nature of emergencies and the complexity of the City of Flint's declared emergency, 
this plan serves as a framework and may be altered as the emergency develops. 

The Response Framework 

The purpose of this plan is to organize efforts on behalf of the city to assess the extent of the City's 
infrastructure needs and risks to public health, provide immediate relief to those who are at risk, and 
establish long term solutions. In addition, the city must ascertain what immediate relief and long term 
solutions the City is capable of implementing based on what resources are available. For any activities 
that are beyond the resource capacity of the City, external sources of funding, supplies, and manpower 
must be sought. 

There are a number of steps that must be taken in accordance with the Flint Emergency Support 
Operations Plan (SEOP), in order for the City to be compliant with the Genesee County Emergency 
Action Guidelines. These include the activation of the Incident Management Team, the Emergency 
Operation Center, and the sharing of essential documents with the County, including this plan. 
Information must also be shared by the City's Public Information Officer on a regular basis, as required 
by the SEOP. 

This plan calls for the provision of immediate relief to those at risk in our community. Special 
consideration must be given to residents who belong to underserved groups, such as those who are 
homebound, undocumented, in poverty, etc. Additional consideration must also be given to the 
equitable provision of services throughout our community in order to equally protect the health and 
safety of every member of our community. 

Implementation of this plan is to be conducted by the Incident Management Team, which will monitor 
the effective delivery of goods and services in order to address the conditions of the emergency. 

Understanding the Issue: 

October 1, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a Public Health Emergency after 
elevated blood-lead levels were found among children in the City of Flint. This incident correlates with 
elevated levels of lead found in the City's drinking water after the City switched water sources in April of 


2014 to the Flint River. The scope of this problem appears to be limited to Flint City Water Customers 
and their dependents. Public agencies from several levels of government, as well as charitable, nonprofit 
organizations have partnered with the City to provide immediate relief to Flint residents, including the 
expansion of health services, the provision of bottled water and NSF rated water filters. The city is also 
seeking long term infrastructure improvements to eliminate lead and other contaminants from the 
water system. 

Gov. Rick Snyder appointed a task force to review "actions regarding water use and testing in Flint" and 
to make recommendations for future guidelines: Members of the state task force are Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants, Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council, Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center. 

In an effort to halt the further escalation of this crisis, the City returned to receiving its water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) on October 16, 2015. Since that time, additional 
corrosion control program has started, estimating a reduction of lead levels over the next six months. In 
light of these efforts, concerns surrounding the quality of water and health of the residents persist to 
the point that Mayor Karen Weaver declared a State of Emergency on December 14, 2015 so as to 
resolve this crisis once and for all. 

The current challenge facing the City is providing immediate relief and long term solutions of the quality 
of the water and health of residents while the City remains in a financially critical condition. It is hoped 
and expected that higher levels of government recognize this emergency as it pertains to the condition 
of the City's infrastructure and health of its residents, and do all things necessary to assist the City in the 
provision of relief and the execution of capital improvement projects that will eliminate the causes of 
this emergency. 

Enhancing Understanding: 

Information Collection 

Essential Elements of Information (EEls) can be qualified as the City's water tests containing lead results, 
the verification of lead water lines (both public and private), and health information. Water testing is 
performed by the City's water plant in cooperation with the MDEQ.. The verification of lead water lines is 
being handled by University of Michigan Flint, who is currently digitizing the City's water line 
information and PSI Engineering, who is initiating the effort to verify lead lines by excavating an initial 
150 residential lines. This information allows the Incident Management Team to assess the current 
condition of the emergency by way of determining the water quality and the condition of the water 
distribution infrastructure. 


Information Analysis 

The City has sought partners to assist in the analysis and attenuation of complex data. Wayne State 
University's center for Urban Studies has agreed to assist the City in its efforts to document and track 
lead water lines, water test results, and filter distribution with geographic information system (GIS) 
technology. This allows for easily updateable, digestible information to be presented to officials. 

Assessment of Impacts 

The City will need assistance in determining the total cost of damage done to the public health and 
infrastructure. As of now, only portions of this damage are visible. 

PSI is providing some assistance by excavating 150 residential water lines to verify that they are 
comprised of lead. This is an initial step, but not enough. More resources will be needed to continue this 
process. 

Continuous Situational Awareness 

It is important that the Emergency Management Team receive continuous information regarding water 
testing results, lead water line numbers, and filter distribution information in order to gain a realistic 
and current perspective. Much of his information is currently available on the City's website 
(cityofflint.com) and more is added each week by the PIO team. 

Actions taken in Response to the Emergency 

Activation of the Incident Management Team 

Upon the declaration of Emergency by Mayor Weaver, the Support Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP) 
was activated. The SEOP calls upon the Incident Management Team to generate the Incident Action Plan 
(IAP. Each member of this team serves a specific function as it relates to addressing the causes and 
effects of the emergency. The Emergency Management Team roster can be found in the SEOP on page 
3, with a list of alternates on page 4 in case the need for succession arises. 

Emergency Operations Center 

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) must be activated upon the declaration of a State of 
Emergency by the Mayor. This center is required by the SEOP and serves as a nerve center for the 
Incident Management Team. Here, emergency relief efforts are coordinated by key members of the 
Incident Management Team. In this case, these relief efforts consist of the distribution of water filters at 



City Hall and community events, the distribution of bottled water throughout the city in conjunction 
with the efforts of community partners, and assisting with the circulation of water testing kits 
throughout the community. The EOC will also be monitoring and managing the inventory of relief 
supplies, such as water filters and bottled water. 

According to the SEOP, the EOC must establish an incident tracking system. This system will serve as a 
work plan for the management of the emergency. In addition, it is essential that the IMT record water 
testing results, lead water line location information, and information about the distribution of water 
filters and bottled water all in one place so that information is readily available for the Incident 
Management Team. This information will also be sent out to the public and media in the form of daily 
regular updates by the City's PIO. 

Communication 

The EOC maintains a telephone system that exists to intake questions about relief efforts and to 
organize relief logistics. It is open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. A voicemail system and 
eventual email system will exist to handle requests and inquiries that occur outside of the normal 
operating hours. This system will be constructed by the City's IS department. 

Public Awareness and Education 

1. Emergency Alerts and Updates: 

The City's Public Information Officer will make available information as it relates to the 
emergency in the form of press releases, emails, and physical documents. Daily updates 
containing information on the distribution of water filters, bottled water, water testing, blood 
lead testing, and other relief efforts will be available on the City's website for the public to view. 
Information will be available at City Hall for residents. 

2. Joint Information Center: 

The City's PIO will establish a joint Information Center that is organized to coordinate the efforts 
of multiple agencies to communicate with the public. This includes the circulation of joint press 
releases, public health information, educational materials, and updates relating to the State of 
Emergency. This committee is comprised of public information officers and public relations 
personnel to coordinate efforts to keep the public updated and informed. Regular updates to 
the media regarding events and progress will be made as news develops. 

The US EPA has offered assistance in the form of Public Information support. Additional support 
in this area has been provided by the Michigan State Police. 


3. Education: 

Many government agencies and philanthropic organizations are already distributing information 
regarding the effects of lead on public health. It is important that the City assist in these efforts 
so vital information and knowledge is presented to all members of the community. The goal is to 
continue to eliminate misunderstandings and incorrect information as it relates to reducing lead 
in drinking water, pursuing medical help, and maintaining a healthy diet to reduce lead 
absorption in the body. Lead education is currently being performed by the Genesee County 
Health Department, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Medical 
community at-large. 


Assessment of Social Needs 

In order to effectively and equitably provide immediate relief to Flint water customers, the City must 
take into account many of the socio-economic needs and limitations of the community. Some residents 
cannot get to City Hall for a water filter. Some residents do not have internet access. Literacy or a 
language barrier may also pose significant obstacles to the effective distribution of educational 
information and relief to those in need. These will be continuing challenges facing the community. At 
present these are the resources the City has available to mitigate some of those challenges. 

Logistics 


Logistics are being coordinated by the City Emergency Management Team's City's Chief Logistics Officer, 
who is the City Administrator. The CLO is responsible for the coordination, procurement, and 
transportation of goods and services, which is essential for effective implementation of the response 
plan. 

Fixed Distribution Points 

There are several locations throughout the city where residents may acquire a water filter. These 
locations are: 


Flint City Hall 

1101 South Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 

Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) 

601 North Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 
and 

2727 Lippencott Blvd, Flint Ml 48507 


Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 

4809 Clio Road, Flint Ml 48504 
and 

125 E. Union Street, Flint, Ml 48502 

Activation of Ward Distribution Centers 

Each of the nine wards will have activated distribution centers that are primarily managed by City 
Council Members or their designees.

Mobile Distribution Centers 

With the help of transportation agencies, like the Metro Transit Authority (MTA), meals on wheels, and 
GCCARD, the city can help establish mobile distribution centers and delivery systems that can provide 
water filters, bottled water, and nutritious foods, among other types of relief accompanied by 
educational materials to neighborhoods and to homes of people who experience limited mobility. 

• Mass Transportation Authority-MTA bus passes: Assisting residents with bus passes to 
improve their mobility will increase their chances of receiving help. Transportation 
services will also improve residents' access to medical care. 

• MTA-Your Ride mobile distribution: 

0 Estimated Costs: $25 per hour to deliver water and filters to homes throughout 
the City. 

Problem 1. Public Health Emergency 

The first objective in addressing this emergency is reducing, and eventually eliminating, the danger to 
public health. As City water coming out of faucets continue to contain lead, and copper and other 


































harmful contaminants exceeding government guidelines and regulations, it poses a risk to the people of 
our community. Preventative measures must be taken to avoid the effects of toxicosis that are difficult if 
not impossible to completely reverse. 

As far as preventative measures are concerned, education, water filters, and bottled water must be 
provided to every household in the City in order to reduce the chances of lead exposure, especially to 
our most vulnerable members of the community. If lead exposure has occurred, resulting in elevated 
blood lead levels, immediate and sustained medical attention must be available to those affected. 

Health services must be expanded in the area to accommodate increased numbers of case loads and 
specialized care regarding lead poisoning and its effects. 

Immediate Relief for Public Health: 

1. Prevention: Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing, and bottled 
water must be available to everyone. 

2. Access to nutritious food that reduces the risks of lead absorption by the body. The City can 
coordinate activities with the County Health Department 

Long Term Solutions: Maintaining Public Health and Coping with Lead Exposure 

1. Work closely with the Genesee County Health Department and Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services in order to provide sustainable care and monitoring of children exposed to 
lead. This care must be available for them for several years-preferably several decades. 

2. Support and education for primary care providers regarding aggressive long-term 
neurodevelopmental screening and testing. 

3. Improved access to developmental and behavioral (DBP) specialists, pediatric psychologists, 
pediatric psychiatrists. 

a. Pre-emptive referral to mental health/ toxic stress screenings. 

b. Support capacity building and or incentivize recruitment to allow Genesee health system 
(CMH) to build this capacity which is currently needed and lacking. 

4. Increase recognition and education regarding trauma informed care, social determinants of 
health (SDOH). 

5. Expand State funded Genesee Health System (CMH) services. 

a. Infant mental health (30 day capacity) 

b. Child case management 

c. Home based services 

d. Trauma informed care- trauma focused CBT 

Problem 2. Lead Contamination in the Water 
Immediate Relief: 


1. Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing for water customers, and 
bottled water must be available to everyone. Water filters can be obtained at any of the fixed 
distribution points throughout the City. 

2. Identification and verification of lead water service lines throughout the city- both public and 
private. 

3. Assistance to identify lead pipes within buildings and homes. 

Distribution of Bottled Water: 

At this point, we are directing all offers for donations to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan. It is 
imperative that water be accessible to all members of the community through a variety of distribution 
channels. These channels are explained in the Logistics Section of this plan. 

Distribution of Test Bottles: 

Water testing kits can be picked up at City Hall with instructions. Test results are posted on the City's 
website to raise public awareness and encourage more participation. 

Long term Solutions: Capital Improvements Needs 

The distribution of filters, water, and food to counter the effects of lead are essential response efforts to 
keep people safe. However, long term solutions are required to keep people healthy, to eliminate lead 
from the public and private water distribution system distribution, and to provide affordable clean 
water. Our public infrastructure and utilities must be reliable, sustainable, and equitable in order for this 
community to rebound after this emergency. The following long term solutions must be implemented in 
order to set the City of Flint on a course for recovery. These solutions come at a heavy cost for a City 
that is currently in receivership. The City has experienced financial distress due to this Emergency, in 
addition to a two million dollar loss from switching back to DWSD. The City has diligently applied for 
Fiscally Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships, Grant in order to supplement funding for capital 
improvement projects. It is essential that these grants be awarded in order to achieve long term 
solutions. 

1. COUPLETS Transition to a Temporary Safe Water Source until the Completion of KWA: 

This has already occurred. On October 16, 2015, Flint returned to receiving its water from DWSD 
on a 9 month agreement. This agreement will expire in June 2016, when the KWA is projected to 
be complete. The City had to pay $2 million out of its general fund to make this switch. 

2, UN PROGRESS Additional Corrosion Control added to the Water System: 



This is already occurring. In early December, 2015, Flint began to add additional corrosion 
control to the water coming in from DWSD in attempts to rebuild the protective scale inside its 
pipes. This is estimated to reduce lead levels in two to six months. 


3. Faucet Replacement: 

Replacement of Water faucets, and drinking fountains in the school system. It has been 
determined after state inspections that many sources of lead contamination in the School 
System's water were the faucets themselves. These faucets need to be replaced. 

4. Water Line Replacement: 

Water Line Replacement to reduce antiquated infrastructure and lead service lines. These lines 
must be identified, verified, and replaced. Residents who are facing financial hardships must 
have access to assistance to cover the costs of these replacements through access to grants and 
(forgivable) loans made available through State and Federal agencies. The corrosion damage to 
public and private lines that Flint River water caused is still being determined. 

• Replacement of an estimated fifteen thousand (15,000) lead service lines at an 

estimated cost of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per line. Total costs forty -five million 
dollars ($45,000,000). This project is estimated to be one of the most cost-intensive 
endeavors related to ameliorating water contaminants. 

5. Reimbursement of Critical Expenditures: 

Seeking reimbursement of two million dollar cost of returning to DWSD and forgiveness of 
Water Revolving Loan Debt from the State of Michigan. 


6. KWA Capital Improvements: The City has reconnected to Detroit temporarily until a water line 
from Port Huron is developed. The new water line known as the KWA pipeline or Karegnondi 
Water Authority is expected to bring water to the City from Lake Huron by July. The current cost 
agreement between Flint and DWSD is for nine months, therefore it is imperative that KWA be 
completed as soon as possible. Assistance relating to capital improvements to expedite this 
process will help to achieve long term goals. 


KWA Capital Improvements: 

a. Transfer Station to Dort Reservoir 

b. Raw water line to pump station #4 

c. Phosphoric acid feed system 

d. Alum Feed system 

e. Post filtration system

Ancillary Considerations: Public Safety during an Emergency 

During a time of emergency public safety agencies need to be prepared to respond to threats to public 
safety and critical infrastructure. The City is facing a man-made emergency that is threatening the public 
health. Resentment and hostility toward local institutions and municipal government is at a significant 
level. 

Critical infrastructure should be safeguarded if the need arises. This includes increasing security at City 
Hall to reduce potential for public safety risks. In the case of credible threats to public infrastructure, it 
may be required to hire private security company for first line of defense. Private Security is lower cost, 
thereby making it the first option. The minimum response is acted upon first, elevating only if the need 
arises. Credible or imminent threats of damage or destruction to critical infrastructure requires an 
elevated response. Such needs may require over-time police officers to address critical situations. 
Mutual aid from surrounding communities can be requested if Flint public safety is overextended. 

Implementation: 

Community Partners 

Financial limitations of the city persist while it confronts this emergency. Many community partners 
have offered their assistance to perform various needed functions. The city is heavily reliant on the 
assistance that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have provided. 

The Mott Foundation 

The Mott Foundation has provided financial assistance, especially in their generous contribution of $4 
million. In addition, the Mott Foundation has recently pledged an additional 

United Way 

The Genesee County United Way has provided significant financial assistance in the way of purchasing 
and helping to distribute water filters since the public health emergency began on October 1 st , 2015. 

Genesee County Community Action Resources Department (GCCARD) 


11 


GCCARD is organized to fight poverty and has been a primary partner in the distribution of water filters. 
It has also regularly supported the city with the logistics and availability of water filters at City Hall. 

Genesee County Health Department 

Has provided educational information to Flint Water customers 

Genesee County Board of Commissioners 

The Board of Commissioners have pledged their support to help Flint seek solutions to this crisis. The 
Board has already assisted in making health and nutrition information available to the public. 

Assistance from Wayne State University 

Wayne State University's Center for Urban Studies will be providing technical GIS support to assist in the 
documentation of emergency relief efforts. 

The US Environmental Protection Agency 

Region 5 EPA has offered assistance with Public Information distribution during the emergency. 

Outside Help is still needed... 

The City of Flint is forever thankful to our community partners who have given so much to help so many 
people. However the magnitude of this emergency calls for more resources that are beyond the capacity 
of the combined local organizations and government agencies. Long term solutions will require a heavy 
investment in health care and capital improvement projects to upgrade the city's antiquated water 
distribution system. 

• Help with Immediate Relief in terms of assuring allocative efficiency. Distribution should 
be equitable- assistance from other governments required to assure this. 

• Reaching communities for the distribution of water filters, water, and educational 
materials. 

• Help with Water Testing to increase participation and lead education. 

• Increasing the rate of water testing 

• Assistance is required to fund essential capital improvement projects to guarantee clean

You are spot on. Relax. I will manage this through. Colonel knows how I work. I will send you what I just 
gave Harvey privately. We listen to everyone... then we decide and expect them to support.

I offer a few' thoughts, and some of these may be incredibly naive, but we seem to be in a. brainstorming mode: 


■ Should we include MSHDA in the mix of departments involved in this? They administer the Community 

Development Block Grant program and this may call for some of that money. 

■ It might be prudent to reach out to Sen. Ananich, Rep. Neeley and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee to see if they would like 

representatives from their offices on any of these committees. 


l 


■ We still need to convey better the extent of the problem. So maybe this is a communications issue more than 

anything else, because I do know testing is going on. I don’t know HOW it’s going on, so I offer these 
suggestions, realizing they may already be happening or are totally unrealistic: 

The goal: Assess the extent of the elevated blood lead levels - the number of those affected and the degree to 
which they’re affected 

■ Get as many people in the affected zip codes tested as possible - can the Red Cross or some other agency with a 

bus or mobile unit set up for folks to give blood convert over to blood level testing and go into neighborhoods 
that have low testing rates? 

■ A public health friend of mine said that Genesee County Health workers are stressed to the max. Can we deploy 

appropriate personnel from other county health agencies to help with inspecting homes for possible other causes 
In other words, it won’t do any good to invest more in water infrastructure if we’re finding window sills with 
teeth marks. I say this NOT to downplay the role that water lead levels may have played. But can we get Habitat 
for Humanity, for example, to do a massive volunteer effort to eradicate lead paint in homes ... or is that 
beyond their expertise? 

■ Gather experts to assess exactly how extensive the problem is and potential causes. And then convey this in a 

much more accessible ways. If you want blood level data, you have to scroll down on the DHHS web site, find 
the headline and then read a long press release. Maybe we’re conveying this information better on the ground, 
but if not, we need to communicate conclusive findings in multiple ways- graphics, video, informational photo 
galleries and maybe even a “test” that residents can take to see if their home is at risk in other ways. I know that 
sounds awfully MLive-ish, but it can be effective.

Team: 


Today Harvey and I met with the Flint Water Task Force. It was a good meeting. People were pleased with the 
G’s statement from the prior day. Captain Kelenske joined us and we had a very good discussion about moving 
forward with the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency Coordinating Committee (FIACC). Tim Becker and 
Captain Kelenske provided me with a fair amount of input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for 
a State of Emergency which Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I have 
distilled all of this into a two page plan that I want your edits and comments on and a one page organizational 
chart (now presented in the “governor’s colors” according to our fine people in Communications). Spoiler 


2 



alert — I made Captain Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole shebang (with the Colonel’s blessing) so Harvey 
wouldn’t get lonely. 

Here is my ask of you: 

1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the Governor either New Year’s Day 
or Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday (Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the meeting January 7 along with 
financial resources that we still need some estimates on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change the narrative focus on 
Monday’s Genesee County declaration of emergency 

I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge period but I do appreciate 
everyone’s efforts and I know the Boss really does as well. 

Regards, 

Rich

The concern I have with having a local as a vice chair is that this is being pushed to the state level to 
fix. Similar to an emergency that reaches the state level, we need to have one lead to move this forward and 
that should be at the state level, I have run numerous state and federal disasters in this manner. The locals are 
pushing the request for resources to the state so this is them saying they cannot, do anything more and handing 
this off to the state. This is one of the areas I mentioned that needs to stay consistent with the Emergency 
Management Act and how we manage incidents. 


Locals still have a voice in this (one way is that they are generating the requests for resources to assist).

Increased funding/focus for Flead start to get ahead of the curve 

School nutrition and distribution systems (year around) 

Fresh produce/local foods 


Individual health screening 
Infrastructure improvements 


I know most if not all are identified in the outline but might want to further explain the nutrition component if 
the Docs in the group say it might be beneficial for those involved.

If you have any feedback, please provide it immediately, since I’ll be out of pocket starting at 3:15 p.m. (sorry

Director of Communications for Gov. Rick Snyder 


Office: 517-335-6397 


Mobile: | 

Twitter: @meholland 



DRAFT: A Proposal to Create the Flint Water Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Committee (FWIACC) 


Statement of Need 

To better coordinate resources and personnel and react with urgency, Harvey Hollins and MSP Capt. 
Chris Kelenske have been tasked with creating FWIACC, subject to the approval and endorsement by 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. 

We are also recommending, by executive order, that Gov. Rick Snyder authorizes this committee to help 
restore safe water in Flint and coordinate efforts addressing health/behavioral consequences from lead 
ingestion. 

This inter-agency group will fully engage with all stakeholders committed to solving Flint water issues. 
Equal partners. Equal leadership. Equal responsibility. Equal chance to be part of the solution to an 
important and not fully understood problem. 

FWIACC will be facilitated by Hollins and Kelenske, who represent statewide resources and 
constituencies, with support from senior members of the Governor's office. 

An overview of FWIACC's goals: 

• Create a routine information process between all parties. 

• Pursue other avenues of funding, including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• Implement without delay any appropriate mechanisms that are called for in the Emergency 
Management Act or the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. These may include 
local emergency operations plans and guides. 

Action Plan 

Immediately, FWIACC will: 

1 . Establish an interagency workgroup described in the attached organizational chart. It will be 
comprised of DHHS, MDEQ, MSP, Treasury, Genesee County, City of Flint, MDE, LARA and external 
subject matter experts (SMEs). Other entities may be added as needed. Personnel must be goal- 
oriented, transparent with findings, and able to accomplish FWIACC Incident Action Plan items 
created by the state in a timely manner. The FWIACC plan would be created with city, county, state 
and federal needs in mind. 

2. Assemble staff with competencies in disaster/emergency planning, operations and finance as 
outlined under the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Staff will be accountable to the 
FWIACC leadership to track resource requests and document progress on the FWIACC incident 
action plan. 

3. Utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as appropriate. 

4. Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive and legislative levels as 
determined appropriate. 

5. Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 



Interagency Workgroup Objectives 


1 . Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 

■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to all stakeholders and interested parties. 

■ Create logistics for distributing water and filters, particularly to homebound citizens. 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods, nutrition education and protocols for monitoring, 
neurodevelopmental screening, access to DBP specialists and 
psychologists/psychiatrists, expanded county services, etc. 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community. 

■ Identify existing public information outlets within the city, county and state, 
including schools, churches and other formal and informal distribution networks. 

■ Establish a Joint Information Center. 

■ Provide for emergency alerts and updates. 

■ Determine the process for approving official information before it's disseminated. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water 
system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 

■ Develop priorities, costs and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades 
as part of a long term recovery plan. 

■ Seek partners to assist (NGOs, Foundations, Business, etc.). 

■ Implement the plan. 











January 3, 2016 


To: Mayor Karen Weaver 
From: Harvey Hollins 

Governor Snyder and several members of his team do not believe we can wait for the necessary 
documentation for FEMA to act on any emergency declaration - and that an action plan should be fired 
up now by our State and Local entities and bring together agencies and stakeholders that need to 
communicate and coordinate more effectively regarding next steps and resources. 

Our working draft title is the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee (FWIACC), and it would 
immediately address ways at every level to restore safe water and monitor/mitigate the effects of the 
lead. 

In addition to Governor Snyder, the key officials working on this blueprint were MSP Capt. Chris 
Kelenske, DHHS Chief Deputy Tim Becker, DHHS Director Nick Lyon, Rich Baird and myself. The need for 
engaged central coordination has also been recommended by the Governor's Flint Water After-Action 
Task Force, of which Dr. Larry Reynolds is a member. Governor Snyder has endorsed this approach and 
has asked me to provide you with a draft copy in advance of your meeting with him on January 7. If you 
agree, we will organize this committee immediately, and the Governor will issue an executive order to 
authorize FWIACC to work on the issue for the long term . 

As you know, there is a significant amount of work to be done before the Federal government will 
approve an emergency declaration under the Emergency Management Act. FWIACC could begin its 
work immediately and would be in place to complement, not replace any action group ultimately 
formed by an emergency declaration. And we believe it would demonstrate how to best leverage 
essential support addressing manmade emergencies like this, since existing laws are more oriented 
toward natural disasters. 

We brainstormed who should be included in this initial emergency response, with the idea that you and 
other stakeholders may have recommendations on others who need to be added. 

You will note the organization chart and the proposal description is not a normal hierarchical entity. 

This is a collaborative, stakeholder-driven partnership. Chris and I would facilitate it, but it is a 
partnership of city, county and state viewpoints, and would include outside experts like Marc Edwards 
and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. 

All parties will be required to be transparent about their ideas and findings, agreeing to accountability 
measures and reporting on them on a regular basis. 

Please let me know your thoughts on this approach and also other agenda items you wish to see on 
January 7. If you agree, we would also invite the interim DEQ director, Keith Creagh, and the newly 
appointed spokesperson to meet you then.

Subject: FYI- Release going shortly re: Flint Emergency Declaration 

Good afternoon, 

Just wanted you all to know that we're issuing the following press release shortly regarding the Governor declaring an 
emergency in Genesee County and activating the State Emergency Operations Center. The declaration will be attached 
with it. 

Thanks! 

Gov. Snyder declares emergency for Genesee County 

State Emergency Operations Center activated to assist with relief efforts 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today declared a state of emergency for Genesee County 
due to the ongoing health and safety issues caused by lead in the city of Flint’s drinking water. 

By declaring a state of emergency, Snyder has made available all state resources in cooperation 
with local response and recovery operations. The declaration authorizes the Michigan State 
Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division (MSP/EMHSD) to coordinate 
state efforts. 

“The health and welfare of Flint residents is a top priority and we’re committed to a coordinated 
approach with resources from state agencies to address all aspects of this situation,” Snyder said. 
“Working in full partnership with the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, all levels of government and 
water quality experts, we will find both short-term and long-term solutions to ensure the health and 
safety of Flint residents.” 

In addition to the emergency declaration, Snyder activated the State Emergency Operations 
Center to coordinate state response and recovery activities. State agencies will report to the 
center to coordinate resources, assess the situation and begin providing assets to assist with local 
relief operations. 

“Our staff recognizes the urgency of this situation and is already working closely with local 
officials,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, Deputy State Director of Emergency Management and 


i 



Homeland Security and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. “We will continue to collaborate with 
state, city and county leaders to coordinate relief efforts, streamline communication and use all 
available resources to help residents.” 

On Jan. 4, Genesee County declared a “local state of emergency,” which activated local 
emergency response and recovery plans. By requesting a governor’s declaration, the county has 
determined local resources are insufficient to address the situation and state assistance is 
required to protect public health, safety and property to lessen or avert the threat of a crisis. 

The city of Flint has been under a local emergency declaration since Dec. 14, 2015. 

The SEOC is the emergency operations center for the state of Michigan. Located in Lansing, the 
center is overseen by the MSP/EMHSD and coordinates response and recovery efforts by state 
agencies and local government. The SEOC is staffed by members of state agencies and other 
partners for decision making and information coordination during disasters or emergencies in the 
state of Michigan.

This is how am planning to respond to any media inquiries on this Setter, which is just a couple so far: 

We look forward to continuing work with Congressman Kildee and other officials and stakeholders at the federal, state 
and local levels to bring ideas and resources to bear to ensure public health in Flint and clean, safe drinking water. And 
again, we have the multiple step action plan as well as the independent, bipartisan task force work underway.

Subject: RE: request for comment on congressman's letter 

I do not believe we should respond to this over the top letter for both legal and philosophical reasons. Responding to 
this just feeds his narrative. How about we not issue a letter in response? Here's my issues: 

1. First paragraph, top of second page, "...additional steps that need to be taken to remediate the damage done 
to the people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of Flint's 
Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available." Ail of these emotionally charged and essentially 
unfounded accusations suggest the state's culpability in levying damages to "the people of Flint". There are 
definitely people in Flint (mostly poor and without many resources but also many other people) struggling with 
an old system, brown water, lead and unsavory health problems that have been put through several months of 
alarm and struggle, but let's try to deal with human beings and not political bombast Let's identify and solve 
problems. Literally hundreds of state employees have worked night and day to resolve these Issues. Are we 

l 




going to blame state employees indiscriminately when our people were simply trying to do their jobs to the best 
of their ability and were unable to anticipate (for whatever reason) all the consequences? 

2. First bullet point, "...and other state resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair damage 
done...". Sorry, but we're not going to commit the general fund to repair "...Flint's water distribution 
system." What does that mean? And if we sign on to that then where does it stop and what repairs? 

3. Second paragraph, "...hundreds of millions of dollars of damage....". Where did this come from? I take it the 
Congressman is now a self-appointed expert on water systems and their cost? 

4. Second bullet, "...the state create a fund for ongoing assistance...." We already have several funds to deal with 
lead exposure and we have multiple programs, WIC. Medicaid, health endowment, etc. to assist people in 
need. Why would we create another fund? 

5. Third paragraph, "...need for significant investments in the local health system in order to respond....". We 
already make significant investments in the local system. They were able to identify the danger early and I 
would assume they will be significant players in the future. Additionally, DHHS has a myriad of programs already 
in place to assist the local health system, which I don't need to remind everyone is a city owned hospital and for 
whatever reason never consulted by the city when the KWA conversion was being studied and proposed. That 
system also never objected nor tested the Flint River before, even though the river was always the city's source 
backup. Even the proposal prior to the state's involvement considered using two million gallons of Flint River 
water and that was a public record. But, that's another issue best left to another time. 

6. Third bullet, "...rescind Flint's obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting....". The state gave the 
city $2.1 million to help the water system during the summer, and part of the agreement to get the $5 million 
from the legislature for the emergency was contingent on Flint contributing a share. 

7. Fourth paragraph. " ..for the state's failures is an abdication of clear responsibility.,..". First of all, it's not a 
state's failures, it is a perhaps avoidable mistake made with the corrosives that was unacceptable to us, the 
Director and Governor are taking actions to fix the problems, the health and wellness of the people of Flint is 
our absolute concern, and it's not an abdication of dear responsibility. The "...state-appointed emergency 
manager was in charge..." may well be accurate for the physical change, but the decision to leave the Detroit 
system was made when the city, the Mayor, the council, the county, local leaders and the KWA was devised and 
that was well before the physical change. 

For these reasons and others, I'd prefer Sara's general assistance and aid comments and not responding to the letter.

That's what I suggested; however after given it second thought, I think a simple reply should go something like:

and I will be more than happy to send you their findings to you."

i 



Today about 98% of water treatment facilities in the U.S. use some form of chlorine to disinfect 
drinking water supplies. It is a cost effective method for destroying potentially harmful bacteria 
and viruses. However, chlorine’s ability to interact with organic compounds in water leads to 
trihalomethanes (THMs) formation. Especially, river or lake water with high level of organic 
matter require heavy chlorination to combat high level of bacteria, resulting in dangerous levels 
of THMs and bad smell. THMs, when ingested can encourage the growth of free radicals that 
can destroy or damage vital cells in the body. Besides cancer, exposure to THMs has been 
linked to other health issues including asthma, eczema, heart disease and higher miscarriage 
and birth defect rates. Further, high level of chlorine also poses serious risk to the aging 
infrastructure. 

Chemical free water disinfection technologies such as UV light and ozone have long been 
recognized to be much safer than chlorination, however, their high cost has prevented wider 
adoption. The basic mechanism of ozone 
generation and disinfection is shown in 
the picture. Ozone has a high oxidation 
potential (much higher than chlorine) and 
a superior response time compared to 
other sanitizing products. Its high 
oxidizing potential enables ozone to break 
down organic matters that chlorine 
cannot. Some pollutants can only be 
oxidized by ozone. For example, Cryptosporidium Parvum, a drinking water pollutant, is 
resistant to most disinfectants, but is effectively destroyed by ozone. Most importantly, the 
emission from ozone is pure oxygen and it leaves no residues. 

UV light is a competing non-chemical sterilization technique. Intense UV rays break down the 
sensitive RNA and/or DNA of microorganisms, thus preventing the organism from reproducing. 
Ozone, on the other hand, oxidizes the microorganisms, thus destroying their cells completely. 
UV sterilization being a line of sight process, to be effective, one needs to remove most of the 
suspended matter prior to the treatment. In contrast, ozone oxidizes the soil or particulate 
matter, changing or destroying the chemistry of the soiling materials such as organic 
compounds. 

Despite the great benefits of ozone, its widespread adoption is limited due to the high total 
ownership cost of current commercial ozone generators. Somnio’s AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator is 
a paradigm shift in ozone generation technology. The first and only commercial barrier less 
ozone generator eliminates the requirement of dielectric barriers and highly filtered dried oxygen 
(pure or enriched) supplies, which restrain current commercial ozone generators. This 
groundbreaking technology brings a market-competitive, robust, energy efficient, and scalable 
modular device that offers a financially attractive alternative with the capability of producing 
varying levels of ozone depending on the application at hand. 

Producing ozone cost effectively is only part of the greater story of the far reaching benefits of 
ozone. Applying ozone effectively for a given application requires careful and intelligent design, 
sensing and monitoring. In addition to its revolutionary AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator, Somnio 


Gas Discharge 



collaborates with end users to provide complete and economical turnkey solutions. Somnio’s 
current in-house test plant incorporates all necessary safety features and automation.

Wayne and I discussed this further, i think it would be good if this group could meet early next week to have another 
discussion on Flint. 

The purpose of the meeting would be to discuss and finalize Flint RTAB members, and also to discuss the potential 
ramifications of Rep. Kildee's recommendation that the state forgive Flint's $22.M water loan: 
http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/04/kiidee asks feds about forgive.html 

If you agree, perhaps Wendy (or Laura, in her absence) and Beth can help us find some time. Thanks much.

It is timely to figure that out, because what they is not affordable and they are ignoring the new improvements 
announced today.

Emergency Management after 2011 








Remaining Challenges: 



• The transition to KWA and maintenance of the aging water distribution infrastructure are important 
challenges which require significant funding and continued leadership 



In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc. 
(TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & Sewer 
Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The purpose of this 
study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) in 
order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the City of 
Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, options presented were: 1) Flint Water 
Plant will provide 100% water, 2) 100% provision of untreated Lake Fluron Water by KWA, 3) 100% provision of 
treated drinking water by DWSD, or 4) provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination 
of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 


The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA, deciding later to join KWA. 


On April 25, Flint officially ended nearly 50-years of using DWSD to supply water. 

The city currently uses the Flint River until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is built, which will bring 
untreated Lake Fluron water to Genesee County. KWA should be operational by winter 2016. 

The Flint River water is harder than DWSD. A number of residents are experiencing discoloration and order with 
the water. In addition there have been a number of citations largely around heightened levels of Total 
Trihalomethanes (TTHM). 


2 






Given water quality concerns, suggestions have been made that the City of Flint should return to using water 
purchased through the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). For many reasons, financial and 
otherwise, the City of Flint can ill-afford to switch courses at this point. The estimated cost to go back to the 
water provided by the DWSD is approximately $1 million per month and the City expects to be using the 
Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) Lake Huron water within or before the 1 st quarter of 2016. 

The City of Flint is proceeding with a series of actions to ensure the continued safety of Flint drinking water is 
maintained and that issues of discoloration and odor continue to be addressed. Most notably, the installation of 
a Granulated Active Charcoal filter (GAC) at the Water Treatment Plant is expected to be authorized this week 
by Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. 

The introduction of the GAC to the treatment process at Flint's plant will absorb or reduce the chemical 
precursors which will block or eliminate the formation of TTHM during the filtration process. Engineering and 
design are underway and installation of the GAC is targeted for completion by mid-July. Cost of this 
improvement is projected at $1.5 million and will be paid for by the proceeds from the state approved 
restructuring of the City's Drinking Water Revolving Fund loans. 

In addition to the installation of the GAC, the City of Flint is undertaking a number of other improvements to the 
water system in the coming months, including a water leak detection monitoring, completion of the hydraulic 
model and subsequent targeted hydrant flushing program, and the replacement of two miles of water main pipe 
in a critical area of the city. All of these improvements scheduled to occur within the next six months.

Harvey - 


We are all set. serve as liaison on this one. The merchant team 

can source 1,500 filters. We will get them to the community at cost. My guess is 
this will be $20k or so, but the team will give you a final number. 


Because we don't want to be a state vendor, we won't sell them to you. ^^^|will 
work out logistics of whether we make a donation of gift cards to the state that 
you use to purchase them, or whether there is some other entity to which we can 
give them. 


Given all the circumstances, we are not inte rested in any publicity. We want it to 
be clear that the state is providing these, not I

Per our last conversation, I expressed that we were interested acquiring and 
distributing 1500 water filters to Flint residents to assist with the quality 
(perceived or real) of their drinking water until the KWA pipeline comes online. 


A few weeks ago, you asked me to send you the product ID number so you could 
check with your suppliers regarding price. I apologize for taking long to send you 
product ID; a number of conversations needed to occur in Flint before we could 
proceed. 


The product ID for a Brita Filter for kitchen faucets is: 
Product ID 3176421 
UPC 7-23987-0078

Harvey - 


We are all set. can serve as liaison on this one. The 

merchant team can source 1,500 filters. We will get them to the 
community at cost. My guess is this will be $20k or so, but the 
team will give you a final number. 


Beca use we d on't want to be a state vendor, we won't sell them to 
you. ^J^vill work out logistics of whether we make a donation 
of gift cards to the state that you use to purchase them, or whether 
there is some other entity to which we can give them. 


Given all the circumstances, we are not interested in any 
publicity. We want it to be clear that the state is providing these, 



Thanks for reaching out.

Per our last conversation, I expressed that we were interested 
acquiring and distributing 1500 water filters to Flint residents to 
assist with the quality (perceived or real) of their drinking water 
until the KWA pipeline comes online. 


A few weeks ago, you asked me to send you the product ID 
number so you could check with your suppliers regarding price. I 
apologize for taking long to send you product ID; a number of 
conversations needed to occur in Flint before we could proceed. 


The product ID for a Brita Filter for kitchen faucets is: 
Product ID 3176421 
UPC 7-23987-0078

RE: Water Filter 


Thank you, the quick response. Harvey does have an additional question. Is the plan for 

the state to purchase the filters or is donating them? The former is fine and the 

latter is great. If we purchase them we have to determine the process. If they are donated, I will 
identify the location in Flint where they will be shipped.

Subject: Water Filter 



Per our last 
conversation, I 
expressed that we 
were interested 
acquiring and 
distributing 1500 
water filters to Flint 
residents to assist 
with the quality 
(perceived or real) of 
their drinking water 
until the KWA 
pipeline comes 
online. 


A few weeks ago, you 
asked me to send you 
the product ID 
number so you could 
check with your 
suppliers regarding 
price. I apologize for 
taking long to send 
you product ID; a 
number of 

conversations needed 
to occur in Flint 
before we could 
proceed. 


The product ID for a 
Brita Filter for 
kitchen faucets is: 

Product ID 3176421 

UPC 7-23987-0078

Thank you for taking 
the time to look into 
this. 


Best, 

Harvey Hollins III, 
Director 

Governor’s Office of 
Urban Initiatives

Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 
Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 







Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to 
eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality is 
continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for 
Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Selected Key Project Experience 

For the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division Eric Rothstein has served 
as an independent utility advisor for mediation related to the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority 
(GLWA). Following execution of a Memorandum of Understanding and Articles of Incorporation by the 
Incorporating Municipalities (City of Detroit, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties, and the State of Michigan), 
Mr. Rothstein was appointed to serve as Implementation Planning Program Manager for the standup of the 
GLWA - a regional utility serving approximately 40% of the population of the State of Michigan. 

For Water Replenishment District of Southern California, Eric Rothstein was engaged to provide an expert 
report related to the consistency of the District’s rate setting requirements with industry-standard practices 
contemplating proportionate distribution of cost responsibilities based on cost causation. These practices are 
consistent with prescripts of State of California law. 

For Jefferson County, Alabama, Eric Rothstein has served as the County’s rate consultant since 2010. He 
has reviewed cost-of service analyses and alternative rate proposals to address the County’s outstanding sewer 
warrant obligations, developed revisions to its sewer rates approved in November 2012, and again in 
September 2013, and is leading strategic financial planning related to the County’s bankruptcy Plan of 
Adjustment. Mr. Rothstein has been deposed and provided expert witness testimony in various court 
proceedings stemming from the County’s declaration of bankruptcy in 2011, and has led development of a 
Municipal Advisor Report related to a planned Series 2013 Sewer Warrant issue to effectuate the County’s exit 
from bankruptcy. 

For the Halifax Regional Water Commission, Eric Rothstein led development of a Cost of Service and Rate 
Design report to the Nova Scotia Utility and Accounting Review Board (NSUARB Docket No. NSUARB-W- 



HRWC-R-11), in response to the Board’s Order and Decision to hold separate hearings to determine 
appropriate ratemaking methodologies for Canada’s first regulated water, wastewater and stormwater utility. 
Eric led preparation of the report and the development of cost allocation and rate design models to illustrate the 
implications of alternative methodological approaches. Eric supported development of HRWC’s subsequent 
application for water, wastewater and stormwater rates filed with the NSUARB in December 2012 and provided 
expert witness testimony in support thereof in April 2012. In April 2014, Eric prepared a HRWC Cost Shares for 
Use of the Angus L, Macdonald Bridge and provided expert witness testimony in M06127 - Halifax-Dartmouth 
Bridge Commission/Halifax Regional Water Commission: Waterline on the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge - HDBC- 
G-14 

For the City of Atlanta, since 2004, Mr. Rothstein has served as the Department of Watershed Management’s 
primary coordinator for its revenue bond issues used to finance its $3 billion wastewater Consent Decree 
program. This has included issues in 2004, 2008, 2009 (2), 2013 and 2015 and, in 2006, implementation of its 
Tax-Exempt Commercial Paper program with a shelf registration of $1.2 billion. Mr. Rothstein led development 
of the Department’s Financial Capability Based Schedule Extension Request Report used to secure the City’s 
13-year extension of its wastewater Consent Decree schedule. Fie prepared each of the Department’s Financial 
Capability Assessment filings. Fie has led the development and updating of strategic financial planning tools for 
water and sewer rate development and policy-level consideration of overall program financing strategies (as 
well as detailed project expenditure, status, and schedule tracking). 

For the Egyptian Ministry of Housing, through a USAID contract, Mr. Rothstein developed guidance on tariff 
setting, capital project prioritization, and strategic planning for the newly established water and wastewater 
sector regulatory agency. The project involved the development of a guidance manual, detailed financial 
planning and cost-of-service analysis modeling, and testing of financial analysis and prioritization tools with four 
major Egyptian utilities. Mr. Rothstein has also provided presentations on financial planning and strategic 
planning principles to USAID staff and Technical Assistance contractors. 

For the Milwaukee Wholesale Customers, through sub-contracts with SHEH, Inc., Mr. Rothstein reviewed the 
Milwaukee Water Works rate increase applications filed in 2010 and 2014, reviewed pre-filed testimony, and 
offered expert witness testimony related to revenue requirements and appropriate rates of return at hearings 
before the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. 

For several wastewater permittees facing Consent Decrees including the City of Akron, East Bay Municipal 
Utility District, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, Metropolitan Sewer District of St. Louis, and the 
City and County of Honolulu, Mr, Rothstein has assisted in the conduct of financial capability assessments 
per EPA prescribed methodologies and in the development of alternative approaches to assessment that more 
appropriately reflect utility capital financing options. These efforts have been used in the formulation of 
negotiation positions related to the scope and schedule of potential Consent Decree provisions. Mr. Rothstein 
is currently engaged with the City of Peoria, IL and with the Guam Waterworks Authority, in similar Consent 
Decree negotiations. 

For the National Association of Clean-Water Agencies, Mr. Rothstein has served as Principal Author for the 
development of several of the association's white papers and publications related to Financial Capability 
Assessments used to develop wastewater Consent Decree schedules. These publications include NACWA’s 
Financial Capability and Affordability in Wet Weather Negotiations (2007), and The Evolving Landscape for 
Financial Capability Assessment: Clean Water Act Negotiations and the Opportunities of Integrated Planning 
(2013). These papers provide critical reviews of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) 
established policies and guidance on financial capability assessments for wet weather programs and offers 
practical guidance for negotiations on enforcement policies and practices related to consideration of financial 
capability. 



For the City of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Mr, Rothstein served as Project Manager for a comprehensive cost-of- 
service rate studies for the City’s water, wastewater and stormwater systems conducted in 1997 and 2012, In 
1997, the consulting team facilitated decision-making through an extensive public involvement process that 
featured monthly meetings of a Citizen’s Advisory Committee comprised of a diverse set of stakeholder 
representatives, For both studies, detailed cost allocation analyses were conducted and customized computer 
rate analysis models developed to facilitate rate updating for budgetary changes, revision to cost allocations, 
and rate design modifications. 

For Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia, Mr, Rothstein has provided strategic financial planning, bond 
feasibility and comprehensive cost-of-service rate assistance since 2000. Strategic financial planning facilitated 
the City’s adoption of a seven-year, 11 percent per annum rate increase schedule to support infrastructure re- 
investment in excess of $400 million. Mr, Rothstein managed 3 bond feasibility studies over the course of the 
program implementation, helping the County to secure strong credit ratings and favorable financing. A cost-of- 
service study in 2004 involved special queries of a new billing system for development of user characteristic 
data and consideration of specific cost assignments for previously unsewered portions of the County’s 
wastewater system. 

Previous to his work as a utility management consultant, Mr. Rothstein served in several financial management 
positions for the City of Austin, Texas. In this capacity, he directed staffs of up to 22 members in utility 
ratemaking, evaluation of regionalization alternatives and proposed utility investments, analysis of capital 
financing options, internal control evaluation, and revenue forecasting.

Re: Flint After Action Meeting 

Date: October 20, 2015 


Governor, 

Attached is a draft press release to be reviewed with the after action team tomorrow morning. 

In addition, Rich & Flarvey are vetting & reaching out to potential Flint resident to join the task force: 

1) Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, MD of Mott Children's Hospital, long standing and respected member of the Flint community, 
speaks his mind and very professional. 


Rich will invite him to the meeting tomorrow by phone or in person. 

Attached are resumes for Kolb, Dr. Davis, and Eric Rothstein. 

Draft Agenda: 

1) Introductions 

2) Mission of Task Force 

3) Background Info 

4) Discussion of Timeline 

5) Q & A from Task Force Members 

6) Communications Strategy/Review Press Release 

Suggested Goals for Task Force: 

1) Thorough review of all steps taken in Flint regarding switch to Flint River and back GLWA. 

a. Create Timeline of actions 

b. Establish why each action was taken 

2) Review of role of Feds, EM, State, City Council, and Mayor in process. 

a. Establish best practices for Feds, State, Local, and EM to work together in future situations 

b. Indicate where coordination could have been and should be improved 

3) Review of DEO. & DHHS actions & protocols 

a. Did DEO. & DHHS follow the proper procedures? 

b. Do the procedures need to change? 

4) Provide guidance for switch back to GWLA 

a. Ensure proper corrosion controls & testing is in place 

b. Highlight steps for eventual switch to Karegnondi 

5) Testing Beyond Flint 

a. What practices need to change in communities outside of Flint? 

b. What change in law is recommended to ensure all Michiganders are drinking clean water? 

Suggested Timeline: 

The task force members have indicated that 2 months is the earliest possible time to properly conduct a full after action 
report. In reality, they suggest 3 months is more feasible. Given the holidays, a 2 month timeline puts us roughly right

Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 
Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 







Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to 
eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality is 
continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for 
Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

continue buying water from Detroit and two days after Detroit gave Flint a notice of termination of its 
1965 water contract.

The city of Detroit has given notice that it’s terminating a nearly 50-year-old contract for selling water 
to Flint and the county next. year. 


July 23 rd Flint River now an option for drinking water following Detroit's termination of 
contract 


The Flint River was not a viable option to provide drinking water to city residents when the water 
relationship between Flint and Detroit was stable. But river water might be used temporarily as the 
city's water supply now that Flint signed an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority and will 
get up to 18 million gallons per day of raw 'water in 2016 from Lake Huron. The Flint River hadn't 
been an option, city officials previously said, because upgrades to Flint's water plant would be too 
expensive, the river didn't provide enough capacity to serve Flint, residents' water needs and the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality would not allow it.

expensive, the river didn't provide enough capacity to serve Flint residents' water needs and the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality would not allow it.

Resolution: 


130165.2 

Presented: 3 - 11-13 

Adopted: 3 - 25-13 


AMENDED RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY 
FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


BY THE MAYOR: 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

The City of Flint has decided that it is in its long term best interests to enter into a 
contract with the KWA to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from 
the Flint River. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from the Flint River. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, with approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

Subject: DRAFT task force response letter 

Good evening team, 

Here is a draft response to the task force letter that I think covers the needed ground and designates 
Harvey for the role suggested by the task force members. Please let me know if we are missing anything, 
or if there are points you want me to make, realizing that this letter will be distributed to the public. 

Thank you for your assistance. 

Dave 


Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 

Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote 
public health and protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and 
appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they 
relate to reducing lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is 
more work that must be done to ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of 
Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health 
Department, local schools, and our partners in the non-profit community. 

These partners are making progress, and we know we can always strive to improve practices and 
communication for continual improvement. 


l 



You make a solid suggestion about establishing a person who is independent of any one of the involved 
state agencies or organizations to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am 
recommending that Harvey Hollins, director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. 
Harvey is well-versed in the issue and the challenges faced by our cities and will be effective in this role. 

I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more 
accessible to the Flint community. It's important that people have confidence that we are working to 
address any problems and will take the necessary actions to improve interaction among city, state and 
federal agencies. 

People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the 
water coming out of their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - 
at all levels - is working effectively to protect them. 

I thank you again for lending your time and expertise to this vitally important effort. 

Regards,

DATE 

COMPLETED 

Filter Distribution 

Residents may continue to obtain filters from Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department (GCCARD) (both sites 9-4PM) and MDHHS clients can continue to obtain filters 
at the two MDHHS office locations or the GCCARD sites. 

Since 10/6, 11,355 
MDHHS purchased 
water filters and 
200 water pitchers 
have been 
distributed. 

Ongoing 

Filter Replacement 
Distribution 

The procedure is in place for replacement cartridge distribution including an abbreviated 
application for residents to apply for and obtain cartridge replacement. 

Cartridge replacement will occur at same locations as filter sites. 

DHHS is also placing an order for 750 replacement filters for the 8-cup Zerowater filters. 
9000 Brita replacement filters on hand with an additional 10,000 readily available when 
needed. Total available= 19,000 

1,418 MDHHS 
purchased 
replacement water 
filters have been 
distributed. 

Ongoing 


MDHHS is currently coordinating with GCCARD on publicity for distribution of the 
replacement filters. United Way will provide Pur Filter Replacements. 

United Way will also be purchasing filter units for school water fountains. 

Press release planned Monday 11/2 re: pick up of replacement filters, videos to be posted 
on websites and you tube. 

Jen Eisner will 
work with Hilda 
McShane 

Completed 11/2 


United Way requested that MDHHS purchase Pur filter replacements. GCCARD requests 
that no more bottled water be donated. They have plenty in stock. Cash is preferred. 
City of Flint set up distribution point in City Administration office building. Genesee 
County Health Department (GCHD) will be providing City of Flint with Pur Filters. The 
Brita filter requires a form for MDHHS be filled out; there are some concerns that 
undocumented members of population will avoid Brita filters for this reason. 

No action 
indicated. 


Public Education 
Proper Filter Use 

When used improperly, the filters will exceed their capacity limit in a much shorter time 
frame thereby increasing need for filter replacement much sooner than expected. 
Develop NEW public education material about proper use of cartridge AND how to obtain 
filter replacement cartridges, targeted for release week of October 26 during lead 
awareness week.

14 schools. Residential testing will have a different protocol. GCHD has been in contact 
with DEQto possibly assist in sampling. 

Linda Dykema has a draft Executive Summary for Health-Based Drinking Water Lead Levels 
developed. Once testing is completed, this document will serve as a decision guide on 
reopening of school and/or daycare water fountains/faucets for student use. Linda will 
revise the model to include paint chip values/risk levels. GCHD sanitarians are assisting DEQ 
with water sampling. We should anticipate some differences in opinion on actionable pb 
levels. 

Suggested that the following language that DC used be adapted for our use: "The removal 
of lead in drinking water is most effective if the full lead service line is removed from both 
the public and private property. If you choose not to replace your private side pipe, lead 
can continue to dissolve in your drinking water. You should also replace galvanized 
plumbing, older lead soldered pipes, and brass fixtures and use a different plumbing 
material in your home. Until all potential sources of lead in drinking water are removed 
from your private property, be sure to follow the flushing and filter instructions provided." 

"Water is lead-free when it leaves the treatment plant, but lead can be released when the 
water comes in contact with pipes and plumbing fixtures that contain lead. Lead sources 
and lead levels vary between buildings, so it is important to identify and remove any lead 
sources in each household." 

"Pregnant or nursing women and children under age six should use filtered tap water for 
drinking water and cooking until all lead sources are removed. Filters certified for lead 
removal are required to meet National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) Standard 53." 

This language will be incorporated into EBL investigation reports and in the educational 

indicated,

DEQ gave permission to increase phosphate levels in the water temporarily. Some health 
concerns might be raised about this particularly for infants. Dr. Eden Wells said that it is 
unlikely to cause health problems but we can add information on the FAQ to help reassure

BUREAU OF EMS, TRAUMA AND PREPAREDNESS 


Considerations for Use of the Incident Command System (ICS) for the 
Flint Lead Contamination Incident 
November 24, 2015 


Basic ICS tenets: 

• Activation of Incident Command System (ICS) is determined by the scope and magnitude of an incident. 

• Commonalities in all incidents include acute harm to the environment, infrastructure or populace by an agent 
such as biological, toxin/poisons, or natural causes (severe weather is most common). 

• The first step is determining the scope & magnitude of the incident with a preliminary assessment. This 
assessment determines if ICS is appropriate for the response and what the response should be for the mitigation 
or containment of the causative agent to minimize negative effects on the environment or public. 

• Following the initial acute response phase, there is both short term and long term recovery. In this situation, 
this could include identification of exposed children, lead testing & treatment if appropriate and monitoring of 
that vulnerable population for negative health consequences in subsequent years. 

Unified Command: 

• This is the ICS method of best efficacy for incidents involving multiple jurisdictions or agencies. 

• Enables institutions and agencies with different legal, geographic, and functional responsibilities to coordinate, 
plan, and interact effectively. 

• The Incident Commanders within the Unified Command make joint decisions and speak as one voice. Any 
differences are worked out within the Unified Command. Unity of command is maintained. Each responder 
reports to a single supervisor within his or her area of expertise. 

• An example of a Unified Command incident in Michigan is the response to the Enbridge Oil Spill. The 
command structure included federal, state and local staffing. 

• Benefits of a unified approach are: 

o A shared understanding of priorities and restrictions. 

o A single set of incident objectives, planning process and incident action plan, 
o Collaborative strategies. 

o Improved internal and external information flow, 
o Less duplication of efforts, 
o Better resource utilization. 

In Michigan, Emergency Management (EM) has ICS command & control of an incident. This is true whether it is local 
emergency management isolated to one jurisdiction or the MSP Emergency Management and Homeland Security 
Division for a multi-jurisdictional (3 or more) incident. Most emergencies occur first locally and therefore are under 
the authority of the local EM and county administration to determine the scope of the incident for utilization of the ICS 
structure and/or request assistance from the state. All other agencies, health, environmental, & agriculture, etc. are 
supporting agencies to the EM command and therefore coordinate their own resources for response. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Community Health Emergency Coordination 
Center (CHECC) functions within the Multiagency Coordination System (MACS) of the National Incident 
Management System (NIMS). The CHECC provides coordination and support for the command structure but does not 
function in a command role. Multiagency coordination is a process that allows different disciplines to work together 
more effectively. For the CHECC it includes essentially all of public health & healthcare (human services under 
development). 

The primary benefits of the CHECC are during response for coordination of department resources to: 



• Establish and clarify policy with the Executive Group. 

• Perform a situational assessment 

• Establish a health common operating picture. 

• Set state level public health & healthcare priorities. 

• Facilitate logistics support and resource allocation. 

• Interagency activities. 

• Synchronize health messaging to ensure that we are speaking with one voice. 

Long Term Recovery Planning: 

The Flint lead contamination incident is now in response including short term recovery and rapidly transitioning 
towards long term recovery. Long term recovery could entail community public works redevelopment and 
revitalization. It presents opportunities to restructure the community and simultaneously making it more resilient with 
determination of lead-vulnerable pediatric populations. The recovery process involves cooperation of the local 
agencies, the private sector and non-governmental organizations (such as volunteer organizations, civic organizations, 
healthcare, and the private sector) and the state. The Flint plan for recovery should outline the basic framework under 
which the various recovery agencies will operate, leaving the specific and detailed actions to each agency or 
organization to implement based on the recovery needs of the community and their regulatory authority, fiscal and 
other resources. This plan could be developed using a Unified Command structure under the direction of the local 
jurisdiction. 

Conclusion: 

There are many benefits to the ICS structure for all hazards emergencies. However, utilizing the CHECC at the current 
stage of this incident without a local ICS structure would appear to be more controlling than coordinating and could 
have negative outcomes. The deficits in this incident appear to be too many agencies working in silos and a lack of 
routine, consistent communications horizontally and vertically. A local Unified Command structure could still be 
implemented to correct these issues. 

The CHECC is not required for the state-level assistance that is already being provided by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, the Chief Medical Executive, Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, 
Environmental Epidemiology and other staff. State level emergency management (SEOC) has not stepped into an 
operational role in the incident and the CHECC normally follows as support to that command lead. All staffs in the 
bureau/administration/department however are available to provide technical assistance to public health and healthcare 
when requested without an ICS structure. If a special team of subject matter experts needs to be assigned it is part of 
the daily operations and planning (for example with public health investigations of disease outbreaks) used to assist our 
partners across the state. 

The MDHHS Action Plan for the Flint Water Public Health Response, demonstrates the numerous areas where the 
department is directly involved with federal, state and local partners and itemizes the issues that are being addressed. 
MDHHS can easily increase the frequency of the Action Plan updates to better ensure appropriate communication of 
activities with partners such as the Governor’s Task Force on Flint Water Issues, the DEQ, the Genesee County Health 
Department, and others.

Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 

Governor's Task Force on Flint Water follow up on lead abatement funding questions 

What is total funding availability for lead abatement- please list by source? 

Current abatement funding available is for abatement of lead-based paint hazards only 
by federal definition and does not include funding for water remediation. 

Currently, the Division of Environmental Health, Healthy Homes Section has $1,239,761 
in state General Funds and approximately $450,000 in U. S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) funds for lead-based paint hazard abatement for Fiscal 
Year 2016. 

The Healthy Homes Section identified 10 target areas throughout the state for this 
funding based on number of children with elevated lead levels and amount of pre-1978 
housing stock to receive priority for this funding. Genesee County is included as a 
designated target area. Also included as a target area is Kent County and the City of 
Grand Rapids as they were not awarded HUD funding during this round. 

Amount of HUD funding that GCHD could have applied for had they chosen to do so? 

In FY 2015, HUD made available lead-based paint hazard control funding in which 
agencies could apply for up to $3,325,000 (3 year funding round) for lead hazard 
abatement. The MDHHS, Healthy Homes Section applied and received $3,231,610 in 
HUD funds in FY 2015. The Genesee County Health Department and/or the City of Flint 
did not apply. 

How much of the lead abatement funding has historically gone to Genesee County? Wayne 
County? City of Flint?

2009 $3,535,372 

2014 $3,637,000 

State 

Through the Healthy Homes Section, Lead Safe Home Program, since inception of the 
program in 1997: 

Genesee County/City of Flint 

Approximately $1,330,688 has been used to abate lead-based paint hazards in 
approximately 224 homes located in Genesee County, with $1,183,503 (approximately 
203 homes) of this funding going directly to homes located in the City of Flint. 

Wayne County 

Approximately $3,175,249 has been used to abate lead-based paint hazards in 
approximately 528 homes located in Wayne County, with $2,735,645 (approximately 
448 homes) of this funding going directly to homes located in the City of Detroit. 

How many homes in city of Flint abated in FY 15? Any homes abated thus far in FY 2016? 

Through the MDHHS Lead Safe Home Program, of the 177 homes abated statewide in 
Fiscal Year 2015, nine were projects located within the City of Flint. In addition, there 
are currently three enrolled properties within the City of Flint to date in Fiscal Year 
2016. 

Genesee County and/or the City of Flint did not apply for HUD funding in Fiscal Year 

2015 and therefore does not currently have their own funding available for lead-based 
paint hazard abatement.

MDHHS releases latest data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care, case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - Preliminary data indicates that 30 of 1,361 adults and children tested in Flint 
since October 1 had elevated blood lead levels, according to a report issued today by the 
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 

This marks the first summary report on lead testing called for in the state’ s action plan related to 
health concerns about Flint’s water infrastructure. 

“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, 
MDHHS chief medical executive. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those with 
elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with the Genesee 
County Health Department to reach these families. We will remain diligent in our ongoing 
outreach and education efforts.” 

Information comes from tests administered city wide to 1,361 children and adults since October 
1. Tests showed that 21 of 969 children age 17 or younger and 9 of 392 adults over the age 18 
were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The report covers test results reported to MDHHS since the state action plan was put in place 
Oct. 2. It includes the number of tests and number of elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 
micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary and venous blood tests that have been 
reported to MDHHS since the beginning of October. People who have had multiple tests are 
counted only once. Five micrograms per deciliter is the level that the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention considers elevated and triggers health care professional follow up with families. 

The full report is posted online at www.michigan.gOY/flmtwater and will be updated as more 
data becomes available. 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter 
of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors 
including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer months. 

In the third quarter of 2010, 8.3 percent of Flint children 6 and under showed elevated blood lead 
levels. The figure gradually decreased to 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2013. During the 
same months in 2014, die figure increased to 7.5 percent and decreased to 6.4 percent in the third 
quarter of 2015.

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letters to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
The state is providing funding for GCFID nurses to work with families when an elevated blood 
lead level has been detected. During these follow-up visits, nurses coordinate with environmental 
health investigators to meet with families in their homes to identify lead exposures, address 
questions and provide water filters. People can be exposed to lead from paint, soil, plumbing and 
other sources. 

MDF1HS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations, including the MDF1F1S Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of distribution, visit 

w w w . michigan . gov/ flint w ater , 


To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDF1HS has created an instructional video on its YouTube channel . For

This is a good start but maybe lacking context . Would GiS software identify clusters ? I am disappointed to see, at this moment

You must understand that the areas with the most problems in blood and water are where I have spent the last 24 years in

Subject: Summary Data 

This afternoon at 2:30 p.m., the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services will issue the attached press 
release and summary report detailing the latest data on blood lead levels in Flint. 


Director Lyon wanted to ensure that members of the Governor's Task Force received this information in advance of the 
press release being issued. 


The summary report provides annual historical information on children younger than six years, children between the 
ages of six and seventeen years and adults tested for lead. It also provides detail on the number of test results for these 
category groups that have tested above five micrograms per deciliter. The summary report also provides information on 
the numbers tested and with elevated blood lead levels since the MDHHS Action Plan began in October. 


The preliminary data indicates that 30 of 1,361 adults and children tested in Flint since October 1 bad elevated blood 
lead levels. 


Please let us know if there are any additional questions or if you would like to arrange for a conversation with Director 
Lyon, Dr. Wells or any member of the MDHHS team for additional information. 

Thank you,

Hi Lindsey, 

In your Michigan Radio documentary on Flint water, you missed an important piece in your timeline, where you wrote 
"...And once Detroit realized Flint was going to leave its system , it jacked Flint's water rates up even more - to the tune of 
$10 million over the two years the new pipeline would be under construction. 

So in the spring of 2013, Detroit kind of had Flint over a barrel. 

It was state treasury officials who got creative. 

Their solution? 

Forget Detroit, Flint's emergency manager said. Let Flint get really cheap water from the Flint River. " 

That's not factual information for your readers and listeners. In fact, in the spring of 2013, the Flint City Council, and 
Mayor Walling, made the decision to switch to Karegnondi, and in the meantime, take some of its water from the Flint 
River. This was approved at the city council meeting in a 7-1 vote on Monday, March 25, 2013. Their decision was then 
sent to the emergency manager to approve. In fact, at the time, Flint City Council President Scott Kincaid said "I've never 
been a fan of staying with Detroit." 

It is critical to note that Flint and Genesee Co. had been in discussions to start their own water authority for years before 
this decision was reached. They had been gathering information on a switch and leaning toward that decision far before 
the Gov. was even in office. 


Here is a link to the city council resolutions, as well as a comprehensive story from 2013 on that city council's decision. 

httn://www.mlive.r.:om/rtew£/filnt/snde>x.ssf/2Qi3/03/f!tr5t dtv council annrnves re.html 


This needs to be corrected, and quickly. Please let me know if you'd like any additional information or resources to add 
to the timeline of events published yesterday. 


Thank you,

- The City of Flint continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of March 
are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe water. 
However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all testing 
sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant by the 
MDEQ. Monthly testing remains ongoing and is being conducted by several parties. 

- The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M granulated active- 
charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be completed in mid-

Today Harvey and I met with the Flint Water Task Force. It was a good meeting. People were pleased with the G's 
statement from the prior day. Captain Kelenske joined us and we had a very good discussion about moving forward with 
the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency Coordinating Committee (FIACC). Tim Becker and Captain Kelenske 
provided me with a fair amount of input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for a State of Emergency which 
Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I have distilled all of this into a two page plan that I 
want your edits and comments on and a one page organizational chart (now presented in the "governor's colors" 
according to our fine people in Communications). Spoiler alert— I made Captain Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole 
shebang (with the Colonel's blessing) so Harvey wouldn't get lonely. 

Here is my ask of you: 

1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the Governor either New Year's Day or 
Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday (Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the meeting January 7 along with 
financial resources that we still need some estimates on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change the narrative focus on 
Monday's Genesee County declaration of emergency 

I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge period but I do appreciate everyone's 
efforts and I know the Boss really does as well.

A Proposal to Create the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee 

(FIACC) 


In collaboration with the Flint After-Action Task Force, MSP Captain Chris Kelenske, DHHS Chief Deputy 
Tim Becker and DH FHS Director Nick Lyon, Harvey Hollins and Rich Baird are recommending the 
immediate creation of the above referenced entity, with its sustained role and responsibility enabled 
under the Governor's Executive Order. 

Statement of Need 

Due to a combination of resource constraints, inexperienced personnel, "silo" bureaucratic processes 
and reactionary approaches to immediate problems, there is a nearly complete lack of coordination, 
communication, and connected management amongst all the departments and stakeholders who must 
work together to ensure Flint's return to clean, safe water and to coordinate mid and long term efforts 
to mitigate and address future health and behavioral consequences from lead ingestion. This group 
MUST be stood up regardless of whether (or when) the conditions required for a declaration of 
emergency are met by the City, County, State or Federal authorizers. This coordinating body must 
include: 

• The creation of a routine information process between all parties. 

• Pursuit of other avenues of funding including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• While the Emergency Management Act or the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
may be mechanisms to fix the issues in Flint, portions of the Emergency Management Act outlining 
management of events are applicable and should be implemented without delay (e.g. Local 
emergency operations plans/emergency operations guides as well as emergency operations support 
plans). 

Action Plan and Establishing the FIACCC 

It appears that a request for a Governor's declaration may be from the county as soon as January 4, 
2016. The state's Emergency Coordinator (Capt. Kelenske) will evaluate the request and provide a 
recommendation whether to issue a declaration, following established protocol and due diligence. But 
immediately, we will: 


1 . Establish an interagency workgroup Chaired and Vice-Chaired by Harvey Hollins and Chris Kelenske, 
respectively, and be comprised of DHHS, MDEQ, MSP, Treasury, Genesee County, City of Flint, MDE, 
LARA and external Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Civil Rights may be added at a later time. If 
additional agencies/stakeholders who can assist with accomplishing the action plan are needed, 
they will be added. Personnel must be goal oriented, transparent with findings and measures of 
progress, and able to work toward accomplishing the Incident Action Plan created by the state in a 
timely manner. A draft Organization Chart is attached under separate cover. 

2. This body should be created by Executive Order and it must complement and not replace the 
current system under the Emergency Management Act. In fact, it should demonstrate how to best 
leverage support where existing laws fall short under a man-made emergency. 

3. Utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as appropriate. 

4. Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive, and legislative levels as 
determined appropriate. 

5. Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 

Interagency Workgroup Objectives 


1 . Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 




■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to all stakeholders and interested parties. 

■ Logistics plan for distribution and serving homebound citizens with water and 
filtration 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods. 

■ Nutrition education and support 

■ Coping with lead exposure (care, monitoring, neurodevelopmental screening, access 
to DBP specialists, psychologists/psychiatrists, expanded county services, etc.) 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community of the situation 
and actions taken. 

■ Identify existing Public Information outlets within the city, county, and state. 

■ Establish a Joint Information Center 

■ Provide for Emergency Alerts and Updates 

■ Leverage public and private education schools 

■ Determine official information flow and approval of information. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water 
system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 

■ Develop priorities, costs, and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades 
as part of a long term recovery plan. 

■ Seek partners to assist (NGOs, Foundations, Business, etc.) 

■ Implement the plan. 

Final Thoughts 

After the team provides input to this document, I would ask that Governor Snyder review and approve 
the approach, authorize Flarvey Hollins to get the plan to Mayor Weaver no later than this weekend, and 
then proactively communicate the plan regardless of whether we get an Emergency declaration or not. 

Also, we do believe setting up an Emergency Command Center which requires 24/7 staffing is sensible 
until AFTER Genesee County has demonstrated they did all they could and couldn't solve the problem. 
That is what is required under the law. 






CITY OF FLINT 

INCIDENT ACTION PLAN 

STATE OF EMERGENCY 


Objectives: 


To provide short term relief and long term solutions in addressing the man-made emergency of 
increased lead levels in the City of Flint (the "City") water system resulting from the switch to Flint River 
as the City's water source as well as the threat to public health related to elevated blood lead levels in 
Flint residents, without interruption of the provision of public safety and other essential public services. 
Due to the fluidic nature of emergencies and the complexity of the City of Flint's declared emergency, 
this plan serves as a framework and may be altered as the emergency develops. 

The Response Framework 

The purpose of this plan is to organize efforts on behalf of the city to assess the extent of the City's 
infrastructure needs and risks to public health, provide immediate relief to those who are at risk, and 
establish long term solutions. In addition, the city must ascertain what immediate relief and long term 
solutions the City is capable of implementing based on what resources are available. For any activities 
that are beyond the resource capacity of the City, external sources of funding, supplies, and manpower 
must be sought. 

There are a number of steps that must be taken in accordance with the Flint Emergency Support 
Operations Plan (SEOP), in order for the City to be compliant with the Genesee County Emergency 
Action Guidelines. These include the activation of the Incident Management Team, the Emergency 
Operation Center, and the sharing of essential documents with the County, including this plan. 
Information must also be shared by the City's Public Information Officer on a regular basis, as required 
by the SEOP. 

This plan calls for the provision of immediate relief to those at risk in our community. Special 
consideration must be given to residents who belong to underserved groups, such as those who are 
homebound, undocumented, in poverty, etc. Additional consideration must also be given to the 
equitable provision of services throughout our community in order to equally protect the health and 
safety of every member of our community. 

Implementation of this plan is to be conducted by the Incident Management Team, which will monitor 
the effective delivery of goods and services in order to address the conditions of the emergency. 

Understanding the Issue: 

October 1, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a Public Health Emergency after 
elevated blood-lead levels were found among children in the City of Flint. This incident correlates with 
elevated levels of lead found in the City's drinking water after the City switched water sources in April of 


2014 to the Flint River. The scope of this problem appears to be limited to Flint City Water Customers 
and their dependents. Public agencies from several levels of government, as well as charitable, nonprofit 
organizations have partnered with the City to provide immediate relief to Flint residents, including the 
expansion of health services, the provision of bottled water and NSF rated water filters. The city is also 
seeking long term infrastructure improvements to eliminate lead and other contaminants from the 
water system. 

Gov. Rick Snyder appointed a task force to review "actions regarding water use and testing in Flint" and 
to make recommendations for future guidelines: Members of the state task force are Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants, Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council, Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center. 

In an effort to halt the further escalation of this crisis, the City returned to receiving its water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) on October 16, 2015. Since that time, additional 
corrosion control program has started, estimating a reduction of lead levels over the next six months. In 
light of these efforts, concerns surrounding the quality of water and health of the residents persist to 
the point that Mayor Karen Weaver declared a State of Emergency on December 14, 2015 so as to 
resolve this crisis once and for all. 

The current challenge facing the City is providing immediate relief and long term solutions of the quality 
of the water and health of residents while the City remains in a financially critical condition. It is hoped 
and expected that higher levels of government recognize this emergency as it pertains to the condition 
of the City's infrastructure and health of its residents, and do all things necessary to assist the City in the 
provision of relief and the execution of capital improvement projects that will eliminate the causes of 
this emergency. 

Enhancing Understanding: 

Information Collection 

Essential Elements of Information (EEls) can be qualified as the City's water tests containing lead results, 
the verification of lead water lines (both public and private), and health information. Water testing is 
performed by the City's water plant in cooperation with the MDEQ.. The verification of lead water lines is 
being handled by University of Michigan Flint, who is currently digitizing the City's water line 
information and PSI Engineering, who is initiating the effort to verify lead lines by excavating an initial 
150 residential lines. This information allows the Incident Management Team to assess the current 
condition of the emergency by way of determining the water quality and the condition of the water 
distribution infrastructure. 


Information Analysis 

The City has sought partners to assist in the analysis and attenuation of complex data. Wayne State 
University's center for Urban Studies has agreed to assist the City in its efforts to document and track 
lead water lines, water test results, and filter distribution with geographic information system (GIS) 
technology. This allows for easily updateable, digestible information to be presented to officials. 

Assessment of Impacts 

The City will need assistance in determining the total cost of damage done to the public health and 
infrastructure. As of now, only portions of this damage are visible. 

PSI is providing some assistance by excavating 150 residential water lines to verify that they are 
comprised of lead. This is an initial step, but not enough. More resources will be needed to continue this 
process. 

Continuous Situational Awareness 

It is important that the Emergency Management Team receive continuous information regarding water 
testing results, lead water line numbers, and filter distribution information in order to gain a realistic 
and current perspective. Much of his information is currently available on the City's website 
(cityofflint.com) and more is added each week by the PIO team. 

Actions taken in Response to the Emergency 

Activation of the Incident Management Team 

Upon the declaration of Emergency by Mayor Weaver, the Support Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP) 
was activated. The SEOP calls upon the Incident Management Team to generate the Incident Action Plan 
(IAP. Each member of this team serves a specific function as it relates to addressing the causes and 
effects of the emergency. The Emergency Management Team roster can be found in the SEOP on page 
3, with a list of alternates on page 4 in case the need for succession arises. 

Emergency Operations Center 

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) must be activated upon the declaration of a State of 
Emergency by the Mayor. This center is required by the SEOP and serves as a nerve center for the 
Incident Management Team. Here, emergency relief efforts are coordinated by key members of the 
Incident Management Team. In this case, these relief efforts consist of the distribution of water filters at 



City Hall and community events, the distribution of bottled water throughout the city in conjunction 
with the efforts of community partners, and assisting with the circulation of water testing kits 
throughout the community. The EOC will also be monitoring and managing the inventory of relief 
supplies, such as water filters and bottled water. 

According to the SEOP, the EOC must establish an incident tracking system. This system will serve as a 
work plan for the management of the emergency. In addition, it is essential that the IMT record water 
testing results, lead water line location information, and information about the distribution of water 
filters and bottled water all in one place so that information is readily available for the Incident 
Management Team. This information will also be sent out to the public and media in the form of daily 
regular updates by the City's PIO. 

Communication 

The EOC maintains a telephone system that exists to intake questions about relief efforts and to 
organize relief logistics. It is open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. A voicemail system and 
eventual email system will exist to handle requests and inquiries that occur outside of the normal 
operating hours. This system will be constructed by the City's IS department. 

Public Awareness and Education 

1. Emergency Alerts and Updates: 

The City's Public Information Officer will make available information as it relates to the 
emergency in the form of press releases, emails, and physical documents. Daily updates 
containing information on the distribution of water filters, bottled water, water testing, blood 
lead testing, and other relief efforts will be available on the City's website for the public to view. 
Information will be available at City Hall for residents. 

2. Joint Information Center: 

The City's PIO will establish a joint Information Center that is organized to coordinate the efforts 
of multiple agencies to communicate with the public. This includes the circulation of joint press 
releases, public health information, educational materials, and updates relating to the State of 
Emergency. This committee is comprised of public information officers and public relations 
personnel to coordinate efforts to keep the public updated and informed. Regular updates to 
the media regarding events and progress will be made as news develops. 

The US EPA has offered assistance in the form of Public Information support. Additional support 
in this area has been provided by the Michigan State Police. 


3. Education: 

Many government agencies and philanthropic organizations are already distributing information 
regarding the effects of lead on public health. It is important that the City assist in these efforts 
so vital information and knowledge is presented to all members of the community. The goal is to 
continue to eliminate misunderstandings and incorrect information as it relates to reducing lead 
in drinking water, pursuing medical help, and maintaining a healthy diet to reduce lead 
absorption in the body. Lead education is currently being performed by the Genesee County 
Health Department, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Medical 
community at-large. 


Assessment of Social Needs 

In order to effectively and equitably provide immediate relief to Flint water customers, the City must 
take into account many of the socio-economic needs and limitations of the community. Some residents 
cannot get to City Hall for a water filter. Some residents do not have internet access. Literacy or a 
language barrier may also pose significant obstacles to the effective distribution of educational 
information and relief to those in need. These will be continuing challenges facing the community. At 
present these are the resources the City has available to mitigate some of those challenges. 

Logistics 


Logistics are being coordinated by the City Emergency Management Team's City's Chief Logistics Officer, 
who is the City Administrator. The CLO is responsible for the coordination, procurement, and 
transportation of goods and services, which is essential for effective implementation of the response 
plan. 

Fixed Distribution Points 

There are several locations throughout the city where residents may acquire a water filter. These 
locations are: 


Flint City Hall 

1101 South Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 

Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) 

601 North Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 
and 

2727 Lippencott Blvd, Flint Ml 48507 



Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 

4809 Clio Road, Flint Ml 48504 
and

Mobile Distribution Centers 

With the help of transportation agencies, like the Metro Transit Authority (MTA), meals on wheels, and 
GCCARD, the city can help establish mobile distribution centers and delivery systems that can provide 
water filters, bottled water, and nutritious foods, among other types of relief accompanied by 
educational materials to neighborhoods and to homes of people who experience limited mobility. 

• Mass Transportation Authority-MTA bus passes: Assisting residents with bus passes to 
improve their mobility will increase their chances of receiving help. Transportation 
services will also improve residents' access to medical care. 

• MTA-Your Ride mobile distribution: 

0 Estimated Costs: $25 per hour to deliver water and filters to homes throughout 
the City. 

Problem 1. Public Health Emergency 

The first objective in addressing this emergency is reducing, and eventually eliminating, the danger to 
public health. As City water coming out of faucets continue to contain lead, and copper and other 


7 


































harmful contaminants exceeding government guidelines and regulations, it poses a risk to the people of 
our community. Preventative measures must be taken to avoid the effects of toxicosis that are difficult if 
not impossible to completely reverse. 

As far as preventative measures are concerned, education, water filters, and bottled water must be 
provided to every household in the City in order to reduce the chances of lead exposure, especially to 
our most vulnerable members of the community. If lead exposure has occurred, resulting in elevated 
blood lead levels, immediate and sustained medical attention must be available to those affected. 

Health services must be expanded in the area to accommodate increased numbers of case loads and 
specialized care regarding lead poisoning and its effects. 

Immediate Relief for Public Health: 

1. Prevention: Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing, and bottled 
water must be available to everyone. 

2. Access to nutritious food that reduces the risks of lead absorption by the body. The City can 
coordinate activities with the County Health Department 

Long Term Solutions: Maintaining Public Health and Coping with Lead Exposure 

1. Work closely with the Genesee County Health Department and Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services in order to provide sustainable care and monitoring of children exposed to 
lead. This care must be available for them for several years-preferably several decades. 

2. Support and education for primary care providers regarding aggressive long-term 
neurodevelopmental screening and testing. 

3. Improved access to developmental and behavioral (DBP) specialists, pediatric psychologists, 
pediatric psychiatrists. 

a. Pre-emptive referral to mental health/ toxic stress screenings. 

b. Support capacity building and or incentivize recruitment to allow Genesee health system 
(CMH) to build this capacity which is currently needed and lacking. 

4. Increase recognition and education regarding trauma informed care, social determinants of 
health (SDOH). 

5. Expand State funded Genesee Health System (CMH) services. 

a. Infant mental health (30 day capacity) 

b. Child case management 

c. Home based services 

d. Trauma informed care- trauma focused CBT 

Problem 2. Lead Contamination in the Water 
Immediate Relief: 


1. Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing for water customers, and 
bottled water must be available to everyone. Water filters can be obtained at any of the fixed 
distribution points throughout the City. 

2. Identification and verification of lead water service lines throughout the city- both public and 
private. 

3. Assistance to identify lead pipes within buildings and homes. 

Distribution of Bottled Water: 

At this point, we are directing all offers for donations to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan. It is 
imperative that water be accessible to all members of the community through a variety of distribution 
channels. These channels are explained in the Logistics Section of this plan. 

Distribution of Test Bottles: 

Water testing kits can be picked up at City Hall with instructions. Test results are posted on the City's 
website to raise public awareness and encourage more participation. 

Long term Solutions: Capital Improvements Needs 

The distribution of filters, water, and food to counter the effects of lead are essential response efforts to 
keep people safe. However, long term solutions are required to keep people healthy, to eliminate lead 
from the public and private water distribution system distribution, and to provide affordable clean 
water. Our public infrastructure and utilities must be reliable, sustainable, and equitable in order for this 
community to rebound after this emergency. The following long term solutions must be implemented in 
order to set the City of Flint on a course for recovery. These solutions come at a heavy cost for a City 
that is currently in receivership. The City has experienced financial distress due to this Emergency, in 
addition to a two million dollar loss from switching back to DWSD. The City has diligently applied for 
Fiscally Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships, Grant in order to supplement funding for capital 
improvement projects. It is essential that these grants be awarded in order to achieve long term 
solutions. 

1. COUPLETS Transition to a Temporary Safe Water Source until the Completion of KWA: 

This has already occurred. On October 16, 2015, Flint returned to receiving its water from DWSD 
on a 9 month agreement. This agreement will expire in June 2016, when the KWA is projected to 
be complete. The City had to pay $2 million out of its general fund to make this switch. 

2, UN PROGRESS Additional Corrosion Control added to the Water System: 


This is already occurring. In early December, 2015, Flint began to add additional corrosion 
control to the water coming in from DWSD in attempts to rebuild the protective scale inside its 
pipes. This is estimated to reduce lead levels in two to six months. 

3. Faucet Replacement: 

Replacement of Water faucets, and drinking fountains in the school system. It has been 
determined after state inspections that many sources of lead contamination in the School 
System's water were the faucets themselves. These faucets need to be replaced. 

4. Water Line Replacement: 

Water Line Replacement to reduce antiquated infrastructure and lead service lines. These lines 
must be identified, verified, and replaced. Residents who are facing financial hardships must 
have access to assistance to cover the costs of these replacements through access to grants and 
(forgivable) loans made available through State and Federal agencies. The corrosion damage to 
public and private lines that Flint River water caused is still being determined. 

• Replacement of an estimated fifteen thousand (15,000) lead service lines at an 

estimated cost of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per line. Total costs forty -five million 
dollars ($45,000,000). This project is estimated to be one of the most cost-intensive 
endeavors related to ameliorating water contaminants. 

5. Reimbursement of Critical Expenditures: 

Seeking reimbursement of two million dollar cost of returning to DWSD and forgiveness of 
Water Revolving Loan Debt from the State of Michigan. 


6. KWA Capital Improvements: The City has reconnected to Detroit temporarily until a water line 
from Port Huron is developed. The new water line known as the KWA pipeline or Karegnondi 
Water Authority is expected to bring water to the City from Lake Huron by July. The current cost 
agreement between Flint and DWSD is for nine months, therefore it is imperative that KWA be 
completed as soon as possible. Assistance relating to capital improvements to expedite this 
process will help to achieve long term goals. 


KWA Capital Improvements: 

a. Transfer Station to Dort Reservoir 

b. Raw water line to pump station #4 

c. Phosphoric acid feed system 

d. Alum Feed system 

e. Post filtration system 


Estimated Costs: 

$4,500,000 

$636,000 

$186,000 

$40,000 

$387,289 


/. SCADA Upgrades 
g. Sewer Relining 

Total 


$424,000 

$100,000 

$6,273,289 


Ancillary Considerations: Public Safety during an Emergency 

During a time of emergency public safety agencies need to be prepared to respond to threats to public 
safety and critical infrastructure. The City is facing a man-made emergency that is threatening the public 
health. Resentment and hostility toward local institutions and municipal government is at a significant 
level. 

Critical infrastructure should be safeguarded if the need arises. This includes increasing security at City 
Hall to reduce potential for public safety risks. In the case of credible threats to public infrastructure, it 
may be required to hire private security company for first line of defense. Private Security is lower cost, 
thereby making it the first option. The minimum response is acted upon first, elevating only if the need 
arises. Credible or imminent threats of damage or destruction to critical infrastructure requires an 
elevated response. Such needs may require over-time police officers to address critical situations. 
Mutual aid from surrounding communities can be requested if Flint public safety is overextended. 

Implementation: 

Community Partners 

Financial limitations of the city persist while it confronts this emergency. Many community partners 
have offered their assistance to perform various needed functions. The city is heavily reliant on the 
assistance that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have provided. 

The Mott Foundation 

The Mott Foundation has provided financial assistance, especially in their generous contribution of $4 
million. In addition, the Mott Foundation has recently pledged an additional 

United Way 

The Genesee County United Way has provided significant financial assistance in the way of purchasing 
and helping to distribute water filters since the public health emergency began on October 1 st , 2015. 

Genesee County Community Action Resources Department (GCCARD) 


11 


GCCARD is organized to fight poverty and has been a primary partner in the distribution of water filters. 
It has also regularly supported the city with the logistics and availability of water filters at City Hall. 

Genesee County Health Department 

Has provided educational information to Flint Water customers 

Genesee County Board of Commissioners 

The Board of Commissioners have pledged their support to help Flint seek solutions to this crisis. The 
Board has already assisted in making health and nutrition information available to the public. 

Assistance from Wayne State University 

Wayne State University's Center for Urban Studies will be providing technical GIS support to assist in the 
documentation of emergency relief efforts. 

The US Environmental Protection Agency 

Region 5 EPA has offered assistance with Public Information distribution during the emergency. 

Outside Help is still needed... 

The City of Flint is forever thankful to our community partners who have given so much to help so many 
people. However the magnitude of this emergency calls for more resources that are beyond the capacity 
of the combined local organizations and government agencies. Long term solutions will require a heavy 
investment in health care and capital improvement projects to upgrade the city's antiquated water 
distribution system. 

• Help with Immediate Relief in terms of assuring allocative efficiency. Distribution should 
be equitable- assistance from other governments required to assure this. 

• Reaching communities for the distribution of water filters, water, and educational 
materials. 

• Help with Water Testing to increase participation and lead education. 

• Increasing the rate of water testing 

• Assistance is required to fund essential capital improvement projects to guarantee clean 
and safe water.

About 


Corporations have been getting way with far too much for far too long. It is time that we, the citizens of the 
world, educate ourselves and take action against these Corporations. We all understand that, for past, few 
generations, we have allowed laws to be written, tax incentives to be created and have allowed loop holes to 
be made in environmental policy. We have allowed lobbiests in Washington , and other governments around 
the world, to make this capitalist institution called the "Corporation" get away with practices that are 
unacceptable. We have not understood the consequences until it is too late. We have felt too overwhelmed 
by the do's and don’ts that we have felt we had to respect, that we have allowed these powerhouses to 
benefit from massive profits, while we the majority are struggling. 

It is time that we the people take matters into our own hands. It is time to take responsibility for our 
ignorance. We must forgive ourselves for allowing this economic "Grand Canyon" between the mega wealthy 
and the other 90% of us. We hear our leaders ask us to make further sacrifices by accepting higher interest 
rates In order to pay for the mess they got us into. They have repeatedly tried to take away our voice. It is time 
forgive us our sins and move forward. We will no longer allow these Corporations and Government puppets to 
silence us. 

Like others before us, we are taking matters into our own hands. We are going to start keeping tabs on these 
Corporations. We are going to collect information and share it. We are going to spread the truth as far as we 
can. Most importantly we are going to take action!

Be a voice in a voiceless world. Share your knowledge of what you know with us so that we can unite and learn 
from each other, and become a source of power and change. 

Hey Corporations! We are watching you!

Attachments: Briefing Flint grant announcement.docx 


Team, 

Here is background on the planned Tuesday event in Flint regarding the $2 million Distressed Cities grant and other 
issues connected to the water issue. 

There are plans for two press releases on Tuesday. The first will detail the two Flint grants and will be released by the 
governor's communications office. The other release, which would detail the other grants, would follow from Treasury 
with a quote from the governor. 

Mayor Walling has agreed to speak at the event, with Harvey Hollins and Dan Wyant representing the governor's office. 
Sen. Ananich has asked to speak, and it has been suggested that Rep. Neeley would speak and it might be better to add 
him to the program. Others, such as Deputy Director Workman and Emergency Manager Ambrose, would be present 
and available. 

The attached document includes details about the planned event, as well as background on the grants from Treasury 
and on the entire water issue from DEQ as well as Mayor Walling's Facebook post about the governor and links to the 
stories in the media about the issue. 

We have a room reserved and are working with the communications team in Flint to have microphones and other items 
needed for the event. 

Please let me know if there is any information you think should also be included, or anything that should be changed. 
Once everyone has had the opportunity to review, we can forward to the governor. 

Thank you, everyone, for your assistance. I know there are lots of moving pieces and many people involved.

Background 


■ The quality of Flint water has been a high-profile concern in recent weeks, with residents 
complaining about the color, taste and smell of tap water since a switch to Flint River water as a 
temporary source as a pipeline is built to Lake Huron as a water source starting in 2016. 

o Residents have attended meetings with jugs of brownish water. 

o U.S. Kildee has worked with labor and community groups to distribute bottled water. 

■ Mayor Walling has issued a letter (included below) calling for state and federal assistance for the 
city, including forgiveness of some $20 million in debt through the Drinking Water Revolving 
Loan Fund and calling for the governor to come to Flint personally. 

o Walling also submitted a guest column to the Flint Journal with similar requests. 


■ He said the loan forgiveness is needed for the city to upgrade its water 
treatment process. 

o Governor and Mayor Walling had a telephone conversation on Friday, and the mayor 
has pledged to work together on solutions. 

■ Rep. Sheldon Neeley also has sent the governor a letter, saying that his constituents "are on the 
verge of civil unrest." 

■ The Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the water situation, with a 
detailed backgrounder and talking points attached below. 

■ The Treasury Department is announcing Tuesday that Flint is among the cities receiving a 
combined $8 million the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships grant program. 

o The announcement of the other grants will follow the Flint announcement. 

■ The Flint grants are $1.1 million to allow the city to replace the functions of the 
old incinerator with new water pollution control facility allowing for the disposal 
of waste to landfills. 

■ The other is $900,000 to allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak 
detection survey, which will lead to prioritizing repairs. 

o A breakdown of the grants is included below. 

Treasury breakdown of Flint grants 

Flint Incinerator: The grant project entails shutting down the current Water Pollution Control Facility 
Incinerator (due to the incinerator not being up to new EPA standards). In order to meet EPA standards, 
it would cost roughly $8.8M in upgrades to the current incinerator. The grant funding will allow them to 
replace the functions of the old incinerator by constructing new facilities which will allow for the 
disposal of waste to landfills. 

Budget Breakdown 

Construction Contractor $1,050,000 

Project Management $50,000 

Total $1,100,000 

Flint Leak Detection: The grant project will allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection 
survey of the city water lines. The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak 
severity. This data will allow the city to prioritize leak repair. The project also covers the expense of 
conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition assessment on a portion of the city's pipes. The 
assessment will guide the city's water main replacement program. 


Budget Breakdown 

Project Planning $90,000 

Mobilization of Crew to Site $27,000 

Leak Detection < 16" diameter $378,000 

Leak Detection 16" diameter or > $270,000 

Pipe Condition Assessments $135,000 

Total $900,000 


DEQ backgrounder on Flint water 




Following the formal approval of Flint into the KWA in 2012, DWSD sent Flint a letter saying their 
contract was thereby terminated (by early 2013). 

Genesee County has been using DWSD water without a contract since May 2014. But Flint took the 
letter to imply a water cutoff, and promptly turned to DEQ with a proposal to use the Flint River (their 
historic backup system). 

This proposed shift was pitched primarily as a money saver. But it put the city in the business of water 
production, where they historically had been in the business of water transmission. DEQ approved the 
use of the river as a source, based on the treatment plant's past performance as a standby facility and 
the improvements we outlined prior to a switchover. 

Several municipalities around the state use surface water supplies (rivers): Blissfield near Monroe, 
Manistique, and Alma to name a few. 

The city completed the upgrades at the water plant the facility and DEQ approved it April 2014. 

There were some initial hiccups. Last summer, there were a couple of 'boil water' notices issued. One 
for a water test that showed e. coli, one for a break in the water main. 

The challenge to using the Flint River as a source is that the condition of the water is variable and 
changes with season and weather. It has substantially more organic matter than deep lake sources like 
Lake Huron. This organic matter is mobilized by high water events, and warm weather also can account 
for more organic material in the water. 

The treatment of the organic matter is done with chlorine. One might conclude that the continual 
answer is just to use more chlorine to achieve water safety. However, at some point on the continuum, 
the chlorine and organic matter create TTHM - total trihalomethanes - as a byproduct. When the 
standard for those is exceeded over several consecutive quarters of testing, the supply is required by 
law to issue public notice and submit an approved plan for addressing the situation. 

You'll note that this regulatory approach means TTHM testing is done quarterly. That means people who 
use the system are exposed to TTHM for several months before the public notice is required. It's 
because TTHM is a chronic health threat. Over the long term (measured in decades), continued 
exposure can contribute to some known health problems. If this were an immediate health threat, 
customers would receive immediate notification to boil their water or not use it. 

Put in context, the EPA (which established the standard and the rule) estimates the existence of the 
TTHM standard prevents an estimated 280 bladder cancer cases each year ... out of more than 330 
million people who use public water supplies around the country. 

It's not "nothing." State and federal law requires quarterly testing for TTHM and that the public be 
informed of it when the annual average of four quarters' worth of consecutive testing shows TTHM 
levels exceeding 80 parts per billion. Flint's results managed to exceed the annual average in three 
quarters, and they must develop a plan to address it. 

But it's not like an eminent threat to public health. Unlike an e. Coli or even total coliform bacteria 
maximum contaminant level, which require immediate public notification and response and are part of 
daily / hourly testing of public water supplies, TTHMs pose a public health concern with chronic, long- 
term exposure. 

It's clear the nature of the threat was communicated poorly. It's also clear that folks in Flint are 
concerned about other aspects of their water - taste, smell and color being among the top complaints. 



The Safe Drinking Water Act requires public water supplies be tested for more than 90 regulated 
contaminants, including microbial contaminants. The act, and the program here in Michigan, work to 
ensure that water is safe to drink. The act does not regulate aesthetic values of water. Here are some 
factors affecting the aesthetics of water in Flint. 

1. It's the Flint River. The water supplied by DWSD historically came from Lake Huron. It's softer. 
With hard water, you get a different flavor and feel. It's why General Motors suspended use of 
Flint Water - it was rusting their parts. Also, there's the 'organics' factor (discussed previously). 

2. The system is old. Flint has more than 500 miles of water pipes. More than half of those pipe 
miles are more than 75 years old. Much of it is cast iron. Hard water can react with cast iron and 
exacerbates the rusty factor, which creates that brown water that angry residents were holding 
up in jugs for the media cameras last week. Valve failure has also been a key challenge. The 
system has an estimated 7,500+ valves. When they stick open or stick shut, it affects the 
hydraulics of the system and increase areas of stagnation. The city has a backlog of valves that 
need to be addressed. They've done half a dozen or so since November. 

3. Flint is old. Many of the homes served by the system are old. Brown water complaints may also 
be attributable to cast iron pipes in customers' service connection to the city lines. The DEQ has 
been encouraging people with water coloration concerns to contact the city and see whether it 
is the service line or the City's line causing the issue. Again, discoloration is not an indicator of 
water quality or water safety, but we recognize that nobody likes it. 

In summary, the City of Flint has tremendous need to address its water delivery system. We are not 
aware that they have any capital improvement funds for preventative maintenance in place, much less 
line replacement project monies that will require hundreds of millions. 

The City was approved for a Revolving Fund loan in 2008 or 2009. As a Distressed Community, they 
qualified for flexible terms and 2 percent interest rate Revolving Fund Loan. After they were notified 
they were approved for the loan, they declined it. Previous SRF loans from the state to Flint bear an 
outstanding balance of $20.7 million today. 

The DEQ continues working with the city to address the TTHM issue. They can take interim steps - from 
scrubbing the insides of transmission lines to carefully monitoring the hydraulic challenges in their 
system - to address customers' aesthetic concerns. Their TTHM numbers already are showing dramatic 
improvement; the November testing showed only one of seven sample points exceeding the standard. 

The key now is that the standard is an average of three quarters' worth of results. It will be some time 
before they are officially "not in violation." However, depending on weather in 2015, it's not 
unforeseeable that we will be having this conversation again by next Christmas. 

The key to the conversation is that TTHM is not a top health concern. That's key because residents need 
to understand TTHM in context, and it is key because it appears the mayor has seized on the public 
panic (sparked, frankly, by their poor communication of the violation notice) to ask the state for loan 
forgiveness and more money for their infrastructure improvement. 

Another key thing to remember is that once the city connects to the new KWA system in 2016, this issue 
will fade in the rearview. 

Key messages: 

1. The DEQ Drinking Water program works with communities around the state to ensure that 
municipalities provide customers with clean, safe drinking water. 

Municipal water supplies are tested rigorously and regularly for more than 90 regulated 
contaminants, including microbial contaminants that pose an immediate public health concern. 


2 . 



3. Flint's exceedance of the TTHM standard should reassure residents that the testing program is 
effective. 

4. TTHM is not an immediate health threat. It is a chronic concern, one that can be problematic 
over the course of several decades of exposure. The public was notified because the law 
requires the city to make public notification, so that everyone can make informed decisions. This 
is particularly true for people with infants or those with compromised immune systems. 

5. The DEQ is working with the City to address the situation. Recent tests show the TTHM numbers 
dropping rapidly. The department will continue working with the city in the months ahead, and 
residents should feel confident that their water is safe to drink unless the DEQ or City notifies 
them otherwise. 

6. The discoloration and odor issues some Flint residents are experiencing are separate issues from 
the TTHM issue. TTHM is odorless, colorless and measured in parts per billion. 

7. Flint water customers who have questions or concerns about their water should first contact the 
city to get answers and help. They also can contact the Michigan DEQ. 

Mayor Walling's Facebook post 

Friend, 

Access to clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human right. 

That's why I just sent Gov. Snyder my Flint Water Improvement Plan. It focuses on the areas of safety, 
quality, access, investment and education. My letter urges the governor to quickly implement these 
ideas so that Flint's water is 100% safe. 

Please contact Gov. Snyder by calling (517) 335-6397 (or by clicking here) and ask him to take action 
immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. 

My plan offers new ideas and also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs 
at the state and federal levels. Here is my plan: 

Safety & Quality 

• 100% Safety is the standard 

• City of Flint releases testing data to assure safety and expands testing to households with 
support from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 

• Support alternatives for those advised not to drink the water by their doctors through the 
Michigan Health Endowment Fund and community partners to protect the vulnerable like 
seniors and infants 

• Bring on experienced river water treatment operational management in the City of Flint 

• Require water testing data to be released quarterly by law in all Michigan communities 
Access 

• Announce an amnesty program for turn-ons and reduce the turn-on cost in Flint 

• Develop a revised payment plan policy to allow customers to come back on to the Flint system 

• New Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance Fund 
for customers (modeled on Federal and State energy utility programs: Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program; Michigan Energy Assistance Program; State Emergency Relief) 

Investment 

• Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital Improvement Plan 
through Federal and State Investments 

• State approves City of Flint's Distressed Cities Fund applications 

• Federal and State forgiveness of payment to Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund 



• Federal and State financing for future improvements 

• City Water Department implements budgeted FY15 projects including leak detection, valve 
repairs, new pipes and meter replacements 

Education 

• Develop a community partnership to provide household and business customers with 
information on testing and conservation 

• Ongoing partnership with Michigan Department of Fluman Services, United Way, Salvation Army 
and community organizations to provide information on water assistance 

• Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with conservation and efficiency (piloted in 
summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

The struggle with our water has gone on for too long. The state must take action and do its part. Please 
ask Gov. Snyder to take action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. Thank 
you for your ongoing support.

FOIA Request Flint Water.doc 


Importance: 


High 


This is the second issue I mentioned earlier today. 

in December, our staff became peripherally aware that the hospitals in Genesee were seeing an 
uptick in Legionnaires cases. 

Legionnaires is a water-borne illness, it essentially is a type of pneumonia caused by a bacteria, it is 
treated with antibiotics. Untreated, it can be deadly, it most often manifests in nursing homes and 
assisted iiving facilities, because the transmission is through water vapor getting into lungs - via air 
conditioners, vaporizers or low-flow shower heads that produce a lot of misting. You can drink water 
with this bacteria in it and not get sick - it. has to enter the Sungs in vapor. 


I don't have any details on the cases, but here is what I understand to this point: 

* More than 40 cases reported since last April. That's a significant uptick - more than ail the 
cases in the last five years or more combined. 


* April / May is usually the start of Legionnaires season - it proliferates in warmer months - but 
April also is the point at which the city switched to the Flint River as a source. 

* County Health Departments are supposed to perform epidemiological tracebacks on ail 
confirmed cases of this disease, to locate the source and address it. Genesee County Health 
had not done this work as of November. At a January meeting with area hospitals, MDCH, 

DEG and others, Nick Lyon reportedly directed the county health folks, in terms not uncertain, 
to get this done as a priority. As I'm sitting here today, if still is not done to my knowledge. 

® My counterparts at MDCH informed me today that they cannot step in unless they are invited 
or unless the outbreak is multi-county. They've not been invited until, I believe, today. That 
may be in part because of the email string and Setter I’ve enclosed here, which was unknown to 
MDCH until I shared it over to them. 

The email thread below is best read bottorn-to-top, and read prior to reading the enclosed FOIA to the 
city. 

Essentially, Jim Henry with Genesee County Health is putting up the flare. He’s made the leap 
formally in his email that the uptick in cases is directly attributable to the river as a drinking water- 
source - this is beyond irresponsible, given that is his department that has failed to do the necessary 
traceback work to provide any conclusive evidence of where the outbreak is sourced, and it aiso flies 
in the face of the very thing a drinking water system is designed to do. 


i 



DEQ did not receive this FGIA, which appears designed to buttress his position in the email — that 
sections of the water delivery system may be harboring this bacteria. We think it would he highly 
unlikely that anything would be found around the plant, where the water is treated. Most often, this 
bacteria forms at the building / residential point in the system. Legionnaires is NOT among the 90 
water contaminants screened in the Safe Drinking Water Act, but in the absence of action by county 
health, our staff are now considering taking samples from various points in the system and working 
with DCH’s lab to test for it, if for no other reason than to rule it out. 

Regardless, the accusation is serious and the nature of the communication leaves me thinking we 
would be advantaged to bring together all the agencies asap to share what information we have and 
develop a response / screening strategy before the weather gets warm again. 

I realize these are long emails. Thanks for your patience, 
b

Importance: High 

The district received this late Tuesday. 

Steve Busch has indicated that the district has not received a meeting request from Jim Henry or the Genesee County 
Health Department as indicated in his email below. 

The FOIA is specifically directed to the City of Flint not the DEQ. 

While the change in source may have created water quality conditions that could provide additional organic nutrient 
source to support legionella growth, there is no evidence or confirmation of legioneiia coming directly from the Water 
Treatment Plant or in the community water supply distribution system at this time. 

Seems like the next step is to communicate with DCH and possibly develop a joint strategy/response. Not sure who in 
Exec wants to take the lead on this. Steve Busch and Mike Prysby will continue to be lead for us on this. They have been 
in contact with DCH recentiy but only to learn that little progress has been made in identifying a source or sources for 
the illnesses.

EMAIL FROM DEQ TO HENRY SE^T THIS AFTERNOON: 

Mr. Henry, 

The January 27, 2015, FOIA request you provided was directed to the City of Flint, not the DEQ. The DEQ has no record 
of a FOIA request from your office for such information, it is our understanding that the City has responded to your 
FOIA request, has helped you adequately redefine your request within the City's scope of public record to address such 
ambiguities as "any additional areas of concern", and provided you with additional information beyond the scope of 
your request. 

The DEQ fully recognizes the public health threat posed to individuals that contract Legionnaires’ Disease with the 
understanding that the disease is not contracted by ingestion of potable water and therefore not regulated under the 
federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Your email below claims that you have explicitly explained the situation to our 
Department. However, since contacting our office early last October to indicate a rise in cases, we have not received 
any further information regarding your epidemiological investigation into this matter. 

Further, conclusions that legionella is coming from the public water system without the presentation of any 
substantiating evidence from your epidemiologic investigation appears premature and prejudice toward that end. 

It is highly unlikely that legionella would be present in treated water coming from the City of Flint water treatment plant 
given the treatment plant’s use of ozone along with complete treatment and chlorine disinfect contact time to comply 
with federal surface water treatment rules for potable water. Detections of total coliform or heterotrophic bacteria in 
the City’s public water distribution system indicate an environment where bacterial growth may be 
supported. However, there is no direct correlation that can be made to the presence of legionella. While total organic 
carbon levels in potable water may serve as a food source for bacteria growth in private plumbing system, water 
temperatures in the City's distribution system are below legionella growth range, and chlorine residual levels would also 
limit such growth. 


Our office agrees that water main breaks, water leaks, and system repairs are possible vectors for legionella to enter the 
public water system. These should be investigated as part of your epidemiology. DEQ staff can be made available to 
assist GCHD and the City regarding such matters, but to date no request by GCHD for any such meeting has been 
received, let alone declined as alleged in your email. 


if GCHD Is seeking assistance to complete its epidemiological investigation regarding this matter, such resource requests 
should be directed to the Michigan Department of Community Health. Our Office agrees that a multi-agency 
partnership would be beneficial to move forward and develop a unified response. In that respect, if our Office can be of 
any further assistance you may contact me directly.

Hello everyone, 


The Genesee County Health Department has made several written and verbal requests for specific information since 
October, 2014, including a Freedom of Information Act Request on January 27, 2015. The information still has not been 
received and the city’s lack of cooperation continues to prevent my office from performing our responsibilities. 

The Genesee County Health Department has the responsibility to conduct illness investigations and consider ail potential 
sources, this is not optional. In 2014, Genesee County experienced a significant increase of confirmed Legionella 
illnesses relative to previous years. Legionella can be a deadly, waterborne disease that typically affects the respiratory 
system. 

The increase of the illnesses closely corresponds with the timeframe of the switch to Flint River water. The majority of the 
cases reside or have an association with the city. Also, McLaren Hospital identified and mitigated Legionella in their water 
system. This is rather glaring information and it needs to be looked into now, prior to the warmer summer months when 
Legionella is at its peak and we are potentially faced with a crisis. 

This situation has been explicitly explained to MDEQ and many of the city’s officials. I want to make sure, in writing that 
there are no misunderstandings regarding this significant and urgent public health issue. The Trihalomethane issues “pale 
in comparison” to the potential public health risks of Legionella. 

I am submitting the attached FOiA request again and requesting that the legal obligations of the request are met. If the 
information is not available, please let. me know. In the past, I have requested to meet with the water plant staff and 
MDEQ regarding Legionella concerns. I did not receive a response from the water plant staff and MDEQ declined. I think 
it is in the best interest for ail stakeholders that we meet and discuss the issues. 

Respectfully, 

Jim

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 


• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 

• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 

WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

PRESS RELEASE: City of Flint Lead Advisory 

GCHD Lead in Water Fact Sheet.pdf; Lead Advisory Release.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Issues Lead Advisory 


Flint, Michigan - September 25, 2015 - The City of Flint is issuing a Lead Advisory for residents to be aware of 
lead levels in drinking water after hearing concerns from the medical community. While the City is in full 
compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public 
awareness campaign to ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe. 

The Genesee County Health Department has issued a fact sheet regarding lead precautions for residents. The 
fact sheet can be found on their website at www. g chd.us. Here are a few of the suggestions the Health 
Department recommends: 

■ Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes 

■ Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making baby formula. 

■ Install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. 

Lead contamination can leach into water from a home’s lead water service lines, lead solder, and leaded 
plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. Older service lines with pipes and fixtures installed 
before 1986 can sometimes be more susceptible to lead issues due to materials used in the home such as lead 
based paint and lead pipes.

The City of Flint is working proactively along with the County Health Department, the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to improve the water system throughout 
the City. An accelerated plan to add a corrosion control agent to our water within 30 to 60 days with expedited 
approval from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is already underway. This will reduce 
corrosion which can cause lead in old pipes to leach into the water. 

This plan is in addition to Mayor Walling’s letter requesting $30 Million in water infrastructure assistance 
funding from the State of Michigan. $10 Million of that request would be for the replacement of lead service 
lines in households to ensure that lead no longer presents a danger to the drinking water of our residents. As the 
letter states, “It is the City’s position that the abatement of lead through the removal of lead containing pipes 
and fixtures in homes is the best long term solution to keeping our residents’ water safe.” 

Mayor Walling further stated: "I am extremely concerned about the risks around lead with Flint's children and I 
will be working tirelessly to ensure the water is safe and all of our families have the information they need. I 
also will continue to pursue funding for infrastructure improvements and a comprehensive healthy homes 
initiative that addresses lead in paint and pipes. We have to get the lead out of our community to eliminate the 
threat of childhood lead poisoning." 

The City of Flint continues working proactively with the County Health Department, the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to improve the water system 
throughout the City. The City remains committed to working with all of our partners in the Water Technical 
Advisory Committee to address all issues of public health and quality concerns that face the 
community. Updates on progress made in addressing this issue will be made during regular public meetings 
including City Council and other scheduled meetings. Information on this and all related matters will continue 
to be posted on the City of Flint’s website, cityofflint.com .

How does lead get into my tap water? 

Under typical circumstances, lead will dissolve into the water. The concentration of lead, in drinking water 
can vary greatly, depending on the corrosiveness of the water, the type and age of the plumbing materials 
and die length of time that the water stands in the pipes. The highest levels of lead occur when very 
corrosive water stands motionless in lead or lead soldered pipe for long periods of time. 


The only way to know whether your tap water contains lead is to have it tested. You cannot see, taste, or 
smell lead in drinking water. There are different sampling methods for sampling lead in. drinking water. 
To determine your household risk, it is recommended to take a first draw sample. 


Does lead in my tap water cause health effects? 

lead can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children 
and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal mental and physical 
development of growing bodies. Lead in water can be a special problem for infants, whose diets may be 
mostly liquids, such as baby formulas or concentrated juices mixed with water. Smaller bodies can absorb 
lead, more rapidly than bigger ones, A child's mental and physical growth can be permanently harmed by 
too much lead. Risk will vary, depending on the individual, the circumstances, and the amount of water 
consumed. 


What ttm I do to reduce or dominate lead in mv Urn water? 

Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes. The longer the water has 
been sitting in the pipes, the more lead it may contain. You can fill containers for later use, after the 
flushing process. Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels because it dissolves more lead. 

You may choose to install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. If a water filter is installed, 
replace filters at least as often as recommended by the manufacturer. 

Buy a lead-free faucet. The legal definition of "lead-free" still allows brass faucets to contain up to 8 
percent lead. However, faucets marked with "NSF 61/9" and/or "California Proposition 65" meet stricter 
limits. Regularly clean particles from faucet aerators. 







Is it safe to take a bath or shower, if my water has high lead levels? 

Yes. Bathing and showering should be safe for you and your children, even i f the water contains lead over 
EPA’s action level. Human skin does not absorb lead in water. Tills information applies to most situations 
and to a large majority of the population, but individual circumstances may vary. Some situations, such, as 
cases involving highly corrosive water, may require additional recommendations or more stringent 
actions. 


Who do I contact for more information? 

The local water authority is always your first source for testing and identifying lead contamination in your 
tap water. You can visit the City of Flint. Website at www.dtyofflint.com or contact the Flint Water 
Department at 810-787-6537.

For Immediate Release 

City of Flint Issues Lead Advisory 

Flint, Michigan - September 25, 2015 - The City of Flint is issuing a Lead Advisory for 
residents to be aware of lead levels in drinking water after hearing concerns from the 
medical community. While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to 
ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe. 

The Genesee County Health Department has issued a fact sheet regarding lead 
precautions for residents. The fact sheet can be found on their website at www.achd.us . 
Here are a few of the suggestions the Health Department recommends: 

■ Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes 

■ Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. 

■ Install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. 

Lead contamination can leach into water from a home’s lead water service lines, lead 
solder, and leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. Older

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council March 25, may have set in motion the end to 

Flint paying to get its water from Detroit 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for 
treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the 
Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department Of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per 
day from the Flint River. 


Tuesday's meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 
“We got there," Councilman Joshua Freeman said, "That's the important thing.” 


There were more than 50 people at Monday's meeting. 

"Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion art: the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca 
Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition eyecdti ^liililllil "If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at 
risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs." 



Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste 
advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Hint has an emergency financial manager. 
All expenditures oyer £50,000 must be approved. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water 
service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save million overelgHt^ieirs by getting water from the Kwa, 

’Tt's a historic djght in the City of less with the capacity level approved by city 

council because there will be increased treatment cost for toe 111111111111 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work 
done at Flint's water plant. 

Flint's water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only 
operates four times per year. 

Councilman Bryant Holden was the lone dissenting vote* 

"It was a protest vote," Holden said. "I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 


Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint 
and Lapeer.

GENESEE COUNTY, MI — The state has approved a critical permit that allows the Karegiiondi 
Water Authority to tap into Lake Huron with a 1.5-mile underground intake. 


But water authority officials are still waiting for Flint to decide if it will he part of it. 


ConslTueiion on the Intake — estimated to cost $27 million — might mark the no-tuming-back 
point for the massive project, and county Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said other developments 
make it necessary Flint to make a final decision on its involvement in the next few months. 


As control of Flint has shifted from mayors and city councils to emergency managers, the city has 
never committed to buying a minimum volume of water from the KWA. 

"The only question at this point really is whether Flint is going to be a partner," said Wright, who has 
met with emergency financial manager Ed Kurtz and wants to resolve the question before Kurtz 
leaves his position — something likely to happen soon after the November election. 

"I'd say we have a couple of months here," Wright said of Flint's deadline. He described Kurtz as 
positive about the city's potential involvement but said, "There's still some questions Flint is working 
on with Detroit and Lansing.” 


Kurtz said he can't predict what will happen. 


"We're looking at all our options," Kurtz said Friday. 

County Commissioner Ted Henry, D-Clayton Twp., said regardless of the city's participation, the 
pipeline can be built by the remaining partners: Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties and the city of 
Lapeer, 

"The answer is yes," Henry said. "It will be a little different but it can go," 


4 




The drain commissioner said construction of the pipeline intake, which has already been designed, is 
expected to start this year, after the job is put out for bids and borrowing is authorized by the county 
Board of Commissioners, 

Building the intake will be specialized work, part of which must be done from a barge, and will require 
building tunnels below the sand bo ttom of the lake and laying an 8 4 -inch pipe below the surface of 
the water. 

In addition to the state Department of Environmental Quality permit to build the intake, the KWA 
also needs approval from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Wright said. 


A. 45-day public comment period on the intake permit has passed and county officials said they expect 
the permit to be approved within two weeks. 

Among other recent developments in the pipeline project: 

® The Genesee County Water and Waste Advisory Committee, made up of elected and appointed 
city, township and village officials, has voted unanimously to set a date for accepting public 
bids to build the intake. 

* Tire same committee has approved negotiating a contract with Wade Trim to act as program 
manager for the pipeline project once all necessary permits have been received. 

® The county has revised its estimate on the cost of the intake portion of the pipeline from $40 
million to $27 million. 


Wright said his office is ready to negotiate a contract for Wade Trim to oversee the pipeline work, and 
said he expects six or seven engineering and surveying companies to assist in getting the job done. 


County officials count those jobs among the 1,000 that they say will he created by building the 
pipeline. 

"1 want to use local (people) wherever possible and keep the money here," Wright said. 

The drain commissioner said the selection of Wade Trim is important to the city of Flint because it 
signals the start of" engineering, which includes decisions about the size of pumps, motors and pipes 
that will be used to build the pipeline. 

Flint officials have options, including the use of Flint River water, or continuing to purchase wafer 
from the city of Detroit, 


5 



Wright said the only choice for the rest of the county is build the pipeline or sign a 30-year contract 
with Detroit. 


A KWA study claims that continuing to buy water from Detroit will cost the region $2.1 billion during 
the next 25 years. By building a pipeline, that cost would be $1.9 billion over the same period, the 
KWA Web site says. 


After the initial 25-year period, the cost of water would be less than 25 percent of the projected cost of 
water form Detroit, according to KWA.

PRESS RELEASE: EM Statement on Flint's Water 

EM Statement on Water 3.24.2015.pdf; EM Letter to Treasury Regarding Water.PDF 


For Immediate Release 


Emergency Manager Statement on Water: Spending Extra $12 Million on Detroit Water 

“Incomprehensible” When Flint Water Just as Safe 


Flint, Michigan -March 24, 2015 - At the City Council meeting held on Monday, March 23, 2015, Flint City 
Council made a motion to “do all things necessary” to return to using water purchased from Detroit and 
discontinue use of the Flint River as a water source. The following statement from Emergency Manager Gerald 
Ambrose addresses that point: 


“Flint water today is safe by all EPA and MDEQ standards and the City is working daily to improve its quality.

“It is incomprehensible to me that 7 members of the Flint City Council would want to send more than $12

Emergency Manager Statement on Water: Spending Extra $12 Million 
on Detroit Water “Incomprehensible” When Flint Water Just as Safe 

Flint, Michigan- March 24, 2015- At the City Council meeting held on Monday, March 23, 
2015, Flint City Council made a motion to “do all things necessary” to return to using water 
purchased from Detroit and discontinue use of the Flint River as a water source. The 
following statement from Emergency Manager Gerald Ambrose addresses that point: 


“Flint water today is safe by all EPA and MDEQ standards and the City is working daily 
to improve its quality. Users also pay some of the highest rates in the state because of 
the decreased numbers of users and the age of the system. 

“It is incomprehensible to me that 7 members of the Flint City Council would want to send 
more than $12 million a year to the system serving southeast Michigan, even if Flint rate 
payers could afford it. Water from Detroit is no safer than water from Flint. 

“If $12 million annually were available for discretionary use, it would be far better spent 
reducing rates paid by Flint customers and/or modernizing the City's system.”

sustainabie basis. The steps taken over the past fhteeyeaM have beers difficult. Taxes and fees have 
been raised, servicesand workforce redrseed, avid; ongoing costs, including legacy costs, have been 
constrained. 

Hie emtent controversy surrounding the provision of water, and the path for resolution, has a 
potentially significant impact: on the: progress that is being made. I am satisfied that the water 
provided So Flint users today is within all MDEQ and EPA guidelines, as evidenced by the most 
reeentWater quality results conducted for MDEQ. We have a continuing cpnimilment to maintain 
water safety and to improve water ;^svuce this eormtufment 

will he made, 

City should return to DWSD, even for a short period of time, 
Would,, in mv judgment, have extremely negative dmucial conseguenees to the water system, and 
consequently to the rate payers. By the most conservative estimates, such a move would increase 
costs by at least $12 millioxr annually, with that amount achieved only by eliminating virtually all 
budgeted imptpyemcm the system. For a system with Unrestricted Assets ofonly $740,745, 
according to the June 30, 2014 audited financial statements, the only recourse within ihevCity'S 
control would be to increase revenues significantly. And in my judgment, dial would come from 
raising i^ps.fof Water by:30$i or more , Further, clianging the source of the eity % water would 
not necessarily change any of the aesthetky vf the water, including odor add discoloration, since 
those appear to be directly related to the aging pipes and otiicr isiiTastructiue that camywater fi'om

This direction of discussion also deviates from what, in my judgment, should be the focus: How 
can we not only operate and maintain a system to assure the delivery of safe and quality water 
dependably, but significantly reduce the cost of water and sewer to the users? At an average of 
$149 per month for water and sewer service for a residential user, the cost is extremely high in 
comparison to surrounding areas, as well as most areas across the state, and creates a significant 
financial burden for many users. In my judgment, we should all be concentrating on how to reduce 
rates by 50% or more. Unfortunately, there are no easy or evident answers, and continuation of 
the status will be an impediment to the sustainable recovery of the City of Flint. It is a conversation 
that I expect we will have with the recently created Water Quality Advisory Committee. 

My reasoning for this conclusion is as follows: 

One of the decisions made in the context of beginning to eliminate deficits and to restore financial 
stability to the City of Flint was to increase water and sewer rates significantly - the only choice 
available to financially stabilize a system that as of June 30, 2012, had a deficit of $8,758,091. 
Another was to leave DWDS for the KWA because it offered the opportunity to lower future rate 
increases. A third decision was to utilize the Flint River on an interim basis when DWSD 
unilaterally terminated the City’s contract for water purchase. That decision was made because it 
also offered an immediate cost savings opportunity which translated into the ability to upgrade the 
Water Treatment Plant without having to seek financing. It was a reasonable decision because of 
our experience in using the river in a back-up capacity, including test runs on a quarterly basis for 
several decades. 

Unfortunately, the switch to the river as a primary source was more challenging than anticipated, 
and the harsh winter of 20 1 3-20 1 4 resulted in much more damage to the aging water infrastructure 
than in previous years. The result was the issuance of required notices that water exceeded 
established guidelines for safety as it could affect certain vulnerable populations, and some users 
of the system experienced unpleasant odors and discoloration. Some users also appeared to have 
had some negative reactions to the new source of water. However, as soon as the test results were 
known. City staff took immediate actions to address the concerns. These actions are evidenced 
today by the fact that MDEQ has certified that our most recent testing shows water from all testing 
sites to be well within acceptable guidelines. Additionally, the City is continuing to taking the 
necessary actions to assure that the water supply remains safe and that water quality continues to 
improve. 

As the City has moved to address the situation, the suggestion continues to be made that the City 
should re-engage with DWSD and purchase water at least until the KWA pipeline is supplying 
water. As evidenced by the most recent letter from DWSD, such a decision would immediately 
increase the City’s cost by $846,700 per month, or $10,160,400 per year, just for the fixed cost 
portion of the price. The actual purchase of water would be an additional fee, and dependent upon 



Wayne Workman 
March 3, 2015 
Page 3 


the quantity purchased. We estimate the actual water purchase cost to average more than $ 1 million 
per month, for a grand total of approximately $22 million per year. Finally, the DWSD offer is 
conditioned upon the City (or presumably the KWA) agreeing to negotiate a long term contract 
(30 years) for back-up. 

The $22 million annual estimate of increased costs to purchase water from DWSD would be 
minimally offset by an approximate $3 million in reduced operating costs, and could be further 
offset by an additional $9 million, but only if all funding for capital improvements to the system 
are eliminated. To eliminate all funding dedicated to repairing, stabilizing, and improving the 
system would be totally irresponsible and would have long term negative consequences to the City 
and to future rate payers. 


As you are aware we have recently brought in outside expert assistance to evaluate the steps we 
have taken to assure that the water is safe and to continue to improve water quality. We are 
expecting specific recommendations within the next few weeks, and are committed to 
implementing those recommendations in a timely manner. Many steps have already been taken. I 
am confident that implementing their recommendations will assure a continuing supply of safe 
water as well as improved quality, and at far less cost than re-engaging DWSD. 

We have also created a 40-member Water Advisory Committee and a 13-member Technical 
Advisory Committee to assure two-way communication with the public and users of the system. 
Those committees will begin to meet this week, and we look forward to answering their questions 
and receiving their input. 

It is unfortunate that problems and concerns with quality have arisen, and we are working every 
day to address the issues that caused them. Maintaining safe water and improving quality is a top 
priority as we work to make the City of Flint an attractive place to live, work, study, and play.

PRESS RELEASE: City of Flint Statement on Latest Water Lawsuit 
Water Lawsuit Statement 7.10.15.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Statement on Amended Water Lawsuit 


Flint, Michigan - July 10, 2015 - The Coalition for Clean Water has filed a new lawsuit against the City of Flint 
in which they have abandoned all previous federal claims. In response to the updated complaints, city officials 
issue the following statements: 

"Only one month ago, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit claiming the City violated federal laws. Now they have admitted 
their claims lacked merit, just as the U.S. District Court said. The plaintiffs’ new claims are equally baseless and 
devoid of legal merit. The taxpayers of this community can ill afford yet another lawsuit and any assertion that 
water decisions by the City of Flint were made without the public’s best interest in mind is misleading and 
damaging to the public trust." 

- Pete Bade, City Attorney 

"Every step has been taken to ensure the safety of the water. The City has worked closely with authorities to 
make certain all safety and quality guidelines are followed. Flint’s commitment to providing safe, quality and 
affordable water has not wavered. The City has taken numerous steps and invested a substantial amount, more 
than $30 million over 5 years, to improve its water system. These steps have and will include: 

• Upgrades to the Water Treatment Plant ahead of water source switch 

• Construction of a new intake at the WTP ahead of the KWA connection 

• The regular flushing of hydrants 

• Exercising and repairing of valves 

• Repair of mains damaged during the spring thaw 


l 



• The ongoing hydraulic modeling of the distribution system 

• Creation of both a citizens’ and a technical advisory committee in order to share information with the 
community 

• In-home water testing to monitor distribution system 

• On-site testing for TTHM at the Water Treatment Plant 

• Approval of a leak detection system set to begin in August 

• The creation of a dedicated water webpage, complete with documents and timeline of events, to share 
this information with the public 

In addition, the new granulated activated carbon (GAC) filters are being installed at Flint’s Water Treatment 
Plant. The first round of filters will be installed by mid- July and will have an immediate impact greatly reducing 
the amount of total organic compound (TOC) and thus reducing the formation of trihalomethanes. These filters, 
along with the others proactive measures being undertaken to address issues in the system, were the concurrent 
recommendation of the various parties who evaluated Flint’s treatment operation.

I think this looks good but are we missing an opportunity to shout out all the entities that have stepped 
up to help? GM, Home Depot, etc. etc.? 

If Harvey has the full list, perhaps it could even be attached as an addendum. The point is that a lot of 
people did come together to address the problem, including the private sector and various volunteer 
organizations. I think it says something special about this state rallying to help one of its cities.

Team, 


Please review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint. This 
incorporates some suggested edits to the strong draft from DEQ earlier today. 

Thank you very much. 


Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit 
water provides best protection for public 

health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund 

switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting 
with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, 
Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a 
portion of the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint 
city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation 
donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of 
Environmental Quality today also committed an additional $3.5 million for water 
filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, 
and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in 
drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a 
Wednesday meeting of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the 


2 



Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month 
until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical 
experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for 
children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to 
solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the 
Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public 
health benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to 
fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can be 
present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has 
already fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the 
insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s 
problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in 
Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some 
households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead 
pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue 
to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including 
continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate 
information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 
4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, 
free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will 
be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, 
including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on

cold water tap and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, 
only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula.

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in 
schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples 
spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is 
committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools.

Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and 
filtration as a precaution to protect children. 


In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including 
daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure 
monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer. 

INSERT MAYOR QUOTE HERE 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from 
large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, 
the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using 
phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 




However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

INSERT MOTT FOUNDATION QUOTE HERE 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four 
locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents

Memorandum 
To: Receivership Transition Advisory Board 
From: Natasha L. Henderson, City Administrator 
Date;: Tuesday, October 13 t(i 
Re: Emergency Additions to the; Agenda 

Members of the Receivership Transition Advisory Board: 

This memorandum respectfully requests, the inclusion of two urgent items on the agenda for the October 14 
Receivership Transition Advisory Board Meeting. 

As you may be aware, the Genesee County Health Department has issued a public health advisory in regard to the. high 
amount of lead, contamination in City , water in response to the findings of physicians at Hurley Hospital. This was 
followed by a similar advisory declared by the City, 

Seeking to address this emergency., I requested that the City explore the possibility of ceasing the use of the Flint River 
as the City's water source and to reconnect to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) until the. KiWA 
pipeline can be completed in 2Q16. This request was followed by a recommendation by the Mayor's:. Technical Advisory 
Committee to reconnect to DWSD to improve the City's water quality, thereby safeguarding' public health, On October S, 
2015, the Governor pledged to provide financial assistance to Flint for the. reconnection, in the amount of six million 
dollars, The Mott Foundation graciously Offered to provide an additional four million. Combined with two million dollars 
provided by the City, a total amount of $12 million can be utilized to reconnect the City to DWSD for a nine month 
period.. 

in the Interests of the public health and: welfare, I request that the first, item added to the agenda be a resolution 
(#150872) making available two million dollars from general fund balance to reconnect to DWSD, The second item 
requested to be added, to the agenda is a resolution (#150875) granting the City Administrator the Authority to : enter 
into a contract with DWSD. These items have been attached for your review. 


NMashn L, Henderson 
Cf tv Administrator 


1 apologize for the sudden, request. for changes. to the agenda, however the City is facing a critical emergency requiring 
immediate attention. The Administration has had to react with reflexive speed and remain adaptable to try to mitigate 
the: serious consequences already affecting the. residents of this community. 1 ask that you please consider my request to 
add and. approve these Items; so that we: may address this: emergency in a timely and responsive manner.

Subject: state money for detroit water 

Sara: 

I was at a City Council meeting last night when Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson said the state has only wired 
Flint $2 million of the $6 million approved by the state Legislature. 

She said the city has been told it will receive an additional $2 million in January and another $2 million in April. 
Henderson said she's asked that the money be sent immediately because the city was required to pay Detroit the entire 
$12 million upfront, before the water was reconnected, and its water and sewer fund balance has dropped significantly 
as a result. 

Several council members also spoke about this, and Council President Josh Freeman called the payment plant "beyond 
ridiculous" given the city's financial position. 

Is there someone who can talk to us about this?

RE: nrdc/aclu lawsuit 


Ron, here’s the EPA link to its page on requirements for schools. 1 excerpted and bolded the important 
language. Schools that are part of a municipal supply don’t ha ve separate requirements. Those that ha ve their 
own building water supply are already subject to all the SDWA requirements. 

If there’s a requirement for education and outreach, perhaps DHHS would know. I’ve included them here to 
loop them In. 

Our folks are still looking into this, but the day is growing late. If I come up with something further, I’ ll share it 
along.

Subject: nrdc/aclu lawsuit 

Brad: 

I've asked Dave Murray for a comment on the notice of intent to sue that was filed this morning by the ACLU/NRDC, 
naming officials from the state and city as potential defendants. 

Separate from the story about the potential legal action, I'm following up on an allegation that's specific to the DEQ on 
page 14. 

The notice says the SDWA requires each state to establish a program "to assist" schools and day care centers in "testing 
for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water." 

The notice says test results must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 

It says Michigan does not maintain such a program, which is in violation of SDWA's schools provision. 

Can you or someone from the department talk to me about this claim? 

Thanks,

Good evening, MDHHS friends, 

Here are suggested changes to the press release. I think it's vitally 
important to have our "people first" approach, and be very up front about 
the results. I also think it's important to show up high what we will do with 
this data. Please consider the changes. I also think it's worth a 
conversation about whether we want to release this on a Friday morning. 

This is a challenging situation to be sure, but I think these results are fairly 
encouraging considering some of the heated rhetoric on this issue. 

Thank you, 

Dave

MDHHS releases October data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Results show 24 of 963 people tested had elevated levels 


LANSING, Mich. - Blood lead level testing results released today revealed 
that 24 of 963 adults and children tested in Flint in October had elevated 
levels, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human 
Services. 

MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to 
reach out to families testing with higher levels and help them reduce their 
exposure to lead sources. 

Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 963 children 
and adults between October 1 and October 30. Eighteen people age 17 or 
younger had elevated blood lead levels. Six adults over the age 1 8 were 
identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The report is intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing 
efforts in Flint and provide cumulative total numbers. 

“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. 
Eden Wells, chief medical executive with the MDHHS. “We have made 
progress in testing and identifying those with elevated blood lead levels, and 
the department will continue to work closely with county health department 
to reach these families. We will update these numbers on a regular basis and 
remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the 
total number of elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per 
deciliter, and captures both capillary and venous blood tests. People who 
have had multiple tests are counted only once. The full report is posted 
online at www.michigan.gov/tllntwater and will be updated as more data 
becomes available. 

The testing is part of the state’s action plan to address health concerns 
related to Flint’s water infrastructure. 

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and 
local partners to distribute educational resources and informational letter to 
Flint parents regarding lead testing. GCHD nursing staff are conducting 
direct outreach to families when an elevated blood lead level has been 
detected, serving as an important resources by addressing questions and 
concerns, providing information, and meeting them in their home 
environment. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges 
to Flint residents at four locations including the MDHHS Flint offices and 
the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department. For a full 
list of locations and hours of distribution, visit

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to 
replace the original when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional on 
the MDHHS . YouTube .channel.. For additional updates on Flint water

Residents of Flint, Michigan, to Sue City, State over Lead in Drinking Water 

Natural Resources Defense Council, ACLU of Michigan Start Legal Process to Stop Ongoing Violations of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act 

CHICAGO (November 16, 2015) - Residents of Flint, Mich., together with the ACLU of Michigan and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, today announced their intention to sue state and city officials for ongoing violations of the 
federal Safe Drinking Water Act amid the city’s widespread lead-contamination crisis. A lawsuit would force officials to 
address repeated, systemic failures to follow federal rules designed to protect the public health from dangerous levels of 
lead exposure. 

“The community of Flint is strong and united in our commitment to repair the harm lead exposure has inflicted on our 
children and families. We are taking a stand so that our community can heal the damage that has been done and work 
together so that justice can prevail,” said Pastor Allen Overton, a leader of the Concerned Pastors for Social Action. 

“This action is about holding the government accountable for failing to protect the public health of an entire community,” 
said Anjali Waikar, an environmental justice staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “This case also 
highlights a troubling trend in which the government is willing to cut costs at the expense of its most vulnerable citizens,” 
Waikar said. 

“In their short-sighted effort to save a buck, the leaders who were supposed to be protecting Flint’s citizens instead left 
them exposed to dangerously high levels of lead contamination,” said Michael Steinberg, legal director for the ACLU of 
Michigan. “Not only were the city and state’s actions dangerous and misguided. They were illegal, too.” 

Dangerous amounts of lead leached out of the city’s pipes and into the drinking water of Flint’s homes and schools for 
more than a year following a decision by Flint officials to eschew Detroit's water supply in favor of using the Flint River as 
the City’s primary drinking water source. Not long after the switch, residents began to complain about the smell and 
discoloration of the water and, later, physical ailments stemming from the tainted water. 

Officials working on behalf of Flint insisted for several months that the water was safe. However, water tests conducted by 
experts from Virginia Tech proved those assurances to be wrong, and a study by a local pediatrician that showed that the 


l 



proportion of Flint kids with elevated blood lead levels had doubled since the City switched water sources. After officials 
could no longer deny that the community’s drinking water was contaminated, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder finally conceded 
that Flint should stop using the river water and return to the Detroit water system. 

Despite this move, though, city and state officials have continued to violate federal legal requirements for monitoring and 
sampling tap water for lead, notifying the public about water-testing results and maintaining corrosion control from Flint’s 
lead pipes. 

"So much irreparable harm has been done as a direct result of the failures and lack of oversight perpetrated by the City of 
Flint and Michigan officials who are the very people we relied on to keep us safe. This lawsuit gives me hope that this will 
stop and no other city will have to endure the physical, property, and emotional damage that Flint residents have," said 
Melissa Mays of Water You Fighting For, a Flint-based organization. 

There is no safe level of lead exposure. The toxic effects of lead on virtually every system in the body, and particularly on 
the developing brains of young children, are well documented. It can also contribute to high blood pressure and other 
health problems in adults. Even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and 
academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue was served on behalf of Concerned Pastors for Social Action, an association of religious 
leaders from Flint; Melissa Mays, a Flint resident; the ACLU of Michigan; and the Natural Resources Defense Council. 

The groups assert that since April 2014, the City of Flint and Michigan state officials have failed to monitor and control for 
lead in Flint’s drinking water and maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with lead testing and remediation, in 
violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. If City of Flint and Michigan state officials - including Governor Rick 
Snyder and Dan Wyant, Director of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality - do not remedy violations under the 
Safe Drinking Water Act within sixty days, the groups intend to file a lawsuit in federal court. 

Flint and state officials have known since 201 1 that choosing the Flint River as a drinking water source could result in lead 
contamination issues, due to its highly corrosive properties. Yet state and city officials insisted that the water was safe to 
drink - even after testing found dangerously high lead levels in some residents’ tap water. Citizen concerns about high 
lead levels were dismissed by state and city officials as “near hysterical]” and “irresponsible,” despite well-established 
evidence that there is no safe level of lead exposure, and that even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to 
affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue is required under the Safe Drinking Water Act as a prerequisite to filing suit.

Sorry for the delay. It's been a bit more crazy busy than normal. 


On this lawsuit, we haven't been served yet so can't comment on specific details. What would say is that we're focused 
on moving forward and ensuring public health and clean, safe drinking water. The governor has outlined a detailed 
multiple step action plan for both immediate, mid and long term. He has also appointed a task force doing a very 
important job of reviewing all past actions. They are a bipartisan group of people of the highest integrity, experts in their 
fields and widely respected who are going to do a very thorough, objective review. 


Just let me know if anything more needed at all.

Residents of Flint, Michigan, to Sue City, State over Lead in Drinking Water 

Natural Resources Defense Council, ACLU of Michigan Start Legal Process to Stop Ongoing Violations of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act 

CHICAGO (November 16, 2015) - Residents of Flint, Mich., together with the ACLU of Michigan and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, today announced their intention to sue state and city officials for ongoing violations of the 
federal Safe Drinking Water Act amid the city’s widespread lead-contamination crisis. A lawsuit would force officials to 
address repeated, systemic failures to follow federal rules designed to protect the public health from dangerous levels of 
lead exposure. 

“The community of Flint is strong and united in our commitment to repair the harm lead exposure has inflicted on our 
children and families. We are taking a stand so that our community can heal the damage that has been done and work 
together so that justice can prevail,” said Pastor Allen Overton, a leader of the Concerned Pastors for Social Action. 

“This action is about holding the government accountable forfaiting to protect the public health of an entire community,” 
said Anjali Waikar, an environmental justice staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “This case also 
highlights a troubling trend in which the government is willing to cut costs at the expense of its most vulnerable citizens,” 
Waikar said. 

“In their short-sighted effort to save a buck, the leaders who were supposed to be protecting Flint’s citizens instead left 
them exposed to dangerously high levels of lead contamination,” said Michael Steinberg, legal director for the ACLU of 
Michigan. “Not only were the city and state’s actions dangerous and misguided. They were illegal, too.” 

Dangerous amounts of lead leached out of the city’s pipes and into the drinking water of Flint’s homes and schools for 
more than a year following a decision by Flint officials to eschew Detroit's water supply in favor of using the Flint River as 
the City’s primary drinking water source. Not long after the switch, residents began to complain about the smell and 
discoloration of the water and, later, physical ailments stemming from the tainted water. 

Officials working on behalf of Flint insisted for several months that the water was safe. However, water tests conducted by 
experts from Virginia Tech proved those assurances to be wrong, and a study by a local pediatrician that showed that the 
proportion of Flint kids with elevated blood lead levels had doubled since the City switched water sources. After officials 
could no longer deny that the community’s drinking water was contaminated, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder finally conceded 
that Flint should stop using the river water and return to the Detroit water system.

Despite this move, though, city and state officials have continued to violate federal legal requirements for monitoring and 
sampling tap water for lead, notifying the public about water-testing results and maintaining corrosion control from Flint’s 
lead pipes. 

"So much irreparable harm has been done as a direct result of the failures and lack of oversight perpetrated by the City of 
Flint and Michigan officials who are the very people we relied on to keep us safe. This lawsuit gives me hope that this will 
stop and no other city will have to endure the physical, property, and emotional damage that Flint residents have," said

Subject: FW: Flint water school testing results - TODAY 

Importance: High 

Please see below and attached release per brief convo at senior staff. Sill no exact word on timing of 
blood lead level data from DHHS - hopefully by late this week. 

DEQ also has video that they'll be using for some footage of the testing with TV stations. Link here:

Freeman Elementary water testing shows 
lead exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water 
testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling 
results from Freeman Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even 
individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, 
schools and other buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan 
Coordinator. “Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or 
plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing 
from the state.” 


i 



Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty- 
two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high 
results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or 
plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated 
for several minutes, lead levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, 
systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and 
fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized 
flushing regimen. The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing 
period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so 
we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related 
components where high lead levels were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. 
“Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the 
water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our students. 
Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all stakeholders to 
make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how 
sampling was conducted, visit www.michigan.gov/fijntwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will 
soon be available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the 
Flint Community Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools 
and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took 
advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 
percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and 
more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead 
service lines or in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can 
make it difficult for homeowners and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all 
residents can do is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable 
information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, 
or by emailing fiintwater@cityoffiint.com . 

For more information about water samples received through the state’s free testing program, 
visit vvww.michigan.gov/flinfwater.

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and 
Regulatory Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain 
a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of 
plumbing materials are used. The assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the 
school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified 
faucets and fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, 
followed by a 30-second flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then 
the fourth sample. These samples provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or 
around each specific faucet and fountain as well as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the 
school. These 1-liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the 
impact of any lead sources deep in the building’s plumbing.

I believe you had indicated you had a meeting on this tomorrow, yes? 

We need to touch base and get all facts on this situation ASAP. Turning into unfortunate and unnecessary PR issue that 
we're trying to work with Treasury and DEQto be on top of, stem, find resolution, etc. 

Please call our office today to connect with Dave (as our lead on this) or myself or Jarrod if he's not available for some 
reason. 

Thanks much,

Emergency Manager Statement on Water: Spending Extra $12 Million on Detroit Water 

“Incomprehensible” When Flint Water Just as Safe 

Flint, Michigan - March 24, 2015 - At the City Council meeting held on Monday, March 23, 2015, Flint City 
Council made a motion to “do all things necessary” to return to using water purchased from Detroit and 
discontinue use of the Flint River as a water source. The following statement from Emergency Manager Gerald

“Flint water today is safe by all EPA and MDEQ standards and the City is working daily to improve its quality. 
Users also pay some of the highest rates in the state because of the decreased numbers of users and the age of 
the system. 

“It is incomprehensible to me that 7 members of the Flint City Council would want to send more than $12 
million a year to the system serving southeast Michigan, even if Flint rate payers could afford it. Water from 
Detroit is no safer than water from Flint.

This direction of discussion also deviates from what, in my judgment, should be the focus: How 
can we not only operate and maintain a system to assure the delivery of safe and quality water 
dependably, but significantly reduce the cost of water and sewer to the users? At an average of 
$149 per month for water and sewer service for a residential user, the cost is extremely high in 
comparison to surrounding areas, as well as most areas across the state, and creates a significant 
financial burden for many users. In my judgment, we should all be concentrating on how to reduce 
rates by 50% or more. Unfortunately, there are no easy or evident answers, and continuation of 
the status will be an impediment to the sustainable recovery of the City of Flint. It is a conversation 
that I expect we will have with the recently created Water Quality Advisory Committee. 

My reasoning for this conclusion is as follows: 

One of the decisions made in the context of beginning to eliminate deficits and to restore financial 
stability to the City of Flint was to increase water and sewer rates significantly - the only choice 
available to financially stabilize a system that as of June 30, 2012, had a deficit of $8,758,091. 
Another was to leave DWDS for the KWA because it offered the opportunity to lower future rate 
increases. A third decision was to utilize the Flint River on an interim basis when DWSD 
unilaterally terminated the City’s contract for water purchase. That decision was made because it 
also offered an immediate cost savings opportunity which translated into the ability to upgrade the 
Water Treatment Plant without having to seek financing. It was a reasonable decision because of 
our experience in using the river in a back-up capacity, including test runs on a quarterly basis for 
several decades. 

Unfortunately, the switch to the river as a primary source was more challenging than anticipated, 
and the harsh winter of 20 1 3-20 1 4 resulted in much more damage to the aging water infrastructure 
than in previous years. The result was the issuance of required notices that water exceeded 
established guidelines for safety as it could affect certain vulnerable populations, and some users 
of the system experienced unpleasant odors and discoloration. Some users also appeared to have 
had some negative reactions to the new source of water. However, as soon as the test results were 
known. City staff took immediate actions to address the concerns. These actions are evidenced 
today by the fact that MDEQ has certified that our most recent testing shows water from all testing 
sites to be well within acceptable guidelines. Additionally, the City is continuing to taking the 
necessary actions to assure that the water supply remains safe and that water quality continues to 
improve. 

As the City has moved to address the situation, the suggestion continues to be made that the City 
should re-engage with DWSD and purchase water at least until the KWA pipeline is supplying 
water. As evidenced by the most recent letter from DWSD, such a decision would immediately 
increase the City’s cost by $846,700 per month, or $10,160,400 per year, just for the fixed cost 
portion of the price. The actual purchase of water would be an additional fee, and dependent upon 



Wayne Workman 
March 3, 2015 
Page 3 


the quantity purchased. We estimate the actual water purchase cost to average more than $ 1 million 
per month, for a grand total of approximately $22 million per year. Finally, the DWSD offer is 
conditioned upon the City (or presumably the KWA) agreeing to negotiate a long term contract 
(30 years) for back-up. 

The $22 million annual estimate of increased costs to purchase water from DWSD would be 
minimally offset by an approximate $3 million in reduced operating costs, and could be further 
offset by an additional $9 million, but only if all funding for capital improvements to the system 
are eliminated. To eliminate all funding dedicated to repairing, stabilizing, and improving the 
system would be totally irresponsible and would have long term negative consequences to the City 
and to future rate payers. 


As you are aware we have recently brought in outside expert assistance to evaluate the steps we 
have taken to assure that the water is safe and to continue to improve water quality. We are 
expecting specific recommendations within the next few weeks, and are committed to 
implementing those recommendations in a timely manner. Many steps have already been taken. I 
am confident that implementing their recommendations will assure a continuing supply of safe 
water as well as improved quality, and at far less cost than re-engaging DWSD. 

We have also created a 40-member Water Advisory Committee and a 13-member Technical 
Advisory Committee to assure two-way communication with the public and users of the system. 
Those committees will begin to meet this week, and we look forward to answering their questions 
and receiving their input. 

It is unfortunate that problems and concerns with quality have arisen, and we are working every 
day to address the issues that caused them. Maintaining safe water and improving quality is a top 
priority as we work to make the City of Flint an attractive place to live, work, study, and play.

Flint, Michigan -March 24, 2015 - At the City Council meeting held on Monday, March 23, 2015, Flint City 
Council made a motion to “do all things necessary” to return to using water purchased from Detroit and

“It is incomprehensible to me that 7 members of the Flint City Council would want to send more than $12

sustainabie basis. The steps taken over the past fhteeyeaM have beers difficult. Taxes and fees have 
been raised, servicesand workforce redrseed, avid; ongoing costs, including legacy costs, have been 
constrained. 

Hie emtent controversy surrounding the provision of water, and the path for resolution, has a 
potentially significant impact: on the: progress that is being made. I am satisfied that the water 
provided So Flint users today is within all MDEQ and EPA guidelines, as evidenced by the most

water safety and to improve water ;^svuce this eormtufment

City should return to DWSD, even for a short period of time, 
Would,, in mv judgment, have extremely negative dmucial conseguenees to the water system, and 
consequently to the rate payers. By the most conservative estimates, such a move would increase 
costs by at least $12 millioxr annually, with that amount achieved only by eliminating virtually all 
budgeted imptpyemcm the system. For a system with Unrestricted Assets ofonly $740,745, 
according to the June 30, 2014 audited financial statements, the only recourse within ihevCity'S

Subject: Flint Water Issue - Rep. Kildee Letter Received By Federal Agencies 
Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Introducing Makayla* 


• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last 
week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns. 

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west 
side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with 
warm tap water. 

• Physical exam and development are normal. Makayla 
receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine lead and 
hemoglobin screening. 

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/dL. 



^Hypothetical scenario 


Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL... 


Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are considered 
elevated blood lead levels (EBL) 

Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead level 

Disproportionately impacts low income, minority 
children 

Primary prevention is most important 



Primary Prevention 


• "Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear 
to be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental 
and housing policies should encourage 
PREVENTION of all exposure to lead " 


"Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention " 2012 
CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. 



What will happen to Makayla? 


• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

- Decrease in IQ 

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

- Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low IQs 
(<70) 

• Implications for special education services, employment, 
incarceration, life achievement, etc

retardation and cardiovascular diseases from environmental lead 
exposure. Environmental Research, 2004. 94:120-33. 



Behavioral Burden 


Increased likelihood of : 

— ADHD behaviors 

— Delinquent behaviors and arrests 

— Total arrests and increased rates of arrests 
involving violent offenses 

— Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular, 
immunologic, endocrine, etc

The Cost 


"For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as well 
as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) in 
lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure." 


"The present value of Michigan's economic losses attributable to lead 
exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. 
blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per 
year in loss of future lifetime earnings."

Lead in Water 


• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in controlling 
other sources. 

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in water 
sources, disinfectant uses, etc 

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable 
formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers 

— For about 25% o f infants drinking formula made from tap water at 10 
ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5 
micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL). 

- Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights

lead in children. Journal of Water and Health, doi: 10.2166/wh. 2013. 067 58-68 (2014). 

Edwards, M. Fetal Death and Reduced Birth Rates Associated with Exposure to Lead-Contaminated Drinking Water. Env. Sci. and Tech. 2013 DOI: 
10.1021/es4034952 



Preliminary Results 



Conclusions from BLL analysis 


% of children with EBL in Flint has increased 

— Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water 
lead levels 

Results underestimate risk: infants not screened 
for lead and water usage unknown. 

— Accurate exposure largely unknown since national 
childhood lead screening focuses on household lead 
exposure (paint, soil, dust) at later ages (1 and 2 yrs) 


Results are consistent and concerning. Primary 
prevention has failed. 



Next Steps 


Immediately limit further exposure 

— Encourage breast feeding 

— No tap water for high risk groups: infants on formula & 
pregnant mothers 

— Declare health advisory: allows WIC to administer water or 
ready-to-feed formula and other resources (Salvation Army 
& United Way water supplies) 

— Distribution of lead clearing NSF-approved filters 

— Public education regarding precautions (flushing, etc) 

— Re-connect to Lake Huron water source ASAP 



And Makayla 


Asymptomatic now 

But what will her future hold 
and an entire generation of 
Flint children?

Subject: Flint Water Issue - Rep. Kildee Letter Received By Federal Agencies 

Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig 
Fugate of FEMA, HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, 
Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated 
with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he 
called me about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they 
need to work through the local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are 
working through the local health department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs 
water or want water the first step is to handle it locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any 

l 



gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local EM has done in this regard. I will be 
with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, this week if they have 
questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DFIHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Subject: Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update - FOIA EXEMPT AND 
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED 

The Flint Drinking Water Action Plan was announced on October 2, 201 5. It included 
the following: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately 

• Offered free water testing to Flint residents 

• Provided free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state 
assistance programs 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes 

• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

• Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint drinking water public health advisor 

• Boosted a comprehensive lead education program 


Testing in Flint Public Schools Immediatel 



Samples were taken on October 2 and were received at DEQ laboratory over the 
weekend. Test results to date indicate 37 samples tested, 4 of which exceeded a 
federal action level, and 1 of those 4 was a significant outlier. We will be compiling 
detailed information about which schools and area codes the test results came from and 
will be providing that information in our next update. 

We have met with DHHS, and we are working on developing response protocols, a 
communications plan, and guidance for schools when this data is reported. 

Offered Free Water Testing to Flint Residents 


We have received 4 sets of samples from Flint that represent individual residents. We 
will be compiling the total number and the results of those samples and reporting in a 
future report. 

Provided Free Water Filters to Residents with Concerns or Who are Included in State 
Assistance Programs 


DHHS held organizational meetings in Flint on October 5, and filter distribution by 
DHHS started on October 6. Nick Lyon in DHHS is taking the lead in filter distribution. 

Expanding Health Exposure Testing of Individual Homes 

Dr. Wells and Dan Wyant have been in conversations about a protocol for exposure 
testing. Dr. Wells will take the lead on developing the protocol. 

Accelerating Corrosion Controls in the Flint Drinking Water System 

A conference call was held with U.S. EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman 
and national corrosion control experts. We asked two questions: 

1 Which is a safer water source - DWSD or Flint River? 

2. If you don’t have an opinion on the safer source, what criteria should we 
use for an evaluation? 

EPA staff would not commit to a preference, but their evaluation of the criteria 
clearly lead to the conclusion that DWSD was a safer water source. EPA 
committed to submitting technical assistance to the Safe Drinking Water 
Technical Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) meeting, which will be held 
on October 7 at 2:00 p.m. in Flint City Hall. 

DEQ met with the Flint Mayor, the city manager, and their water staff. Flint agreed 
to expediting corrosion controls. We discussed the agenda for the Advisory 
Committee meeting. The Advisory Committee will be asked to evaluate two 
respective water sources at their Wednesday meeting. 

We expect the Advisory Committee to recommend the water source that would 
address not only lead safety but also other water safety issues. 

Accelerating Water System Improvements to Address Replacing Lead Service Lines 


2 



Conversations with Congressman Kildee and EPA have clarified the state would be 
allowed to use Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds to replace private drinking water 
service lines. Senator Ananich has been approached to introduce language clarifying 
the state’s authority. 

Expediting the Completion of the Kareqnondi Water Authority Pipeline 

Dan Wyant has talked to Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright. Mr. Wright 
has provided a list of issues that would help expedite the completion of the Karegnondi 
Water Authority pipeline. They include truck weight and frost law exemptions, talent 
identification, and expediting permits. 

Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

EPA has appointed their national technical expert to the Advisory Committee, and we 
have appointed Alfred Franzblau, M.D., Professor of Environmental Health Services, 
University of Michigan, to the Advisory Committee. 

Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor 


Boosted a Comprehensive Lead Education Program 


Other Updates 

• Dan Wyant was interviewed on October 6 by CBS Evening News during filter 
distribution in Flint. Questions asked were: 

o Was it a mistake to go to Flint River water? 

Answer: We draw water from the surface waters; we treat it to safe 
drinking water standards. At issue is lead exposure. Lead exposure must 
be addressed. Actions are being taken to address the issue, 
o Did you put kids at risk? 

Answer: Lead exposure is a serious issue, and steps need to be taken to 
limit lead exposure, 
o Why did it take so long? 

Answer: DEQ has been there from the beginning addressing the issue of 
Flint water. Recent tests justify and require the actions taken. Action 
steps address short-term, intermediate, and long-term lead issues to 
ensure public safety and confidence of the drinking water. 

• Dan Wyant also spoke to the Governor about Flint funding needs. A meeting is 
scheduled for October 7 at 8:00 a.m. to further discuss proposals. 

• What we are telling Flint citizens is: 

o Have your water tested 

o Use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and preparing formula 
o Run water before use if it has not been used for several hours 
o Obtain a water filter approved for lead removal 
o Purchase lead-free plumbing components 
o Remove entire lead service lines

Team, 

Please review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint. This incorporates some 
suggested edits to the strong draft from DEQ earlier today. 

Thank you very much. 


Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 
million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million 
and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental 
Quality today also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health 
exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from 
large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, 
the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using 
phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

2 


To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in 
water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are 
available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 
Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., 
Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about 
proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 
p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap 
and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at

I think this looks good but are we missing an opportunity to shout out all the entities that have stepped 
up to help? GM, Home Depot, etc. etc.? 

If Harvey has the full list, perhaps it could even be attached as an addendum. The point is that a lot of 
people did come together to address the problem, including the private sector and various volunteer 
organizations. I think it says something special about this state rallying to help one of its cities.

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public 
health benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to 
fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can be 
present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has 
already fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the 
insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s 
problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in 
Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some 
households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead 
pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue 
to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including 
continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate 
information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 
4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, 
free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will 
be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, 
including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on 
Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the 
cold water tap and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, 
only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in 
schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples 
spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion. 


However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is 
committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. 

Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and 
filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including 
daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 


Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available

Greetings, Rona - 

Just got back from Flint Various versions of this Q came up during today's presser. 1 would recommend you take a listen. 
http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/Q,46G8,7-277-6Q112-2S372Q--,QQ.btmi 

State was following all nationally set standards and protocols for testing, and has some of the most dedicated and 
professional drinking water and public health experts in the country working off the best information available at the 
time. We have acted quickly and took detailed concrete actions steps as new information and data came in.

Subject: Looking for comment 

WWJ's Zahra Huber spoke with Professor Marc Edwards from Virginia Tech regarding his thoughts on the Flint Water 
situation as the lead researcher on the project and he had very harsh words about how the Flint Water situation had 
been handled. He said federal laws had been broken when the switch was made away from the Detroit River to the Flint 
River and that data was manipulated to show that Flint water was safe when it was not. Can we get a comment from the 
Governor on this interview? I've attached the audio, uncut, for you to listen to for comment. 

Let us know. Thanks!

Sara: 

I was at a City Council meeting last night when Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson said the state has only wired 
Flint $2 million of the $6 million approved by the state Legislature. 

She said the city has been told it will receive an additional $2 million in January and another $2 million in April. 
Henderson said she's asked that the money be sent immediately because the city was required to pay Detroit the entire 
$12 million upfront, before the water was reconnected, and its water and sewer fund balance has dropped significantly 
as a result. 

Several council members also spoke about this, and Council President Josh Freeman called the payment plant "beyond 
ridiculous" given the city's financial position. 

Is there someone who can talk to us about this?

* The initial agreement and understanding was for monthly payments. 

® Unbeknownst to the state, the city entered into an arrangement for one upfront sum and payment. 

• Now that we are aware of this and have confirmed that final arrangement, the state is taking steps to immediately

Importance: High 

Please see below and attached release per brief convo at senior staff. Sill no exact word on timing of blood lead level 
data from DHHS - hopefully by late this week. 

DEQ also has video that they'll be using for some footage of the testing with TV stations. Link here: 

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 


i 



Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
conducted, visit www.michigan.qov/fiintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.” 

T esting is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 81 0-787-6537 and pressing 1 , or by emailing 

flintwater@cityoffynt.com . 

For more information about water samples received through the state’s free testing program, visit 

www. michigan . qov/fiintvvater. 

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 
assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 


2 



provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 


On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

Sorry for the delay. It's been a bit more crazy busy than normal. 

On this lawsuit, we haven't been served yet so can't comment on specific details. What would say is that we're focused 
on moving forward and ensuring public health and clean, safe drinking water. The governor has outlined a detailed 
multiple step action plan for both immediate, mid and long term. He has also appointed a task force doing a very 
important job of reviewing all past actions. They are a bipartisan group of people of the highest integrity, experts in their

Residents of Flint, Michigan, to Sue City, State over Lead in Drinking Water 


l 



Natural Resources Defense Council, ACLU of Michigan Start Legal Process to Stop Ongoing Violations of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act 

CHICAGO (November 16, 2015) - Residents of Flint, Mich., together with the ACLU of Michigan and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, today announced their intention to sue state and city officials for ongoing violations of the 
federal Safe Drinking Water Act amid the city’s widespread lead-contamination crisis. A lawsuit would force officials to 
address repeated, systemic failures to follow federal rules designed to protect the public health from dangerous levels of 
lead exposure. 

“The community of Flint is strong and united in our commitment to repair the harm lead exposure has inflicted on our 
children and families. We are taking a stand so that our community can heal the damage that has been done and work 
together so that justice can prevail,” said Pastor Allen Overton, a leader of the Concerned Pastors for Social Action. 

“This action is about holding the government accountable forfaiting to protect the public health of an entire community,” 
said Anjali Waikar, an environmental justice staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “This case also 
highlights a troubling trend in which the government is willing to cut costs at the expense of its most vulnerable citizens,” 
Waikar said. 

“In their short-sighted effort to save a buck, the leaders who were supposed to be protecting Flint’s citizens instead left 
them exposed to dangerously high levels of lead contamination,” said Michael Steinberg, legal director for the ACLU of 
Michigan. “Not only were the city and state’s actions dangerous and misguided. They were illegal, too.” 

Dangerous amounts of lead leached out of the city’s pipes and into the drinking water of Flint’s homes and schools for 
more than a year following a decision by Flint officials to eschew Detroit's water supply in favor of using the Flint River as 
the City’s primary drinking water source. Not long after the switch, residents began to complain about the smell and 
discoloration of the water and, later, physical ailments stemming from the tainted water. 

Officials working on behalf of Flint insisted for several months that the water was safe. However, water tests conducted by 
experts from Virginia Tech proved those assurances to be wrong, and a study by a local pediatrician that showed that the 
proportion of Flint kids with elevated blood lead levels had doubled since the City switched water sources. After officials 
could no longer deny that the community’s drinking water was contaminated, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder finally conceded 
that Flint should stop using the river water and return to the Detroit water system. 

Despite this move, though, city and state officials have continued to violate federal legal requirements for monitoring and 
sampling tap water for lead, notifying the public about water-testing results and maintaining corrosion control from Flint’s 
lead pipes. 

"So much irreparable harm has been done as a direct result of the failures and lack of oversight perpetrated by the City of 
Flint and Michigan officials who are the very people we relied on to keep us safe. This lawsuit gives me hope that this will 
stop and no other city will have to endure the physical, property, and emotional damage that Flint residents have," said 
Melissa Mays of Water You Fighting For, a Flint-based organization. 

There is no safe level of lead exposure. The toxic effects of lead on virtually every system in the body, and particularly on 
the developing brains of young children, are well documented. It can also contribute to high blood pressure and other 
health problems in adults. Even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and 
academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue was served on behalf of Concerned Pastors for Social Action, an association of religious 
leaders from Flint; Melissa Mays, a Flint resident; the ACLU of Michigan; and the Natural Resources Defense Council. 

The groups assert that since April 2014, the City of Flint and Michigan state officials have failed to monitor and control for 
lead in Flint’s drinking water and maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with lead testing and remediation, in 
violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. If City of Flint and Michigan state officials - including Governor Rick 
Snyder and Dan Wyant, Director of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality - do not remedy violations under the 
Safe Drinking Water Act within sixty days, the groups intend to file a lawsuit in federal court. 

Flint and state officials have known since 201 1 that choosing the Flint River as a drinking water source could result in lead 
contamination issues, due to its highly corrosive properties. Yet state and city officials insisted that the water was safe to 
drink - even after testing found dangerously high lead levels in some residents’ tap water. Citizen concerns about high 
lead levels were dismissed by state and city officials as “near hysterical]” and “irresponsible,” despite well-established 


2 



evidence that there is no safe level of lead exposure, and that even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to 
affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue is required under the Safe Drinking Water Act as a prerequisite to filing suit.

Hi Sara: 

I've attached a copy of a letter Congressman Kildee sent to Gov. Snyder last week concerning Flint water issues. 
I didn't know if there has been a formal reply and/or if you would want to comment on it.

Governor Rick Snyder 
Executive Office of the Governor 
P.O, Box 30013 
Lansing, Michigan 4S9G9 


Governor Snyder: 

I would like to provide you an update with some of the work we are doing in response to your 
letter on October 2, 201 5 letter. I also have three requests of the state that are necessary to 
provide relief to the victims of the Flint water crisis. 

First, Senator Stabenow, Senator Peters and I wrote a letter to the IDS. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EFA) asking for clarification on whether federal Saw penults states to use Safe Drinking 
Water State Revolving Funds (Revolving Funds) to finance the replacement of privately owned 
lead water service lines (attached). The EPA responded that the Revolving Funds can in fact be 
used for this purpose. My office immediately notified both your office and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality of this fact 

Secondly, the three of us also wrote to Secretary Tom Vilsack requesting that the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide greater clarification on the availability of “Ready to 
Feed” formula for recipients of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (W1C) in Flint, Additionally, the letter asks to identify resources to improve the 
nutrition of Flint residents specifically as it relates to lead, because a certain diet can reduce 
some of the impact of exposure. The USDA is currently reviewing the letter. 

Third, I have been working with the EPA on important revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule 
that would prevent a public health crisis like the one in Flint from happening again in other 
communities. I will be providing testimony at a meeting of the National Drinking Water 
Advisory Council next Wednesday, November 18 on what we have learned firsthand in Flint and 
the necessary' improvements to the Lead and Copper Rule. 



I will continue to pursue all of these avenues in order to find assistance for the people of Flint, 
There are, however, additional steps that need to he taken to remediate the damage done to the 
people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of 
Flint' s Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available, I urge state and local partners to 
work in coordination to fulfill the following requests, 

* Firsf I request that the state of Michigan use its Revolving Funds and other state 
resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair the damage done to Flint’s 
water distribution system. 

Due to the corrosive nature of the water, conservative estimates show there has been hundreds of 
millions of dollars of damage done to Flint 5 s water distribution system. The damage to the 
system will increase maintenance costs resnlting in higher rates for Flint water users, who 
already are burdened by the highest water rates in the state. Furthermore, the presence of over 
15,000 lead service lines continues to threaten the quality of the water and creates the potential 
for future lead exposure through drinking water. As stated previously, the EFA has said that 
using the Revolving Funds for this purpose is allowed under federal law, and 1 request the state 
do so, 

* Second, I request the state create a fund for ongoing assistance to the people of Flint to 
respond to the impacts of lead exposure. 

The effects of lead are serious and permanent, with especially harmful impacts on young 
children and those with weakened immune systems. In discussions with health professionals, 
they have expressed the need for significant investments in the local, health system in order to 
respond to the widespread exposure of lead to tire people of Flint, including monitoring of figure 
lead exposure. Tills fund should include support for, at a minimum, continuous health 
monitoring, early education programs, nutrition education, support sendees for children to 
succeed in school, and continued exposure prevention efforts. The investments we make now to 
combat the negative impacts of lead exposure will pay dividends in avoided costs in the future. 

* Finally, 1 again ask that the state immediately reverse course and rescind Flint’s 
obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting to the Detroit water system 
and refund any money the city' of Flint has had to pay. 

Requiring a financially distressed city and its people to pay for the state’s failures is an 
abdication of dear responsibility' by the state. The state-appointed emergency manager was in 
charge of the city of Flint during the time that die decision to leave the Detroit system was made. 
;The state - not Flint ■ ■ created this water crisis, and the State needs to pay to fix it. The $2 million 
Flint spent to reconnect to the Detroit water system could he used for many other essential 
services in Flint, such as hiring policemen and firefighters, improving schools and maintaining 



In addition to state investments, I encourage the state to request assistance from federal agencies. 
They have extensive experience working with health, education and nutrition systems nationwide 
and could provide critical resources to state officials. Specifically, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention has offered resources if the state requests it. 1 will work to support any 
efforts for federal assistance the state makes. 

I look forward to working with the state and federal governments to not only provide clean 
drinking water to the people of Flint immediately, but also repair the damage done to the city’s 
water system and give local health professionals the resources they need to combat die long term 
impacts of lead exposure. 


Sincerely, 



Dan Kildce

Governor Snyder, 


The recent water concern in the City of Flint has revealed two actions for future drinking water 
shortages. 

In the past, the Flint area has used the National Guard water tanker for local road races. Also, daily 
water tankers fill our local swimming pools. 

When we have large numbers of citizens that must use the "Boil the Water" process, why can't we use 
the tankers I mentioned above? 

Flint has gone days without drinking water. 

With such a basic life need, let's try some possible solutions! We could dispense the water at Senior 
Centers, community gathering locations, neighborhood schools and churches. This could be seen as a 
training experience for the National Guard or Reserves. 

Governor, the need is there and the tankers are at hand. 

Thanks for your time and please let me know what you think. 

I hope this note finds you and your family in fine health. 



Genesee County Clerk 
John J. Gleason

RE: FEMA request 


I need to get something to Cong. Dingeii and Cong, Levin if we want their help in this. ! can't keep them in the dark and 
expect that they will jump up and say ok without seeing the request. I need some lead time before it is filed so they feel 
included. The two of them can get this done on their own with Carl if we just help them.

Dennis, 

There is some information attached on the Flint water issue you asked us about. I summarize a few of the key 

points: 

• The water system has been running at deficits for years. When the previous EFM left the City in 2004, the 
water system has a reserve of approximately $60 million. When Mike Brown was appointed, this had turned 
into a $20 million deficit due to years of not passing along to consumers the rate increases of over 10% 
hitting the system from DWSD. Slides 5 & 6 of the attached power point show this pretty dramatically. 

• Substantial increases over the past few years are an attempt to reflect the actual costs of running the system. 

• Another concern raised by DHS was the increase in the deposit for rental properties. This was necessary 
because renters paid the previous $100 deposit, then racked up water bills in excess of this amount and 
walked away. Of the affidavits currently out there, 82% are past due. I would also note that this is not 
mandatory, it is only required if a landlord is not willing to put the water bill in their name. 

• The bottom line is that they realize it is an issue, but the General Fund doesn’t have the money to run 
general City operations, much less subsidize water rates. 

The two page word document (attached) provided by the EFM gives you a good overview of what is going on. 

They believe that a switch to KWA is part of the solution for high water rates in the City.

City Of Flint Water History Facts 


Current Treatment Plant was put into service in 1954. 

Current 72” main pipeline was completed in 1970. 

Flint signed a 30 year contract with Detroit Water and Sewer Department in the mid 1 960’s. 

The contract with DWSD has expired and we are currently operating on a yearly extension. 

In 2006 Flint completed a $48,000,000 upgrade of the existing Water Plant (required by the MDEQ & for backup only). 

Flint’s Water & Sewer System is approximately a $300,000,000 Enterprise. 

Flint’s Water & Sewer System is designed to deliver water to over 200,000 people with over 1 ,500 miles of infrastructure. 
Flint’s most recent census count shows a population of approximately 1 02,000 in 201 0. 

Flint’s census population in 2000 was approximately 124,000. 

The water system had over 45,000 customers in June of 1999. 

The water system had just over 36,000 customers by June 2011 . 

The “Fixed Costs” that must be covered to maintain the system and deliver quality water have increased over time.

Response to Treasury regarding water rates, etc. 


The cost of water and sewer in the City of Flint has become one of the most vexing issues 
facing the Emergency Financial Manager. When the Emergency Manager was appointed 
in December 2011 the water system had a $20 million deficit. In order to address this 
deficit the EM was forced to increase water and sewer rates by over a combined 120% in 
the past 18 months. 

When the previous EFM left the City in 2004, the water system has a reserve of 
approximately $60 million. In the intervening years several things occurred: for three of 
five years (2007-2011) no rate increases were passed along to customers even though 
Detroit charged increases of over 10% per year; in the years when increases were passed 
along those amounts did not equal the actual cost of the system; the City chose to use the 
equity built up in the Water and Sewer funds until that was no longer available; a large 
lawsuit was settled; the City must pay for the $48 million MDEQ upgrades required at 
the Water Treatment Plant; and unbilled or unpaid water and sewer charges increased 
significantly. 

In the past 18 months water and sewer rates have been increased to reflect the actual costs 
to operate the water and sewer system. Major leaks in the distribution system have been 
repaired. Unpaid water and sewer usage is now being addressed and the water affidavit 
process is part of this problem. 

The City of Flint currently allows landlords to put the water and sewer billing in the name 
of the renter. This affidavit process holds the landlord harmless for any water costs. The 
deposit for the affidavit has been set at $100, which is the lowest in the County. The 
deposit fees in the County range from a low of $100 to a high of $500. The City is 
raising its rate to $350, which puts us about in the middle of the range. Depending on 
usage, this will cover 60 to 90 days’ water charges and reduce the amount of uncollected 
billing. Keep in mind, any water not paid for is eventually charged to those who do pay 
through increased rates. 

Because the deposit is so low in relation to the current charges, renters quickly owe more 
than the deposit, and find it easier to simply walk away from the rental and forfeit the 
deposit. This results in the City being on the hook for the unpaid bills. Currently there 
are 4,893 affidavits, and 4029 of them (82%) past due. This facctor alone totals to just 
under $3 million. In addition, when the renter walks away, the City has no way of 
knowing that the property is vacant. Many times the landlord rents the property again, 
without filing an affidavit, and the water continues to be charged to the former renter, 
again adding uncollected bills to the City. In the past the collection rate for past due 
accounts, when turned over to a collection agency, has been about 3% on average. Keep 
in mind that this is a deposit, not a fee, and can be refunded when the renter leaves the 
property. Also, the landlord can avoid the renter’s deposit requirement by keeping the 
water and sewer billing in his name. 

The City is also studying the potential to hold the landlord accountable for the water 
charges under certain conditions, such as failure to notify the City when a renter leaves 
and then renting the property again without filiing a new affidavit. 



The City recognizes that the high cost of water is a factor which is causing low income 
residents to choose to leave the City and the increase in the deposit fee might accelerate 
that choice. However, many of the surrounding communities charge a higher deposit than 
does the City o Flint. Renters are leaving the City because they can get better housing for 
less money, live in safer neighborhoods with better schools, have their water charges 
decrease by about half, and have their insurance rates reduced by approximately 50%. 

Water and sewer costs have resulted in about 8,000 current customers to be more than 60 
days past due. Many are senior citizens who have lived in Flint their entire life, paid their 
taxes, etc. and now find themselves unable to pay their water bill. This concerns the City 
more than the issue of deposits. We have put in place for this year the ability for citizens 
to direct a part of their city tax refund to help people with their water bills, and we are 
reviewing other options as well as scheduled meetings with agencies involved in helping 
low income people with their bills. 

We further recognize that we have staffing issues and water theft to address. The City is 
able to complete about 120 water shut-offs per week. At that rate we can not keep up 
with delinquent account shut-offs. The city also reconginzes that water theft through 
meter by-pass or unauthorized turn-on must be resolved. 

Ultimately, the City must find a way to hold down future increases in the cost of water, to 
bring them more in line with the Genesee County water customers. To this end the City 
has recommended to Treasury, that the City leave the Detroit Water System and join 
KWA with Genesee County, Lapeer and Sanilac Counties and the City of Lapeer. We 
believe this is the most significant long term factor in stabilizing costs to the water 
customers in the City of Flint.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still needed 
By Dominic Adams | da.da.ms5 @m liv e. com 

on March 25, 2013 at 10:45 PM, updated March 26, 2013 at 1 :28 AM 

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the 

Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25, may have set in 
motion the end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, 
pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million 
gallons per day would come from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s 
getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the 
resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the 
decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start 
drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing water from our 
reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a 
county water and waste advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final 
approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency 
financial manager. All expenditures over $50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 
million annually for water service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it 


l 



pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years by getting water from 
the KWA. 

“It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the 
capacity level approved by city council because there will be increased treatment cost for the 
river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to 
be additional work done at Flint’s water plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, 
however, the plant only operates four times per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote. 

“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint 
River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties 
and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw 
water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials said they intend to purchase water, but an 
agreement has been finalized.

Andy - here is the information you requested. Let me know if you need more information. As 
we move into DWSD 2.0 without federal court supervision, I can hear the chanting “free at

2.0 if they want to work it out or get told to do it. Jim

Andy Dillon, State Treasurer 
Michigan Department of Treasury 
Lansing, Michigan 48922 

Dear Treasurer Dillon, 

We understand that you are tasked with evaluating the merit for the City of Flint to cede from 
participation In the DWSD water system. For the following reasons, we represent to you that 
Flint’s continuance in the present system is not only what is best for the City of Flint and 
Genesee County, but forthe entire DWSD customer base. 



Water is provided by DWSD to the City of Flint via a 72" water main that runs west from a 
booster pumping station at Imlay City. Water purchased by Flint is then sold to its customers in 
the City of Flint and to Genesee County. The City of Flint and Genesee County are evaluating 
the construction of a new raw water supply system as members of the KaregoncH Water 
Authority (KWA), The decision point is whether the City of Flint is best served by KWA or 
DWSD. Genesee County is not bound by Flint's decision. For this discussion, however, the 
emphasis is on Flint which encompasses its customer Genesee County. 

Thel|tbms: presented: below are based on a brief staff anafysis oF water quality; system capacity; 
capita I, an d financia i consider a Lions of the Joss of Flint as a DWSD customer. 



if the 72" " wMeT mainiiS remaining customersonthat 
line.. 

V? The 72" main to feed Lapeer, Mayfield and imlay City will need to be modified based on 
their comparatively iow consumption at 12% of the flow. That pipeline will be too large 
to support the reduced demand which presents water quality issues. 

S System users along the water transmission line in Lapeer,. Mayfield, and Imlay City may 
experience water quality problems due to reduced disinfection levels associated with 
stagnant water. Solutions include abandoning the 72" main and replacing it with a 
smaller diameter pipe or adding facilities to re-chlorinate and disinfect the water a 
second time. The latter option is problematic because re-chlorination results in higher 
levels of disinfection byproducts. 

S The Lake Huron Plant ("Plant") will require modifications to address water quality issues 
for Lapeer, Mayfield, and Imlay City. That cost is unknown. 

S The imlay Booster Station ("Station") will also need modification to feed Lapeer, 
Mayfieid, and Imlay City. An estimated cost is $1 million. 

4 




S The true water quality impact would need to be confirmed through a study or the 
master planning effort. These concerns and alternatives are based on a brief analysis, 



W If DWSD is not supplying Flint with water, then there wiflbe three high capacity pumps 
at the Station which will be significantly underutilized. 

s DWSD currently has treatment capacity of 1.7 86D, which is easily expandable to close 
to 2.0 8GD with infrastructure already in place at the Plant. Meanwhile current max day 
use of the DWSD System is only about 1 8GD. 

v'' Although more than one DWSD facility is able to provide water to Flint, the reduction in 
use asteprpsenied at tbenearestwatertreatm would result in excess capacity 

of up to 70% at the Plant. 

'$■' Thewaterline servicing Flint Is approximately 25 miles long (extending from Imlay City 
to Flint). That line would have no use if Flint joins KWA. 


Impairment j 


saver Funded Assets 


^ T^wehty^flye miles of water line would likely be abandoned, 

■S Three pump s at the Station would also be idled. 

The net book value of the water ting is at least $5M. 

I n addition, I mprovempnts were completed at the Station in 2 0 1 2 w h ich se r ves Flint and 
other customers. Th^eon^ $44 miihon. 

/ DWSD has in good faith preserved the terms and conditions of the 1965 service 
agreement with Flint which expired in 2000. Beginning in the 2000s DWSD and its 
wholesale water customers collaborated on a new model contract. Since that time, 
DWSD water cu storn ersha ve e nt e re d into new model contracts. 

The model contract provides for DWSD to recoup the costs of customer specific 
constructed facilities in the event that the contract is terminated. 


F tnarigiaf implications to Other DWSD Ratepayers 


The estimated immediate impact of the loss of Flint is m increase in rates to address a net 
revenue shortfall of approximately $22 million, or $ percent of total DWSD water reverne. 
The long-term impact would require further analysis to evaluate the capital investment and 
increases in cost to address the operational concerns noted earlier. The immediate impact 
estimate is based on the FY 2013-14 DWSD financial plan as explained below. 

S Flint volume (Including Genesee County) represents approximately 7.4% of the 
suburban wholesale water sales, and 5,9% of the total water sates (including Detroit 
retail accounts} based on approximately 1.2 million Mcf of water sales. 

S The allocated revenue requirement totals $24.23 million, which is approximately 8.3% 
of the suburban wholesale revenue requirement, and 6.6% of the total revenue 
requirement (including Detroit retail). 


2 


^ At most, variable cost savings of not providing service to Flint is 7 to 10 percent, or 
roughly $2 million. 

■ J the City of Flint's and Genesee County's revenue split ts approximately equal. Loss of 
Genesee customers to KWA while maintaining the City of Flint as a customer would 
reduce the rate and dollar amounts above by half. 

S DWSD ratepayers will incur the cost of operational changes at the Plant and the Station 
to address the water quality issues noted above, although charges to Flint during the 
KWA construction period would be evaluated. 

/ These amounts exclude the new capital investment for transmission piping for 
customers in the areas served by the Station and potentially at the Plant. Additional 
costs would be incurred to resize the water main to assure compliance with water 
quality standards. 



The ability to manage the financial risk for the City of Flint is especially precarious given its 
financial condition. As recently as yesterday, the frailty of the City's fiscal capacity is described 
by the present emergency financial manager in the Bioomberg News. The bottom line is that 
KWA's optimistic project with a cost of $272M ($82M attributable to flint KWA's proposal) 
poses an undue financial risk to the public given that a system with reliable, excess capacity is 
readily available through DWSD. That risk is even greater based on the Tucker, Young, Jackson,; 
Tull report that the KWA costs are underestimated by $100 million. 

DWSD is undergoing monumental efforts to confront long-term operationai and capital costs. 
The recent water rate adjustment was the lowest in decades, staff at all levels is actively 
involved m an organizational optimization process facilitated by EMA, there is an increased 
emphasis in long-term financial planning, and the transparency of these efforts is evident 
through more than a dozen customer-centric committees. Proactively addressing our 
borrowing costs and financial outlook is paramount to our mission. We understand the 
challenges that confront a public utility. 

The bottom line is that Flint's financial flexibility will be impaired for generations by abandoning 
the DWSD system to participate in KWA. Duplicating the available capacity will expose them to 
a very large fixed cost obligation. As water utilities continue to experience reduced demand, 
the fixed costs component for capital, operating, and debt decrease the cost sharing base. For 
this reason, DWSD provides its customers the ability to adjust demand to control their costs. 



DWSD is committed to the viability of Flint's water needs. Going forward there may be ways 
that DWSD can provide technical assistance and collaboration to the City of Flint. This includes 
methodologies to address its high water loss ratio, shut-off program, and capita! planning 
needs. DWSD has fostered a strong customer community through its outreach program. We 
encourage Flint to become engaged with these resources. Finally, DWSD has demonstrated ah 
earnest interest by offering service options specifically tailored for Flint's needs through a 
flexible contract approach. We look forward to reaching a long-term, viable solution to provide 
Flint a safe, reliable, cost-effective water system.

Finally, some comments from DEQ staff after the 4/ 15 offer from DWSD: 

Comment 1: 

From a capacity standpoint, supplying KWA is completely feasible under either proposal with no adverse impact to the rest of 
die DWSD supply network. The proposal lists KWAs contracted max day demand at 40.6 mgd, the design and rated capacity 
of die Lake Huron Plant is 400 mgd. The DWSD service area average and max day are about 650 and 950 mgd; the odier four 
water plants combined have a rated capacity of over 1100 mgd. 

I don’t know die details of die cost analysis odier than what has been reported by DWSD. It is my understanding that over the 
30 year pay back period diat full service water provided from DWSD would be more a lot more expensive than what KWA 
has projected if diey separate. Several intermediate proposals of varying cost estimates have been presented widiout success. 
KWA was issued a permit last fall for constructing an intake (independent of DWSDs) and I think the plan is to start 
construction as early as diis fall. Then a treatment plant would be constructed to treat the water. Hint has a water plant that 
draws raw water from die Flint River, but die plan would be to purchase raw water from die KWA intake and treat at dieir 
plant, using die River as a backup source. KWA has estimated a project cost of $274 million, DWSD estimated die project 
cost at $375 million; but I don’t know exacdy what die scope of work was for those estimates so I’m not sure that it’s an 
apples to apples comparison. 

Overall, besides die know impacts to DWSD for loss of revenue and increased cost to die rest of die system users to cover 
fixed cost, debt, etc., there could be odier systems revisiting dieir proposals to separate. Grosse lie and a few surrounding 
communities had looked into forming a water audiority and building a plant to serve diem; Grosse Pointe Park had submitted 
incomplete plans a few years back to build dieir own microfiltration plant. At one point, Grosse Pointe Shores was 


1 



considering a study to see if they could re-work die Grosse Pointe Farms network to purchase water from them rather than 
DWSD through GP Woods. 

Comment 2: 

A response at this point may be moot as Flint and Genesee Co. already held a press conference yesterday rejecting die DWSD 
offer. 

It is also unclear whedier DWSD provided its offer direcdy to Flint and Genesee Co. by die deadline in Treasurer Dillon’s 
letter. However, Flint and Genesee Co. still took the offer under consideration. 

Our office concurs with both Hint and Genesee Co. that die offers provided by DWSD were incomplete. 

Of the two scenarios provided by DWSD it appeared diat only Scenario 2 was listed as potentially being more cost 
effective. However, this scenario did not address die following: 

1. The DWSD scenarios are based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, die KWA project is providing 60 MGD 
of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD in the future. Therefore, in order for a more direct 
comparison the DWSD scenario would need to increase capacity to 60 MGD, which would increase fixed rate 
commodity costs as well as the capital costs for die Huron Plant diat DWSD was planning to allocate to Hint and 
Genesee Co., presumably by as much as 50%. 

2. DWSD proposals cover a 30 year period to 2042, but fail to recognize diat after diis period bond payments for die 
KWA project will be complete and result in a significant reduction in costs for die KWA option. 

3. While DWSD indicates diat Hint and Genesee Co. would be given “broadened representation”, it remains unclear 
exacdy what this means in terms of actual control in die decision making process. 

4. This scenario continues to rely on a single transmission system and would require die City of Flint to maintain its 
WTP for emergency purposes and these costs do not appear to be included. In addition, use of die Hint WTP as an 
emergency backup would leave Genesee Co. widiout an adequate backup supply to meet their 30 year needs. 

Again, without DWSD providing the specific details of diese proposals, it is difficult to provide a true comparative analysis, 
and as such Flint and Genesee Co. appear to be justified in dieir rejection of diese proposals.

SUMMARY REPORT 


TO: Brom Stibitz, Senior Policy Advisor; Department of Treasury 

FROM: Eric Cline. Unit Operations Specialist 

SUBJECT: Flint Water System Summary 

DATE: April 18,2013 


Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc. 
(TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & Sewer 
Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The purpose of this 
study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint’s Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) 
in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the City of 
Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were presented: These 
options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron 
Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or provision of variable amounts of 
water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report by TYJT 
in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA’s principal engineering firm regarding the others’ conclusions 
and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the OFR provided a comprehensive report to the State Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) 
The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the projections provided by Flint/KWA were 
acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; and 3) Identification of the options Flint will 
utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR 
recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA presented the best future option for future potable water. The 
OFR also concluded that KWA appeared to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee 
County appeared willing to assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA 
project could signify the beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and 
the KWA project had both political and popular support.

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and Flint 
officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of the KWA 
project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron intakes. This bid 
opening represented the fir st meaningful step toward commencing construction of the KWA system. The bid 
was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain them 
as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, pending review of 
any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD’s final offer provided two options. The first option was for a “supply only” rate schedule. Only water 
treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and operating 
revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA’s usage relative to the entire demand upon DWSD’s 
Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own transmission lines. 

The second option was a “full service” rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be calculated 
based upon KWA’s usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD’s final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of Environmental 
Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum annual 
rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 60 
MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given “broadened representation,” it is unclear 
exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to maintain its 
WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an adequate backup 
supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD’s offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total cost of 
this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not clear, so 
analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. As 
such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

Flint, Michigan 

Gentlemen: 

Over the last several months, governed by a process laid out by the State of Michigan, the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has proposed a number of alternatives 
for long term water supply to the City of Flint. Each alternative was offered in the spirit 
of working in earnest to address the needs, priorities and concerns of the City of Flint and 
each provided an immediate cost reduction when compared to the current costs of water 
purchased from DWSD. In the final analysis conducted by Flint, these proposals did not 
overcome the desire for the Flint/Genesee region to be served by the same system and to 
have a voice in the future decisions governing the provision of water to this region. 

Many of the proposals DWSD has made to Flint during this period are applicable to 
Flint/Genesee County or KWA with adjustments to demand and use requirements and 
would provide similar overall benefit. These options remain available for further 
discussion should the parties’ desire. These prior proposals are included in summary 
form in Attachment 1 as an expanded table 6-1 from the February 2013 State of Michigan 
Contract No. 271N3200089, City of Flint Water Supply Assessment, submitted by 
Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. For comparison purposes only, DWSD’s new 
proposal (Flint’s 30% allocated share) is inserted. 

The proposal scenarios outlined today offer a public/public partnership with options 
tailored to Flint/Genesee County or KWAs interests. For ease of writing, the remainder of 
this memo will present this proposal to KWA. Two basic scenarios are presented for 
consideration, both of which contemplate that KWA would enter a multi-year contract. 
Service commitments and usage definitions would be negotiated in the same manner as 
employed that have resulted in new contracts for other customers. 

In brief, the proposal provides a unique opportunity to reserve capacity at DWSD’s Lake 
Huron Water Treatment Plant and to participate in decision making for facility operation 
and capital investment through a joint operating committee. The proposal envisions that 
KWA would enter into a 30-year contract to purchase treated water directly onsite at 
DWSD’s Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant. 


1 




In Scenario 1 the purchased water can either be pressurized or unpressurized. This first 
scenario results in a “supply only” rate schedule, with a “standby delivery” component to 
provide for emergency service at the existing Baxter / Potter connection. This scenario 
provides KWA the ability to construct new transmission owned and operated by KWA. 

Scenario 2 maintains the public/public partnership concept and extends it to transmission 
facilities through which the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant provides water. This 
scenario results in a “full service” rate schedule. The standby delivery component is 
eliminated, since the rate structure to KWA includes costs associated with the 
transmission system between the Lake Huron Water Plant and the Baxter / Potter 
connection. 

DWSD proposes a modified rate schedule for the customers currently served through the 
contract with the City of Flint, which includes Flint and Genesee County. This modified 
schedule is intended to facilitate negotiations for a new water service agreement with the 
Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The scenarios presented herein represent the 
innovative thinking that DWSD and its new leadership are bringing to the table. Our goal 
is to provide the lowest cost water solution for the KWA service area. 

The potential rate structures are introduced in summary form herein, with preliminary 
calculations using the proposed rate structures with FY 2013-14 as a baseline. These 
calculations and the accompanying discussion are based on the assumptions regarding 
contract terms that approximate recent discussions amongst the parties. 

The proposal introduces the concepts, but does not definitively present all of the specifics, 
appreciating that such specifics are best addressed through negotiations designed to 
produce a new contractual agreement satisfactory to all parties. 


[Remainder of page intentionally left blank] 



Scenario 1 - Lake Huron Direct Supply Purchase: 

• KWA enters into a long term partnering arrangement with DWSD to purchase all of its 
primary water supply directly at the DWSD Lake Huron water treatment plant. 

• Supply rate schedule is designed to recover only water treatment revenue requirements. 
This rate schedule does not contain any delivery costs (pumping, transmission, storage, 
etc.). 

• Supply rate schedule is computed based on specific costs associated with the Lake Huron 
Plant. No other DWSD revenue requirements, including those associated with other 
DWSD water plants, are included in the rate to KWA. 

• Revenue requirements are separated into capital recovery and operation and maintenance 
expense elements. Baseline revenue requirement data (including operating budget, rate of 
return, depreciation assumptions, etc.) are identical to those developed for all other 
wholesale customers. 

• KWA is allocated Lake Huron Plant capital revenue requirements based on the 
proportion of their contracted max day demand (assumed in these calculations at 40.6 
mgd) relative to the total capacity at the Lake Huron Plant (400 mgd). The resulting 
revenue requirements are recovered through a fixed monthly charge. 

• KWA is allocated Lake Huron Plant operating revenue requirements based on the 
proportion of their contracted average daily usage (assumed in these calculations at 24 
mgd) relative to the total average daily usage at the Lake Huron Plant (assumed at 125 
mgd in these calculations). 

• Calculations are conducted for two alternatives. Purchase of pressurized water (after 
high lift pumping) and mpressurized water (KWA takes directly from clearwell.) 

• Contract includes an arrangement for emergency service at the existing Baxter / Potter 
connection, and computes a standby charge related to such service. 

• The standby charge is computed in the manner set for the by the American Water Works 
Association (AWWA) in its Manual of Water Supply Practices Ml - “Principles of Water 
Rates, Fees, and Charges” Manual Ml. 

o KWA is allocated one day’s worth of transmission related capital revenue 
requirements. 


Scenario 2 - “Full Service” Lake Huron System 

• Same as the “pressurized” option in Scenario 1, except that concept is extended to the 
pumping, storage, and transmission facilities directly served by the Lake Huron Plant 

• Transmission rate schedule is computed based on specific costs associated with these 
facilities. No other DWSD revenue requirements, including those associated with other 
DWSD transmission mains, etc, are included in the rate to KWA. 

• Revenue requirements are separated into capital recovery and operation and maintenance 
expense elements. Baseline revenue requirement data (including operating budget, rate of 
return, depreciation assumptions, etc.) are identical to those developed for all other 
wholesale customers. 

• KWA is allocated Lake Huron “transmission system” capital revenue requirements based 
on the proportion of their contracted max day demand (assumed in these calculations at 
40.6 mgd) relative to the total capacity at the Lake Huron Plant (400 mgd). The resulting 
revenue requirements are recovered through a fixed monthly charge. 


3 



• KWA is allocated Lake Huron “transmission system” operating revenue requirements 
based on the proportion of their contracted average daily usage (assumed in these 
calculations at 24 mgd) relative to the total average daily usage at the Lake Huron Plant 
(assumed at 125 mgd in these calculations). 

• Standby charge is eliminated. 

The resulting potential proposed rate structures under both Scenarios are summarized 
below.

The direct comparison over the period 2013-2042 is demonstrated in Attachment 2. 

As KWA considers this proposal, I offer the following observations for consideration: 

• The Public Partnership requires the least near term capital investment and 
preserves the economy of scale associated with operation of a large regional 
system resulting in an immediate reduction in the cost of water supply for 
Flint/Genesee, making the identified and necessary near term investment in local 
water infrastructure more feasible. 

• The Public Partnership provides the opportunity to optimize service level and 
efficiency through collaborative asset management decision making. 

• The Public Partnership provides representation for critical decision making 
consistent with DWSD newly demonstrated interest in engaging our customers in 
critical decisions impacting them. This formalizes that interest in contractual 
terms. 

• The Public Partnership reduces the risks identified with a ‘go alone’ solution, 
including further declines in use/sales (see graph), project cost overruns or 
schedule delays and other unforeseen costs inherent in starting a new venture. 
See Attachment 3 

• The DWSD Board of Commissioners has previously approved sale of raw water 
from the Lake Huron facilities for raw water end use. We remain open to further 
discussion about the raw water capacity needs and stand ready to provide an 
affordable commodity option.

DWS.D is an organization in transformation. In April of 2011, a new Board of 
Commissioners was seated with additional autonomy and more direct customer representation. 
In the past year we have demonstrated the ability to reduce costs, resolve long standing 
compliance issues and have gained support for establishing a new legal and operational 
model for DWSD that could enable broadened representation for Flint/Genesee on the 
Governing Board. 

1 remain available to discuss this proposal to assure that: each of the issues critical to 
Flint/Gencsec are addressed.

1 . DWSD’s offer is a framework subject to negotiations and is not a firm offer. 

2. DWSD’s offer is based on 40.6 mgd, the KWA plan is based on 60 mgd. 
Flint/Genesee last summer hit the peak of 40.6 mgd and this DWSD offer 
provides no room for growth. Growth would result in penalties or added cost. 

3. DWSD’s offer does not include a guaranteed rate for years two through thirty, nor 
does it provide a maximum annual increase. 

4. DWSD’s offer does not provide a redundant supply for GCDC. 

5. DWSD’s offer does not allow for the use of Flint’s existing water plant. 

6. The offer indicates that the total cost to Flint over the life of the contract would be 
$587,990,665. No indication of what annual rate of increase was used in this 
projection. Flint can only assume it is 4.4% based on the Tucker Young report. It 
is also based on 40.6 mgds. KWA’s proposal is for $649,775,166 based on 
60mgds (33% more). Based on 60 mgds DWSD’s proposal would be 
$868,950,738. 

On a final note, Flint/Genesee has great concern over the accuracy of the figures 
provided by DWSD. Attachment 1 indicates that our joint annual cost to DWSD is $50 
million; actual cost is less than $25 million. Attachment 2 indicates $800 million in 
savings over the next 30 years. That is greater than the total cost we would pay DWSD. 

Therefore, I will sign the resolution to join KWA at the close of business today. 

Sincerely, 

Edward J. Kurtz

ANALYSIS REPORT 

TO: Edward Koryzno, Administrator; Office of Fiscal Responsibility 

FROM: Eric Cline. Unit Operations Specialist 

SUBJECT: Updated Flint Water System Status Assessment 

DATE: February 21, 2013 


Analysis Summary 

On November 26, 2012, the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson 
& Tull, Inc. (TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit 
Water & Sewer Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee 
County. The overarching purpose of this study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer 
and to Flint’s Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure potable drinking water for the City 
for the foreseeable future. The Office of Fiscal Responsibility (OFR) has been the lead office representing 
Treasury in this project. 

On January 14, 2013, the State Treasurer requested responses to three questions: 1) Show the different, 
projected construction costs provided by TYJT and by the City of Flint/KWA. If these costs are different, 
explain why Treasury believes that the projects provided by Flint/KWA are acceptable; 2) identify the 
construction contingencies included in the TYJT and Flint/KWA projections; and 3) identify the options 
Flint will utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay in construction by KWA. 

This has been a very difficult project to analyze because of the number of proposals to consider, 
differences of opinion about the conclusions of various engineering analyses that have been conducted, 
the fact that the analyses are comparing an existing, operational water system with one that has not yet 
been designed, and conditions within the City of Flint that make it difficult to assess their true water 
needs. 

However, despite these difficulties, I believe that KWA presents the best future option to provide potable 
water for the City of Flint in the future. Long-term, KWA appears to be the cheaper option; the quality of 
water will almost certainly improve; Genesee County appears willing to assist the City in securing the 
financial resources for their portion of the project; this project could signify the beginning of better 
collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; the KWA project has both political and 
popular support. 

The following details how this recommendation was arrived at:

Background : 

On December 21, 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and 
the City of Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, TYJT outlined 5 
options that they had analyzed. These options were: 1) 100% water provision by the City of Flint Water 
Plant from its water source of the Flint River; 2) 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron Water by 
KWA (which would require treatment by the Flint Water Plant); 3) Effective 100% provision of treated 
drinking water by DWSD; 4) Provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD through the existing 
Potter & Baxter master meter (this option called for Flint to treat and blend river water into DWSD water 
in order to reach their daily needs); and 5) Provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD through 
the 72” Imlay City main (this option also called for Flint to treat and blend river water into DWSD water 
in order to reach their daily needs). Each of the blending options looked at Flint purchasing 4, 8, or 12 
Million Gallons per Day (MGD) from DWSD and blending the balance in river water to achieve their 
maximum daily water needs of 18 MGD. The Imlay City option also provided for DWSD to sell the 72” 
main to the City of Flint, which would then become the operational and maintenance responsibility of 
Flint. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report on December 21 to the submission of the final report to 
the State by TYJT on January 29, 2013, a number of developments occurred that made analysis and 
arriving at a final decision very difficult. They were: 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• TYJT and Rowe Professional Services Company (Rowe), the principal engineering firm for KWA 
(and Genesee County and the City of Flint), began disputing the others’ conclusions and estimates 
regarding the construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM also disputed several of TYJT’s conclusions. At a January 10, 2013, meeting with 
Treasury, the EFM also eliminated the 100% Water Plant option, using the Flint River as a 100% 
water source (which was cheapest option, as determined by TYJT). 

• At a January 10, 2013 meeting, Flint officials eliminated all of the DWSD Imlay City options (which 
were the cheapest DWSD options) over concerns of owning and maintaining the 72” water main. 
They also eliminated consideration of any of the blending options originally proposed to DWSD, in 
part over concerns of added costs to soften the water. This effectively left the only options remaining 
under consideration by Flint to be the 100% DWSD option (which TYJT estimated to be more 
expensive than either of the KWA cost options) or joining KWA. 


I believe that TYJT’s analysis was hampered by the very short timeframe in which they attempted to 
conduct this analysis; which, may have led to be being more conservative in some of their estimates. I 
believe that some of the comparable systems used in their analysis may not have been the best options but 
given that KWA is still in the design phase, may represent the best selection of comparable. I also believe, 
for whatever reasons, that all of the information (from both DWSD and KWA) TYJT needed to 
effectively analyze these options was not provided to them. 

Projected Construction Costs : 

Based upon the provided construction estimates, TYJT estimates the KWA construction costs at $357.6- 
million. KWA estimates construction costs at $272.4-million. TYJT states in their final report that they 
received “limited information” from KWA, which might have resulted in more conservative estimates. 

The primary differences between the two estimates center around 1) the cost of constructing the pumping 
stations; 2) land acquisition costs; 3) contingency costs (discussed below); 4) the provision of 



Page 3 


construction management services; 5) design costs; and 6) redundant power at the pumping stations. Cost 
estimates were reasonably similar' by both firms in other areas except for those noted above. 

The cost of constructing the pumping stations is the biggest difference between the two estimates ($24.6- 
million vs. $54.5- million). TYJT stated that they believe KWA had not designed the pumping stations to 
the point where more accurate numbers could be achieved. TYJT also stated that their estimates were 
based on construction costs for a similar- project in SE Michigan. KWA maintains that construction costs 
in Genesee County are much lower than in SE Michigan and that they have extensive experience in 
construction projects that will help keep costs in-line. KWA has also stated that the construction of the 
transmission pipeline will be done by multiple contractors in order to save time and allow more Michigan 
contractors to bid on the project. 

TYJT added $1.2-milUon to their estimates for land and easement acquisition. KWA has stated that they 
have already secured nearly all of the land and easement accesses needed for this project. It is likely that 
TYJT was unaware of this when they developed their estimates. 

TYJT also added 5% ($14.4-million) to their estimated base cost for construction management services. 
TYJT has stated that KWA has not taken these costs into account. KWA maintains that they have 
accounted for them and these costs will not be that high. 

Nearly $18-miUion was added to TYJT’s estimates for design costs and legal work for the design of both 
the pumping stations and the transmission pipeline. KWA maintains that they have accounted for these 
expenses. 

TYJT also included $1.3-million in new costs for standby power at the pumping stations. KWA has made 
no provisions for redundant power at the pumping facilities. TYJT included the provision of redundant 
power in their estimates and notes that this is an industry standard. KWA officials have stated that the 
new water plant will have redundant power but that the pumping stations will not. The stated reasons for 
not including redundant power were cost containment, that Flint can use the Flint River as a backup water 
supply in the event of an extended power outage and that the KWA systems’ water storage capacity will 
allow for 7 days of reserve supply. KWA has also stated that they will look at installing standby power 
later but can utilize portable generators at the pumping stations, if necessary. 

If the additional costs are not included, then the TYJT and the KWA estimates are within 5% of each 
other. This may/may not be acceptable differences, but I believe the only way to verify the accuracy of 
either estimate would be to utilize a third engineering firm to independently review both TYJT and 
KWA’s estimates. 

Project Contingency : 

Construction contingency costs, also known as Engineering, Land, Administration, and Contingency costs 
(ELAC) are summarized in an attached chart developed by Rowe for the City of Flint. KW A/Rowe 
estimates total construction at $272.4-million, with $53.2-million (25%) for ELAC contingencies. County 
Water and Sewer Administrator John O’Brien clarified at a January 28, 2013 meeting that there is a 15% 
contingency for unforeseen issues and 10% “extra.” TYJT estimates total construction at $357. 6-million, 
with $107.3-million (30%) for ELAC contingencies. 

TYJT stated that they believe that 25% ELAC for a project of this scope that is (at the time of the final 
report) less than 15% designed is insufficient; hence the more conservative estimate. The 5% difference in 
ELAC costs adds nearly $40-million to the TYJT estimate. 



Page 4 


Construction Cost Overrun/Construction Delay Options : 

The OFR is not aware of any contingency plans developed by either KWA or the City of Flint to address 
construction cost overruns or significant construction delays. The final TYJT Water Supply Assessment 
Report does reference an October 31, 2012 letter from KWA to EFM Kurtz in which KWA anticipates a 
“worse-case scenario” of a 15% cost overrun and a one-year operational delay. KWA projects, under this 
scenario, that water from DWSD would be cheaper than KWA until 2020 as opposed to 2016; reducing 
projected cumulative savings from $19-million to $3.9-million by Year 8 (2020). 

County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright stated at a January 28 meeting that, if necessary, KWA has the 
authority to borrow more funds to complete the project in the event that delays or cost overruns 
necessitate the borrowing of more funds. However, Mr. O’Brien also stated that the January 28 meeting 
that KWA expects to purchase insurance policies to insure against delays to the project. It has been 
suggested that a one-year delay in completion could increase project costs by as much as $20-million. 
Further discussion with Mr. O’Brien reveals that KWA is looking into purchasing a “wrap-around” policy 
against construction delays and a builders’ risk policy; the costs of which are still being determined by 
KWA. Drain Commission Wright also indicated at the January 28 meeting that if construction bids come- 
in significantly higher than estimated that KWA will likely reassess its approach to this project. 

Conclusions : 

It is likely that TYJT’s estimates are overly conservative. Their own analysis concludes that KWA’s 
projections are cheaper than their estimate of the KWA project. Even with a 15% cost overrun and a one- 
year delay (Worst-case scenario), KWA’s estimate is still lower than TYJT. All estimates for KWA are 
cheaper than the 100% DWSD option (all other DWSD options were eliminated from consideration by 
the EFM). 

That is not to say that the KWA estimates are without fault. KWA is a new venture and the “unknowns” 
exist at the initial phases of the project. KWA has the potential to be the cheaper, long-term cost for the 
City of Flint after the bond debt for construction is retired. Significant construction delays and/or cost 
overruns could greatly add to the cost of this project, which could add to the financial burden on Flint. 

Realistically, the true cost for this project will likely be in the middle of the two estimates. The bids for 
construction of the KWA lake water intake will be opened on February 26, 2013, with the expectation of 
presenting a recommendation for bid award on March 20. Comparison of the bids and the estimates for 
intake construction could be an indicator of the more valid estimate. 

There are also some additional factors that are outside of the three questions asked by the State Treasurer 
that influence a final recommendation on this project. The first is DWSD. DWSD is a “known” entity and 
the system is already in-place and in operation. DWSD may also be the cheaper option in the short term. 
However, selecting DWSD requires a 30-year commitment and the unknown aspect of future rate 
increases is very concerning to Flint officials. EFM Kurtz has stated that the City has experienced rate 
volatility over the history of its relationship with DWSD. According to the EFM, the average historical 
annual rate increase for the City is 6.7%, but over the past 10-years the average annual rate increase has 
been 10.5%. 

All estimates show KWA being cheaper to Flint than DWSD after capital costs are retired. There also 
appears to be considerable local resistance to continuing a relationship with DWSD. 

The upfront costs and the premium water charges assessed by DWSD while KWA is being constructed 
are of great concern to City officials. Flint officials have indicated that approximately $3.5-million in 
capital upgrades is needed for the Water Plant if the KWA option is selected. However, at a January 28, 



Page 5 


2013 meeting, County Drain Commissioner Wright indicated that Genesee County will permit Flint to 
participate in its revenue bond sale for KWA for Flint’s 30% share of capacity in the KWA System and 
for plant upgrades. Given Flint’s current financial situation, were this participation to occur, it will be a 
positive development for the City because it is likely Flint would have a very difficult time issuing bonds 
on the strength of its own credit rating. The Drain Commissioner also indicated a willingness to discuss 
how KWA might mitigate the $5- to $6-million cost of the “premium” rate that would be charged to the 
City of Flint by DWSD for the City to purchase water while KWA was being constructed. 

On February 4, 2013, a proposal was received from EFM Kurtz that outlined a two-phased approach to 
resolve the cost of this premium charge. First, the City will transfer six miles of 72” water main owned by 
the City that extends into Genesee County in lieu of the $2.3-million up-front payment the City would 
have to make for construction of the KWA system. The second phase involves KWA entering into 
negotiations with DWSD to purchase their 72” water main that runs from Imlay City to Genesee County 
and agreeing to purchase water from DWSD for redundant purposes in-exchange for DWSD eliminating 
the 15 % premium rate to Flint during the three-year KWA construction period. 

Recommendation : 

A recommendation is being made to support the City of Flint joining KWA. Given, the conservatism of 
TYJT’s estimates and the fact that all KWA estimates are cheaper than the 100% DWSD option, KWA 
appears to be the logical choice. EFM Kurtz has stated that he believes the KWA option is the cheaper 
alternative over time. There appears to be public support for the KWA project and EFM Kurtz has also 
stated that he believes that the Flint Mayor and City Council will support the KWA Project. 

Also, the potential inclusion of Flint in the issuance of revenue bonds by Genesee County and the 
potential for KWA to assist the City in mitigating some of the DWSD premium charges could greatly 
reduce Flint’s financial concerns. 

There also appears to be good cooperation between City and County officials in discussing this project 
and this level of engagement and dialogue between city and county officials because of this project could 
continue to grow and lead to additional areas of cooperation and collaboration. 

If further analysis on this issue is needed, please let me know.

STATE OF MICHIGAN CONTRACT NO. 271N3200089 


CITY OF FLINT WATER SUPPLY ASSESSMENT 

At the request of the Treasurer, Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. (TYJT) makes the following recommendation to the 
Department of Treasury concerning Flint's water supply alternatives. Based on the financial analysis performed of the 
various options presented by DWSD to continue treated water service to Flint compared to Flint being supplied by the 
new KWA untreated water system, TYJT believes that several of the options presented by DWSD are lower in cost 
currently and over the long run than the one offered by KWA. TYJT also believes that DWSD's most recent offer 
(subsequent to the submittal of our report) to build a smaller parallel water main from Imlay to Flint, funded by the 
entire DWSD base of customers, is the best solution offering the least cost alternative and the required redundancy by 
MDEQ. 

Furthermore, since a majority of the KWA system has not been designed and none of the system has been constructed, 
there is an additional risk that the cost of the KWA system may actually be higher than estimated due to potential 
construction delays and unforeseen conditions. This risk to Flint could be substantial since the city is responsible for 30 
percent of the KWA design and construction costs while still having to purchase water from DWSD during the 
construction period. 

Finally, there are other issues that were identified in our report that may result in risks to Flint if it were to join KWA that 
should be considered by the Treasury in determining how Flint's potable water should be supplied. These issues are 
related to redundancy and reliability, other items affecting cost, and Flint's desire to control its own destiny related to its 
water supply. These are described further below. 

• DWSD's supply to Flint is via a 72-inch water main from Imlay City. This main also supplies Imlay City, Mayfield and 
the Greater Lapeer County Utilities Authority (GLCUA). The volume of water contained within the 72-inch main is 
approximately 30 million gallons. If Genesee and Flint move to KWA then the three remaining communities' 
consumption would most likely not be large enough to maintain fresh water in DWSD's pipeline (due to loss of 
chlorine residual). DWSD may consider shutting down the 72-inch line completely due to the water quality 
concerns, which would then create an additional burden for Imlay, Mayfield and GLCUA to finance treated water 
supplies. 

• The KWA supply option is counter to the Treasury's Competitive Grant Assistance Program (Formerly EVIP Grant). 
This program has been put in place to allow for communities to consolidate their services and save money. Two 
existing customers of DWSD (Flint and Genesee County) along with the potential of others customers (GLCUA, 
Mayfield, Imlay City) separating from another water system is in contradiction to the program. 

• There is a concern over the ability of smaller systems (KWA) over larger systems (DWSD) to pay for future unfunded 
mandates and regulations. Obviously, identifying regulation requirements over 30 years is hard to determine. 
However, it is widely accepted that a large system has greater ability to respond to unfunded mandates because the 
cost can be distributed over a large customer base. 

• Although Flint will be responsible for 30 percent of the construction cost, they will only have a minority vote on the 
KWA board. Furthermore, there are other communities (Lapeer County, the City of Lapeer, and Sanilac County) that 
sit on the board and vote. However, they are not purchasing water nor contributing to the construction costs. Their 
position on the KWA Board will not provide them an ability to "control their own destiny," as they have stated to the 
Treasury.

Flint, Michigan 

Gentlemen: 

Over the last several months, governed by a process laid out by the State of Michigan, the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has proposed a number of alternatives 
for long term water supply to the City of Flint. Each alternative was offered in the spirit 
of working in earnest to address the needs, priorities and concerns of the City of Flint and 
each provided an immediate cost reduction when compared to the current costs of water 
purchased from DWSD. In the final analysis conducted by Flint, these proposals did not 
overcome the desire for the Flint/Genesee region to be served by the same system and to 
have a voice in the future decisions governing the provision of water to this region. 

Many of the proposals DWSD has made to Flint during this period are applicable to 
Flint/Genesee County or KWA with adjustments to demand and use requirements and 
would provide similar overall benefit. These options remain available for further 
discussion should the parties’ desire. These prior proposals are included in summary 
form in Attachment 1 as an expanded table 6-1 from the February 2013 State of Michigan 
Contract No. 271N3200089, City of Flint Water Supply Assessment, submitted by 
Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. For comparison purposes only, DWSD’s new 
proposal (Flint’s 30% allocated share) is inserted. 

The proposal scenarios outlined today offer a public/public partnership with options 
tailored to Flint/Genesee County or KWAs interests. For ease of writing, the remainder of 
this memo will present this proposal to KWA. Two basic scenarios are presented for 
consideration, both of which contemplate that KWA would enter a multi-year contract. 
Service commitments and usage definitions would be negotiated in the same manner as 
employed that have resulted in new contracts for other customers. 

In brief, the proposal provides a unique opportunity to reserve capacity at DWSD’s Lake 
Huron Water Treatment Plant and to participate in decision making for facility operation 
and capital investment through a joint operating committee. The proposal envisions that 
KWA would enter into a 30-year contract to purchase treated water directly onsite at 
DWSD’s Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant. 


1 




In Scenario 1 the purchased water can either be pressurized or unpressurized. This first 
scenario results in a “supply only” rate schedule, with a “standby delivery” component to 
provide for emergency service at the existing Baxter / Potter connection. This scenario 
provides KWA the ability to construct new transmission owned and operated by KWA. 

Scenario 2 maintains the public/public partnership concept and extends it to transmission 
facilities through which the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant provides water. This 
scenario results in a “full service” rate schedule. The standby delivery component is 
eliminated, since the rate structure to KWA includes costs associated with the 
transmission system between the Lake Huron Water Plant and the Baxter / Potter 
connection. 

DWSD proposes a modified rate schedule for the customers currently served through the 
contract with the City of Flint, which includes Flint and Genesee County. This modified 
schedule is intended to facilitate negotiations for a new water service agreement with the 
Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The scenarios presented herein represent the 
innovative thinking that DWSD and its new leadership are bringing to the table. Our goal 
is to provide the lowest cost water solution for the KWA service area. 

The potential rate structures are introduced in summary form herein, with preliminary 
calculations using the proposed rate structures with FY 2013-14 as a baseline. These 
calculations and the accompanying discussion are based on the assumptions regarding 
contract terms that approximate recent discussions amongst the parties. 

The proposal introduces the concepts, but does not definitively present all of the specifics, 
appreciating that such specifics are best addressed through negotiations designed to 
produce a new contractual agreement satisfactory to all parties. 


[Remainder of page intentionally left blank] 



Scenario 1 - Lake Huron Direct Supply Purchase: 

• KWA enters into a long term partnering arrangement with DWSD to purchase all of its 
primary water supply directly at the DWSD Lake Huron water treatment plant. 

• Supply rate schedule is designed to recover only water treatment revenue requirements. 
This rate schedule does not contain any delivery costs (pumping, transmission, storage, 
etc.). 

• Supply rate schedule is computed based on specific costs associated with the Lake Huron 
Plant. No other DWSD revenue requirements, including those associated with other 
DWSD water plants, are included in the rate to KWA. 

• Revenue requirements are separated into capital recovery and operation and maintenance 
expense elements. Baseline revenue requirement data (including operating budget, rate of 
return, depreciation assumptions, etc.) are identical to those developed for all other 
wholesale customers. 

• KWA is allocated Lake Huron Plant capital revenue requirements based on the 
proportion of their contracted max day demand (assumed in these calculations at 40.6 
mgd) relative to the total capacity at the Lake Huron Plant (400 mgd). The resulting 
revenue requirements are recovered through a fixed monthly charge. 

• KWA is allocated Lake Huron Plant operating revenue requirements based on the 
proportion of their contracted average daily usage (assumed in these calculations at 24 
mgd) relative to the total average daily usage at the Lake Huron Plant (assumed at 125 
mgd in these calculations). 

• Calculations are conducted for two alternatives. Purchase of pressurized water (after 
high lift pumping) and mpressurized water (KWA takes directly from clearwell.) 

• Contract includes an arrangement for emergency service at the existing Baxter / Potter 
connection, and computes a standby charge related to such service. 

• The standby charge is computed in the manner set for the by the American Water Works 
Association (AWWA) in its Manual of Water Supply Practices Ml - “Principles of Water 
Rates, Fees, and Charges” Manual Ml. 

o KWA is allocated one day’s worth of transmission related capital revenue 
requirements. 


Scenario 2 - “Full Service” Lake Huron System 

• Same as the “pressurized” option in Scenario 1, except that concept is extended to the 
pumping, storage, and transmission facilities directly served by the Lake Huron Plant 

• Transmission rate schedule is computed based on specific costs associated with these 
facilities. No other DWSD revenue requirements, including those associated with other 
DWSD transmission mains, etc, are included in the rate to KWA. 

• Revenue requirements are separated into capital recovery and operation and maintenance 
expense elements. Baseline revenue requirement data (including operating budget, rate of 
return, depreciation assumptions, etc.) are identical to those developed for all other 
wholesale customers. 

• KWA is allocated Lake Huron “transmission system” capital revenue requirements based 
on the proportion of their contracted max day demand (assumed in these calculations at 
40.6 mgd) relative to the total capacity at the Lake Huron Plant (400 mgd). The resulting 
revenue requirements are recovered through a fixed monthly charge. 


3 



• KWA is allocated Lake Huron “transmission system” operating revenue requirements 
based on the proportion of their contracted average daily usage (assumed in these 
calculations at 24 mgd) relative to the total average daily usage at the Lake Huron Plant 
(assumed at 125 mgd in these calculations). 

• Standby charge is eliminated. 

The resulting potential proposed rate structures under both Scenarios are summarized 
below.

The direct comparison over the period 2013-2042 is demonstrated in Attachment 2. 

As KWA considers this proposal, I offer the following observations for consideration: 

• The Public Partnership requires the least near term capital investment and 
preserves the economy of scale associated with operation of a large regional 
system resulting in an immediate reduction in the cost of water supply for 
Flint/Genesee, making the identified and necessary near term investment in local 
water infrastructure more feasible. 

• The Public Partnership provides the opportunity to optimize service level and 
efficiency through collaborative asset management decision making. 

• The Public Partnership provides representation for critical decision making 
consistent with DWSD newly demonstrated interest in engaging our customers in 
critical decisions impacting them. This formalizes that interest in contractual 
terms. 

• The Public Partnership reduces the risks identified with a ‘go alone’ solution, 
including further declines in use/sales (see graph), project cost overruns or 
schedule delays and other unforeseen costs inherent in starting a new venture. 
See Attachment 3 

• The DWSD Board of Commissioners has previously approved sale of raw water 
from the Lake Huron facilities for raw water end use. We remain open to further 
discussion about the raw water capacity needs and stand ready to provide an 
affordable commodity option.

DWS.D is an organization in transformation. In April of 2011, a new Board of 
Commissioners was seated with additional autonomy and more direct customer representation. 
In the past year we have demonstrated the ability to reduce costs, resolve long standing 
compliance issues and have gained support for establishing a new legal and operational 
model for DWSD that could enable broadened representation for Flint/Genesee on the 
Governing Board. 

1 remain available to discuss this proposal to assure that: each of the issues critical to 
Flint/Gencsec are addressed.

Update 


As:fcB@w Emer|pn^ 3 look forward, to working with pd (Werfoe PexlMveral. 

months as we Goptmae prpgi^ss tow asustamabfe and financially secure city gvooemnient. As 
I stated # ffe time of my appointment, my focus over tbe sext sevexal months is to kansifop the 
. city feorh . Dfersigfet by ■ an lamergency Manager to home rul e under the guidance of a Receivership 
'transition Atloisory Uoard. This will be done by cxmtimdng to achieve the expectations set forth 
ip the Seven Point Ifatisidbii Man. Assuming those exudations are met, I cnramfoy expeet: such 
transition: to occur sometime during the month of April, 201 5. 

The pi 'ogress: which has been, made is detailed in the aitaohed status report. While progress has 
been made, there are numerous steps yet to be taken.. Many will involve the City Council, 
including:: 

« Final adoption of the Capital improvements Plan 

* Final adoption Of ordinances regarding planning, budgeting, fund balance, deficit 
elimination, purchasing, and others which are necessary to establish the 
organizational structure upon transition 

® Completion of training requirements for Council members

I will be working with the City Council, Mayor Walling, City staff and the new City Administrator 
Natasha Henderson to assure that we can achieve these, and other necessary steps. 

There are other issues which we will all continue to address. One primary issue, of course, is the 
issue of water quality. We all know it is a very serious concern, and our staff is working every 
day to improve water quality. The plan articulated by former Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, 
which does not include reconnecting to DWSD, remains in place at this time. This week, as 
promised, the City released an REP to secure the services of a firm with experience in improving 
water quality where the source of water is a river. We also posted on the City’s web site answers 
to some questions which have been raised in the community. We will continue to add information 
as it becomes available. We are also planning on an informational meeting next week to continue 
addressing citizen concerns. 

Another issue is the low level of resources available to address public safety issues in the City. As 
you know, we commissioned an independent study of our police and fire organization in order to 
assess our capacity and to determine how to best organize our police and fire departments in light 
of their diminished resources. The results of that study are being presented next week at the 
Council’s Public Safety meeting, and will provide guidance as we consider the upcoming FY16 
and FY17 plans and budgets. 

Finally the issues surrounding water and public safety emphasize the tenuous financial situation 
of the City - one which, while significantly improved, will remain tight. The five year financial 
projections done last year, and the adopted budgets for FY15 and FY16, showed financial stability 
for FY15 and FY26, but projected a very significant gat between revenues and expenses for FY17. 
Regardless of whether or not the City remains under the control of an Emergency Manager, 
balancing the FY17 budget in a financially responsible manner will be a challenging task. If 
decisions become necessary to further reduce the workforce and service levels, they will be very 
difficult, as there are no easy answers. Likewise, responding to demands for high levels of service 
and lower costs in the form of water rates or taxes will also be difficult. 

Achieving our objectives will take time and effort for all involved. In the next week, the Finance 
Committee will be meeting on Wednesday to review the second quarter Progress Report on the 
Strategic Plan, and the same evening will be a City-sponsored forum on water issues. Next 
Thursday, the Public Safety Committee will meet to review the results of the ICMA Police and 
Fire study. The following Monday, January 26, will be the regular Council meeting, where the 
FY14 audit will be presented and where the Council will consider adoption of the Capital 
Improvement Plan, as well as second reading and final adoption of the strategic planning and 
budgetary ordinances.

Looking further forward, the Council will be engaged in updating the Strategic Plan, beginning 
with a workshop on Wednesday, January 28 th . It is anticipated that a special Finance Committee 
meeting will be necessary for February 4th, in order that Council can consider adoption of the 
framework of the updated Strategic Plan on Monday, February 9 th . 

Over the next several weeks I will be working with City staff to develop a tentative calendar of 
events which will guide the budget preparation process and other items which I feel need to be 
completed prior to transition. 

This is an aggressive agenda for all of us. I believe it is critical to have in place the many pieces 
necessary to both prepare for a successful transition, and more importantly, so that the City of Flint 
continues on a path of sustainability and financial stability. 




Flint, Michigan - Jamsary is, 2015 ~~ The City of Flint will be hosting a water presentation on 
Wednesday, January 21, 2015 at 7pm. That presentation will he held in: the City Hal! 
Dome and will feature information detailing water treatment, water distribution and the 
steps being taken to ensure that citizens get water that meets all regulator/ safety and 
quality standards. “We want the residents, businesses and visitors of Flint to know that 
the water In Flint is safe and that we are working everyday to make improvements to our 
system to ensure that/’ said City DRW Director Howard Croft. “'Our goal is make sure we 
get people the Information on our efforts and assure them that wo are on the right track 
with them.” 


DRW Director Croft and Utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson will be joined on a 
panel by representatives from the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and LAN engineering. Written questions 
from the audience will be collected during the presentation and answered by the panel 
after the presentation.

Recent .events: have raised concerns among many as to the safety and quality of the water 
provided by the City's utility system. The City is and continues to be committed to assuring that 
residents and visitors know that the water is safe and that those responsible for providing 
water are working every day to improve the quality of the water. The quality of the water does 
need improvement, but that is not to be confused with safety qf the water. The recent notice 
by IViDEQ, clearly stated that the wafer provided by the utility system is safe to drink, but 
cautioned that some vulnerable groups may want to consult with their health care provider if 
they have concerns. The City remains committed to their efforts to assure that the water Is safe 
for everyone and that quality is both Improved and improving. 


To date, the City lias taken the following actions: 

« As an i ntegral part of the transition to the Flint River on a temporary basis, the MDEQ was 
consulted about the City’s plans, and ultimately issued necessary permits to proceed. The 
City also engaged the services of the LAN engineering firm to guide the city in installing 
the necessary equipment to treat the water on an ongoing basis. This resulted in the 
development of a comprehensi ve drinking watef plan. 

; :®:. The City' monitors its water quality on a daily basis to assure that water quality remains 
within established guidelines. With the variances in water temperature and the leakage and 
infiltration problems arising as the result of failure of parts of the distribution system, water 
quality did exceed, for a time, some of the established guidelines. -This resulted in, the 
issuance of die recent notices k> the public. Upon receipt of information that some 
guidelines were exceeded, the City's priority focus was to bring water quality back within 
guidelines hitorts taken to address non-compliance included increasing water flow 
through valve replacements and hydrant flushing and optimizing treatment processes. 

* The City has committed to increasing conmumieation with the public in order to inform 
water users factually of the issues which have arisen, to alleviate unnecessary concern and 
to identify the steps being taken to address the issues. This is being implemented through 
detailed and easy to understand educational materials being made available both online and 
at City Hall, as well as through ongoing public informational meetings. 

» Most recently, in light of recent concerns raised by resident groups over the quality and 
safety of water. Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft and his staff collected 
questions from citizens during a recent public meeting. After reviewing these questions, 
BPW Director answer them in concise detail; the result of that 

work is a full Water §ysteni Qnestions: and Answers document is available online. Along 
with the detailed information within, the document also contains links to other source 
documents and regulatory statutes found online which were used as reference. <s We want 
the residents, businesses and visitors of Flint to Mow that the wafer in Flint is safe 



and that we are working every day to make improvements to ear system to ensure 
that” said Croft. “Dim goalls make sure we get people the information on oar efforts 
oral assure them that we are on ike right track with them.” More documentation, 
including pMgftidr' water quality monitoring: reports, wiilhe.made avaiifeble. 

♦ Additionally, a number of public meetings have and will continue to take place. Two of 
the most recent of these took place at the Antioch Baptist Church and the Mott Community 
College Regional Technology Center, These meetings were held by concerned 
neighborhood groups and were attended by Mayor Walling and DPW Director Croft. At 
'both meetings, citizens voiced their concerns and asked questions about water quality and 
the recent violation notice. Director Croft offered detailed answers to common questions, 
but also offered to investigate specific water issues raised by residents in which the City 
could offer assistance. Those in attendance came away with a better understanding of the 
issues surrounding the drinking water in their community. 

• The City of Flint will be hosting a water presentation on Wednesday, January 21, 2015 
at 7pm. That presentation will be held in the City Hall Dome mid will feature 
information detailing water treatment water distribution and the steps being taken to ensure 

; that citizens get water that meets all regulatory safety and quality standards. City DPW 
■ Director Howard Croft and Daugherty Johnson, Utilities Administrator, will be joined on 
a panel, by representatives from theOenesee County Drain Commissioner’s office, the 
Michigan Department oHinvironmentaj Quality and LAN engineering: -Written questions 
from the audience will be collected during the presentation and answered by the panel after 
the presentation. 

* The City of Flint has also determined that in light of the serious concerns raised, it will 
secure the sen ices or an external firm with expertise in managing drinking water quality 
to assess the steps that the city has taken, to make recommendations as to other steps to be 
taken, to oversee their implementation, and to monitor operations until the City’s water 
source becomes the KWA. A Request for Proposal was issued on January 15. 2015, with 
proposals due back on January 26. 

The DWSD Question: 

As a result of the concerns raised, several community members have suggested that the City 
reconnect to the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD). DWSD has advised that they would 
he willing to allow such a reconnection without a hook-up lee. However, the City would be obligated 
to pay a fixed: monthly charge of $846,700 plus the.S14.92/Mcf cost of water itself and agree to a 
long term airangbihent. The City’s analysis of the I3WSD proposal concludes that the City’s cost 
would increase by more than $12 .million per year at the proposed rates, and eould increase even 
more as proposed rates are subject to change after July i, 2015. Tins increase in costs would not be 
in the best interests of the City or its water users, as the City ig Gommiited to assuring safety and 
improving water quality by following its current: plan, and reconnecting to DWSD would likely 
require deferment of existing capital improvements or an additional increase in rates.

RE: Water Ouesilons 

DATE: Janasr^lS, 2015 


The decision to switch to the; Karegnondi Wafer Authority as the City 's permanent wale 
•^purep w as made following e>:tensi.ye:mseamh and in-depth engineering; studies:. After 
entering thfeh contract with KVVA arii ttfe existing water 

service; contract by the Detroit Wafer andfCaWhrsge Department fees&ma. diligence 
was -vitille:- for the community 

SuppottedKWA Water to arrive. The City eon eluded, .from this work that the Flint River 
presented- a : safe and financially responsible alternative water source. The decision to: 
psethe Flint IRiver. as,. anlihterhfedisfe Water source whs approved by stats regfeafery 
officials In 2014 whereby the City was permitted by-the.'JMre|il^fi Department of 
Environmental Duality to proceed with treatment of water from the Flint River. 


The following gpestfens cifiz8ps,.afid the City's 

responses follow. This document will be put on the City's website for public viewing 
within the next several days. 


1, What was the process by which the decision was made to switch from Detroit 
water to Flint River water? Who was responsible for what decisions'? 

On March 2.5* 2013, after evaluating cost emnapapsons for a permanent water 
source, the support from the Mayor, voted 1 7 - i approving: a 

resolution to Karegnondi Water Authority (K'WA). Oil March 

29*,. resolution 2013E.M041 was signed, authorizing the City of Flint to enter into a 
contract with the KVVA. 

On April IS* 201 3, then Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz, signed fed cOatePt^PlfeMiyely 
purchasing 18 MOD of capacity from the f<WA. 



On April i 7™ t 2013: Ctetrdt Water sent a letter 

terminating tee etestihf water service contract between, the City- of Flint and. Detroit. 

With: tee te^^ take effect 1.2 months later on April 1 7 A 2014, a gap was. 

created between the end of the OWSD contract and the start of the KWA, 

On June 28A 2013, following City Would fill 

the interim gap, a formal, ail clay meeting was held at the Flint Water Plant: with all 
interested parties including City of Flint Officials (COF), representatives from the 
Genesee GoontyDmin Commissioners Office (GCDC), tile Michigan: Department of 
Environnienfot Quality (DEQ), and the design engineers from Ihe, previous plant 
upgrade Lockwood, Andrews, and N&wnam (LAN). 

The purpose and agenda of the meeting was to determine the feasibility of the following 
items: 


1 . Using the flint River as a Water Source 

2. The ability to perform the necessary u pgrad.es to the Treatment Rapt 

3. The ability to perform quality, control 

4. The ability for Flint to provide wafer to Genesee County 

5. The ability to meet an Aprii/May 2014 timeline 

6 . Development of a cost analysis 

Th e con ver satio n was:gukted with focus on the engineering:,, regulatory, and qua lit 
aspects of each item listed. The resulting determinations were made. 


1. Yes. the Flint River would be more difficult to treat but is viable as a source. 

2. Yes. it was possible to engineer and construct the upgrades, needed for the 
treatment process, 

3. Yes, w;f.h support from. LAM engineering wh!eh : works. with: several water systems. 
SfOued the stale, quality control could beaddressed. 

4. No, the Flint treatment plant would not : have the capacity needed to treat and 
distribute sufoclehtwater:^ fd meet: the documented needs: of Hint and : Genesee 
County. 

5. Possible, it was determined that many obstacles needed to be overcome hut 
completion by the Aprii/May 201 4 target was reachable. 

8. Next stepe ffom the meeting were for LAN fo present the City with a proposal 
that would include engineering, procufempht,. and cpnstrhctip.n needs for the 
project aion g. with cost estimates. 

As a result of extensive evaluation., discussions with tire professional engineers, and 

consulting the state regulators, the D%>a:ftth^nt : of FubiibiWbrhS^alPhg with the Finance 


waiting for the KVV'A to come online. The plan to accomplish this was accompanied with 
a construction timeline, a needs analysis, for resources, and an Ft 1 4 spending plan 
to. complete the project. 



2. Was it known prior to the switch that there would be problems managing total 
coliform and fecal coliform bacteria levels in the water? 

It was understood that the Flint River would be subject to temperature variations, rain 
events, and have higher organic carbon than Lake Huron water and would be more 
difficult to treat. These facts were balanced against a licensed staff, LAN engineering’s 
extensive experience in this field, advanced equipment that Flint has for treatment, and 
support from the DEQ. 


3. What were the projected costs and benefits of the switch, and what have been 
the actual costs and benefits? 

The engineered costs for upgrading the Flint Plant to treat KWA water from Lake Huron 
were projected to be -$9,000,000. These upgrades need to be in place prior to KWA 
water reaching Flint and are coupled with an additional -$3,500,000 in annual 
operational expenses for workforce additions, electricity costs, and process equipment 
for a total of ~$1 2,500,000. 

The final year that the City of Flint purchased water from DWSD, the cost was 
$12,400,000 and that cost was projected to rise to -$14,400,000 in 2014 and increase 
to -$16,000,000 in 2015. 


The financial benefit for switching to the river was the opportunity to divert that revenue 
towards capitalizing the upgrade expenditures needed to run the plant and the 
development of a capital improvement program for the aged infrastructure without a 
significant increase to the water bill. This aspect was figured into the cost analysis at 
the time of the recommendation. 


Based on the current DWSD rate structure, it appears that the actual costs to purchase 
water this year would have been higher than projected, The fixed cost would have been 
-$5,100,000 and the additional commodity or water costs would have resulted in 
another ~$1 1 ,000,000 given the City's current water usage. This would result in an 
estimated ^$16,000,000 in this year alone. 


The upgrade expenditures stayed close to the engineered projections. The 
improvements at the water plant cost -$7,000,000, the remediation and development of 
Bray Rd for lime disposal cost -$1,700,000 and the increased operational costs so far 
this year are below the estimates and on target to finish the year at -$3,000,000. These 
changes come to a total of ~$1 1 ,700,000 of necessary expenditures in the first year. 


In addition to the ability to capitalize the upgrades, switching to the Flint River has 
allowed us to develop a Capital Improvement Plan for the Utility Department that will 
begin replacing pipe underground this spring and will account for overdue maintenance 
concerns such as valve replacements, and pipe lining extending the useful life of the 
system and allowing us to deliver better quality water.

4. What were the causes of Increased levels of in h aiomethaaes ? Have those 
causes bean sufftoiontiy addressed? If not, witat needs to fee dene to proves

liters of water over the MCI., daily for 70 years. 


The is to present the DEQ with: an Operattfeeaf 

Evaluation Report that assesses what caused the violation and what the proposed 
remedy is. The City generated a report to the DEQ in November 2014, which assesses 
each area of the Flint, water system including, water source, treatment process, and 
distribution system, 'The evaluation was, eomgl©f© ; with short and, long: Term

What we discovered is that as miles.: of the City’s 

disfributbh mains if will, at times, reside In the system for up to 3 or 4 weeks. Water 
purchased from DWSD is drawn from Lake Huron, chlorinated, and then travels over 80 
miles to reach the City. By the time the water reaches Flint it IS stable and capable of 
Withstanding this type of residency time within the system. Water drawn from the Flint 
River, specstseally in summer months when the temperature is fluctuating, is more 
susceplibfe to being such as high residency times end increased 

chemical reaction. 

The DEQ requires that a minimum of 1 00 tests be performed monthly for chlorine 
residuals at various locations throughout the, system. When residua! levels are too low, 

It creates an environment In which bacteria such as fecal coiiform can grow. After 


switching sources, we June, 2014 that wore consist

Flint Water Improvement Rian 

Dear Governor Snyder: 

On behalf of the Flint community, i am writing to convey serious concerns about water quality and to 
request your support for my proposed FlintWaterimprovement Plan. Access to sate and ciesn water is 
a baste human right, and, therefore, policy and budget decisions need to ensure that water is affordable 
and secure for everyone in Flint: and all across Michigan ft is essential there Is City, State 3nd Federal 
cooperation to address the challenges here and to meet the needs of vulnerable populations. 

Thefliht Water Improvement Wan fs : focused in fve areas: safety, quality, access, invest mentand : 
education. The plan puts safety and quality first because this is fundamental. It is designed to be a 
sustainable solution for the City of flint and the community as we move towards a new permanent 
water suppiy from take Huron through the haregnondi Water 1 Authority. My plan offers new ideas and 
also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs at the State and Federal 
levels. 

Safety & Quality 

* i£X)% Safety is the standard 

* City of Flint reports testing data to the public re assure safety and expands testing sites and 
frequency 

* Ssing on experiertced river water treatment operational management irrthe: Cityof Flint

* Develop a revised affordable payment plan policy to encourage customers to return 

* Design Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance 
Fund for the elderly and ; vulnerable families 

Investment

and community organizations to provide Information and water assistance with the Keep the 
Water Flowing Fund and support services 

® Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with consenratfarr and efficiency' (piloted in 
summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

If is also critical to restore the public confidence in Flint Water, The smpiementat Ion of this pi an m ust be 
accompanied by: extensive community engagement including local elected officials. My objective is to 
work with you and your appointed officials. State Senator Ananich, State Representatives Phelps and 
Neeley, Congressman Ktidee, communitygrou ps, businesses, churches, found3t!ons, the Flint City 
Council, and ail of the City of Flint and government personnel. 

it is imperative that we communicate better and provide residents more information. I understand 
representatives from the M ichigan Depa rtment of Environme ntai Quality will be joining a public fo rum 
this week at City Hall. This engagement going forward is vital so thank you for supporting their efforts. I 
think thts issue of transparency is important for comrmjnfties alt across the State, i recommend a review 
of the appiicabie laws and policies and, at a minimum, a new requirement that water testing data he 
reported publicly no less than quarterly by law in all Michigan communities in FliMks population 
category. 

Thank you for the consideration Governor. Thereis nothing more important ih Flint rightnow than fixing 
the water problems. We must work together to identify funds to repair and update the water treatment 
facilities and city-wide i nfrastructure and to help those persons without access to dean waterso that 
the entire Flint community has sustainable, safe, secure and affordable water now and into the future. 
This is an important Issue for the state of our State of Michigan and purge you to work with us to 
implement solutions.

Much progress has been made in preparing for the transition, including action by the City Council 
to complete the following: 

• Final adoption of the Capital Improvements Plan 

• Final adoption of ordinances regarding planning, budgeting, funds balance, and deficit 
elimination 

• Update of the Strategic Plan’s Vison, Mission, and Goals 

• Adoption of budget priorities to guide development of the F Y 1 6/F Y 1 7 budget 

Additionally, our new City Administrator Natasha Henderson is on board and is assuming duties 
as the experienced and professionally trained chief administrative officer for the City. 

There are several issues which we are continuing to address, including: 

• Water safety, quality, and affordability continues to be a top priority. The City’s water 
supply today is safe, as measured by the same MDEQ standards that have been in place for 
years, and steps are being taken to improve treatment and distribution processes in order to 
address issues of discoloration and odor, and to assure continued safety. Reviews of our 
pricing structure are also underway to assure that customers are treated equitably while 
generating sufficient revenue to operate the system. 

Public safety continues to be an area of critical concern. The independent study of our 
police and fire organization provided a number of recommendations focused on how to 
best deploy the resources we have, and also confirmed that the staffing levels afforded by 
our limited resources are extremely low in comparison to comparable municipalities. 

This emphasizes the critical continuing importance of renewing the two voter-approved 
public safety millages and working to assure continuing state support through the 
assignment of state troopers and through financial support of the City lock-up. Loss of 
any of this support would be a disaster for the City. 

• Achieving and then maintaining financial stability will continue to require constant 
attention. Approval of the ordinances regarding financial stability and the anticipated 
approval of the $7 million loan provide additional tools with which to work. Attention will 
need to be paid to not only developing and adopting budgets for FY 1 6 and F Y1 7 but doing 
so in the context of understanding the impact of those budgetary decisions into the 
following three years. Essential to this is making the budget decisions which truly address 
achievement of die stated vison, mission and goals for the City as adopted by the City 
Council. Unfortunately, the challenges in doing so will be great, as the City will continue 
to be faced with the reality of a structural deficit, where for the foreseeable future current 
expenditure patterns exceed revenue streams - a difficult position, given the City’s already 
low level of services. Complicating this further is the potential impact of the retiree health 
care lawsuit, once the final outcome is decided.

• Finally progress continues with modernizing the operations of the City and setting the 
framework for future development. With the Master Plan and Capital Improvement Plan 
in place, focus is now turning to implementation, including updating the Zoning Ordinance. 

As we move forward with preparing for transition, there is much work yet to do. Today I am taking 
three actions consistent with our path: 

• Adoption of an updated purchasing policy - 1 am enacting the revisions to the Purchasing 
policy which were reviewed by Council within the past few months. These changes are 
made with the goal of assuring that the process of obtaining goods and services is consistent 
with the expectations of the Strategic Plan. There must be proper oversight and 
transparency, with a goal of obtaining goods and services that best meet the needs of City 
departments. The process must ensure competitive procurement, conducted in a timely and 
ethical manner. The City Council has an important role in assuring compliance with the 
policy, which is not the same as conducting purchasing operations. 

• Confirming the role of the City Administrator - Before the search for a new City 
Administrator was begun, it was determined, within the context of the Seven Point 
Transition Plan, that an experienced and professional City Administrator would be selected 
on the basis of an open competitive process, and that the duties of the City Administrator 
would be structured in a manner which assures the ability to manage and direct the 
administrative affairs of the City in a professional manner. While those duties and 
expectations were described in the job description of the City Administrator and in 
recruitment materials, I am now formally enacting them in Emergency Manager Order 
Number 3. 

• Re-establishing salaries for Mayor and Council - As we are moving towards transition, the 
duties and responsibilities of the Mayor and City Council are expanding towards the 
traditional roles of a City operating under home rule. Council meetings are now held twice 
per month, with committee meetings held once per month. The Mayor is now much more 
engaged in a Chief Executive role. Consequently, I have determined to re-establish the 
salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place immediately prior to the appointment 
of an Emergency Manager in November, 2011. Continued receipt of the re-established 
salaries, however, is contingent upon attainment of certain training. The re-established 
levels, and the contingency regarding training, is found in Emergency Manager Order 
Number 4. 

Over the next several weeks, there will be much work with respect to finalizing the loan application 
and developing the FY16 and FY17 budgets along with FY18, FY19, and FY20 projections. Work 
will also continue with implementing improvements of the water system, and reviewing our 
associated rate structure. Evaluation and implementation of the recommendations for best use of 



Flint City Council 
April 13,2015 
Page 4 


police and fire resources will continue, including corrective action for the police evidence room 
issues. Summer street maintenance and repair programs, as well as sidewalk repairs will soon be 
underway. Public meetings regarding the zoning ordinance are being held, with a recommended 
updated ordinance expected for consideration in late spring. A revision to the City’s business 
licensing ordinance is expected soon. These are but a few of the many activities to be expected as 
the City makes the best use of its resources to provide the best level of service it can within the 
resources it has. 

I look forward to working with you as we move towards transition to home rule under the guidance 
of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. Please contact me if you have any questions.

§ 18-21 PURPOSE AND SCOPE. 

THE VISION FOR THE CITY IS A 
WELL-MANAGED, FINANCIALLY 

STABLE, AND ACCOUNTABLE 
GOVERNMENT FOCUSED ON CREATING 
AND MAINTAINING A VIBRANT AND 
GROWING COMMUNITY THAT WILL 
ATTRACT AND RETAIN RESIDENTS, 
BUSINESSES, STUDENTS AND VISITORS 
AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE 
CITY’S MISSION IS TO ASSURE THAT 
RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES, STUDENTS 
AND VISITORS RECEIVE MUNICIPAL 
SERVICES IN A CUSTOMER FRIENDLY 


AND FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE 
MANNER. 

STRUCTURING CITY 

OPERATIONS TO ACHIEVE THIS 
MISSION AND VISION HAVE REQUIRED 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LONG RANGE 
STRATEGIC PLANNING AND 
BUDGETING. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS 
ESTABLISHING THE PRINCIPLES BY 
WHICH GOODS AND SERVICES WILL BE 
OBTAINED. 

THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING 
GOODS AND SERVICES MUST BE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE STRATEGIC 
PLAN. THERE MUST BE PROPER 
OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY, 
WITH A GOAL OF OBTAINING THE 
GOODS AND SERVICES THAT BEST 
MEET THE NEEDS OF CITY 
DEPARTMENTS. THE PROCESS MUST 
ENSURE COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT 
CONDUCTED IN AN ETHICAL AND 
TIMELY MANNER IN ORDER FOR THE 
CITY TO CARRY OUT ITS DUTIES. USE 
OF CITY RESOURCES FOR PERSONAL 
USE IS GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF 
EMPLOYMENT AND POSSIBLE 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. 

PURCHASING GOODS AND 
SERVICES SUPPORTS THE BUSINESSES 
AND COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE 
BUSINESSES RESIDE. ACCORDINGLY, 
WHEN FEASIBLE, IN TERMS OF 
QUALITY, COST, AND ACCESSIBILITY, 
THE CITY SHOULD MAKE GOOD FAITH 
EFFORTS TO PROCURE GOODS AND 
SERVICES FROM BUSINESSES WITH A 
PHYSICAL LOCATION WITHIN THE 
CITY LIMITS, AND IF NOT ABLE TO DO 
SO, TO MAKE SIMILAR EFFORTS WITH 
RESPECT TO BUSINESSES PHYSICALLY 
LOCATED IN GENESEE COUNTY 
AND/OR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES.

Flint, Michigan ~ April 13, 2015 - By letter to City Councii issued today, Emergency 
Manager Jerry Ambrose congratulated City Councii for tilsi r recent actions committing to 
restoring and maintaining the City's financial solvency. Mr. Ambrose stated that recent 
actions to adopt a series of ordinances requiring commitment to establishing appropriate 
financial reserves and an: improved planning and budgeting process indicate that the 
Councii understands the need to restore and maintain Flint’s financial solvency. “While 
there is much yet to do, these are positive steps in the right direction/' said Mr. Ambrose. 
"The ongoing; challenge wilf be to adhere to the requirements the City Council has adopted 
themselves.” 

Mr. Ambrose’s letter also reiterated the priority issues currently facing the City — 
developing a long range financial plan, beginning with the upcoming FY16 and FY1? 
budget: continuing to address concerns with water safety, quality and affordability; and 
Stabilizing; resources for public safety. ‘These are clearly the top priority issues, and ones 
which require the cooperation of aft if they are to be successfully addressed /’ stated Mn 
Ambrose.; ■‘Unfortunately, resources are extremely limited, and we must make decisions 
which address the most critical issues in a financiaiiy sound manner ~ and that often 
means we cannot do everything everybody wants:' 

Some of the ingredients of restoring Flint’s financial solvency on a sustainable basis, 

according to Mr. Ambrose, inofude obtaining a $7 million loan to finance the accumulated

General Fuad deficit and approving the consolidation of the 87th and 68th District Courts, 
Both issues: are pending before City Council and Mr. Ambrose is hopeful; for a quick 
positive response. "The terms and conditions offered with this loan equate to a good deal 
for the City and will enable it to begin to more quickly rebuild its financial solvency. 
Approving the co u rt consoi idatio n will reduce City expenses by $8.4 million over the next 
1 0 years and will help to provide some stability in funding other public safety services.” 

Mr. Ambrose also presented Council with actions he is taking to continue the progress 
towards transition, including an updated purchasing ordinance and an order officially 
defining the role of the new City Administrator as the chief administrative: officer for the 
City. '‘Moving the City forward in today’s environment requires professional managers, 
clear responsibilities, and modern practices;’ said Ambrose. “These actions move In that 
direction, and hopefully move the Council forward In truly becoming the governing body 
of the City, focused on policies and accountability for moving the City forward based on 
its vision, mission, and goals.” 

Recognizing the increasing rote: of the Mayor and Council as the City transitions to home 
rule with oversight by a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Mr. Ambrose announced 
that he Is reestablishing the saiaries for Mayor and Council at the teveis in place before 
the City was most recently placed into state receivership He noted that Council meetings 
are now held twice per month, with committee meetings held once per month, and the 
Mayor is now much more engaged in a Chief Executive role. Continued receipt: of the re- 
established salaries, however, will be contingent upon attainment of certain training 
levels. These training levels were established in prior orders of the Emergency Manager, 
and Couhciinlembers will have until November 1, 2015 to obtain it. or their salary will be 
reduced to the current level

Next week sometime can Wayne & I have a follow up conversation with you re Flint water? Wayne & I had a call with 
Brad W. @ DEQ. He is getting back to us re some of the items on your list. So maybe mid-week? 

I think the bottom line is Wayne, Brad & I (we would "volunteer") to meet with your minister group here in Lansing [to 
the extent we can] provide info to some of the issues they raised with you. It may be better that you are not at the 
meeting. Of course that is your call but maybe let us 'peons' do it. Harvey could be there in your stead; since he knows 
them. I am sure whatever we convey they probably won't be happy.

Wayne- 

We need to have more discussion relating to Flint water. There seem to be even more issues regarding the water than 
there should be. I'll have a series of questions that I really need some answers to if you can have someone who 
understands the problems there. The people there just seem to be getting a raw deal from the city particularly in terms 
of the information they are getting. I know you are as worried about their health as I am so we kind of need to get 
answers to some of these concerns.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, 
state approval still needed

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council March 25, may have set in motion the end to 

Flint paying to get its water from Detroit 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for 
treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the 
Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department Of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per 
day from the Flint River. 


Tuesday's meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 
“We got there," Councilman Joshua Freeman said, "That's the important thing.” 


There were more than 50 people at Monday's meeting. 

"Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion art: the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca 
Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition eyecdti ^liililllil "If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at 
risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs." 



Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste 
advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Hint has an emergency financial manager. 
All expenditures oyer £50,000 must be approved. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water 
service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save million overelgHt^ieirs by getting water from the Kwa, 

’Tt's a historic djght in the City of less with the capacity level approved by city 

council because there will be increased treatment cost for toe 111111111111 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work 
done at Flint's water plant. 

Flint's water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only

GENESEE COUNTY, MI — The state has approved a critical permit that allows the Karegiiondi 
Water Authority to tap into Lake Huron with a 1.5-mile underground intake. 


But water authority officials are still waiting for Flint to decide if it will he part of it. 


ConslTueiion on the Intake — estimated to cost $27 million — might mark the no-tuming-back 
point for the massive project, and county Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said other developments 
make it necessary Flint to make a final decision on its involvement in the next few months. 


As control of Flint has shifted from mayors and city councils to emergency managers, the city has 
never committed to buying a minimum volume of water from the KWA. 

"The only question at this point really is whether Flint is going to be a partner," said Wright, who has 
met with emergency financial manager Ed Kurtz and wants to resolve the question before Kurtz 
leaves his position — something likely to happen soon after the November election. 

"I'd say we have a couple of months here," Wright said of Flint's deadline. He described Kurtz as 
positive about the city's potential involvement but said, "There's still some questions Flint is working 
on with Detroit and Lansing.” 


Kurtz said he can't predict what will happen. 


"We're looking at all our options," Kurtz said Friday. 

County Commissioner Ted Henry, D-Clayton Twp., said regardless of the city's participation, the 
pipeline can be built by the remaining partners: Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties and the city of 
Lapeer, 

"The answer is yes," Henry said. "It will be a little different but it can go,"

The drain commissioner said construction of the pipeline intake, which has already been designed, is 
expected to start this year, after the job is put out for bids and borrowing is authorized by the county 
Board of Commissioners, 

Building the intake will be specialized work, part of which must be done from a barge, and will require 
building tunnels below the sand bo ttom of the lake and laying an 8 4 -inch pipe below the surface of 
the water. 

In addition to the state Department of Environmental Quality permit to build the intake, the KWA 
also needs approval from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Wright said. 


A. 45-day public comment period on the intake permit has passed and county officials said they expect 
the permit to be approved within two weeks. 

Among other recent developments in the pipeline project: 

® The Genesee County Water and Waste Advisory Committee, made up of elected and appointed 
city, township and village officials, has voted unanimously to set a date for accepting public 
bids to build the intake. 

* Tire same committee has approved negotiating a contract with Wade Trim to act as program 
manager for the pipeline project once all necessary permits have been received. 

® The county has revised its estimate on the cost of the intake portion of the pipeline from $40 
million to $27 million. 


Wright said his office is ready to negotiate a contract for Wade Trim to oversee the pipeline work, and 
said he expects six or seven engineering and surveying companies to assist in getting the job done. 


County officials count those jobs among the 1,000 that they say will he created by building the 
pipeline. 

"1 want to use local (people) wherever possible and keep the money here," Wright said. 

The drain commissioner said the selection of Wade Trim is important to the city of Flint because it 
signals the start of" engineering, which includes decisions about the size of pumps, motors and pipes 
that will be used to build the pipeline. 

Flint officials have options, including the use of Flint River water, or continuing to purchase wafer 
from the city of Detroit, 


5 



Wright said the only choice for the rest of the county is build the pipeline or sign a 30-year contract 
with Detroit. 


A KWA study claims that continuing to buy water from Detroit will cost the region $2.1 billion during 
the next 25 years. By building a pipeline, that cost would be $1.9 billion over the same period, the 
KWA Web site says. 


After the initial 25-year period, the cost of water would be less than 25 percent of the projected cost of 
water form Detroit, according to KWA.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council March 25, may have set in motion the end to 

Flint paying to get its water from Detroit 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for 
treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the 
Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department Of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per 
day from the Flint River. 


Tuesday's meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 
“We got there," Councilman Joshua Freeman said, "That's the important thing.” 


There were more than 50 people at Monday's meeting. 

"Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion art: the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca 
Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition eyecdti ^liililllil "If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at 


risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs." 



Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste 
advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 


Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Hint has an emergency financial mana|ll 
All expenditures oyer £50,000 must be approved. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water 
service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $1,9 million overelgHt^ieirs by getting water from the Kwa, 

’Tt's a historic njght in the City of less with the capacity level approved by city 

council because there wifi be increased treatment cost for toe 111111111111 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work 
done at Flint's water plant. 

Flint's water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only 
operates four times per year. 

Councilman Bryant Holden was the lone dissenting vote* 

"It was a protest vote," Holden said. "I knew they had enough votes. I just fee Mike the Flint River is our best option."

Here is the letter from the Genesee Co Drain Commission, My interpretation of the contents would be their estimate 
$13, 2mm (vs the $12.mm discussed this morning). 

They included their contract with the City, Sec 5.7 references prevailing rates the City would be charged; that is 
different than the rates reflected in the $13. 2mm. So that contract may need to be modified. 

They also raise some other items (under Procedure to Activate Supply - p.3) that may have cost implications.

SUBJECT; Letter Dated September 30, 201 5 
Wolfson to Henderson 


My staff and I have reviewed the letter referenced above and have prepared tins quick 
memorandum to explain the economics concerns and ramifications of the temporary cessation of 
the Flint water treatment operations and the return to DWSD/GLWA supply. 

This memorandum is broken down into three parts; economies, procedure and concerns. 


I, Flint held a water contract with DWSD. Flint also had the franchise rights to 
DWSD water for Genesee County. Therefore, Genesee County received DWSD water via the 
Flint. The water rate was calculated on that joint demand. In 2013-2014, the allocated cost was 
$25,303,062 or $738,066 per month plus $13,01 per mcf. 

In 2013, DWSD terminated the Flint contract effective April 2014, The Flint chose to go to the 
Flint River as its source water until K.WA water was made available. With the contract 
terminated, the franchise was terminated and. the county had to go to DWSD for water because 
Flint could no longer supply DWSD water and the Flint River and the Flint water treatment, plant 
does not. have the capacity to serve both utilities. 


DWSD established a new rate for GCDC that included significant non-contract and non-member 
charges to access the water. GCDC also acquired approximately 9 miles of water main pipe 
from the Flint (The Detroit water meter at the county line between Lapeer and Genesee and the 
Flint water plant is approximately 1 1 miles into the county.) The pipeline is of no use to Flint 
under the Flint River supply or KWA supply scenario. As part of the purchase agreement, 
language was included for emergency reconnection for Flint to D WSD through this water line. 



GCDC water rates with DWSD are as follows: 


My 2013 - April 201.4 (Flint Contract) 
May 2014 - June 2014 
July 2014 June 2015 
July 201 5 - Present 


Fixed Monthly 

Commodity 

$346,863 

$13.01 

$423 Mi) 

$15.18 

$1,149,400 

$3.89 

$900,000 

$11.86 


As yon can see, the fixed monthly lees and commodity fees have had significant swings. This is 
because under the Flint contract, only 40% of revenue was fixed. GCDC went to 80% and are 
now 60®4 for the current billing period. 


Upon reviewing DWSD's letter of September 20.1 5, DWSD went back to the 2013-2014 rate, 
added 4% for FY 14-15 and added approximately 11,3% for FY 15-16. This would create a 
water revenue requirement for a combined Flint/Genesee supply. In Section 1 d) of the letter, 
they state they would subtract GCDC current payments from that volume, leaving the amount to 
be paid by Flint. Remember, GCDC is paying the non-contract/'non-customer penalty charges. 

The reported rate would be $662,100 monthly fixed and $8.93/mcf commodity. Based on 1 5 
million gallons a day and a 30 day month, the monthly charge would be: 

$662,100 + 15,000,000 gal x 30 days x 1 mcf / 7,480 gallons x $8,93 / mcf 

$662,100 + $537,232,62 === $1,199,332.62 per month 

Flint, over the last Mo seasons, has seen periods of water flow in the 20 to 25 mgd range due to 
water main breaks. This period has lasted 2 to 3 months. What is the additional cost if the 
monthly average was 21 mgd? 


6,000,000 x 30 / 7,480 x S8.93 / mcf- $214,893.04 per month 


The only way for DWSD to provide water to Flint is a. common meter at the county line and flow 
through a county water main. As previously stated, the Flint and GCDC have a contract 
regarding this potential circumstance (see 5.7 attached). 

Assuming the fixed rate by DWSD is correct, the cost with the current commodity would be: 

$662, 1 00 + 1 5,000,000 x 30 / 7,480 x $11.86 -SI ,375,602.67 

And. again, with water main breaks, fee additional monthly cost would be $285,401 .00, 

Paragraph 1 d) of the DWSD letter recognizes this issue in the last sentence: “Depending on. 
how water is provided to the combined GCDC/Flint customer, alternative rate structures may be 
appropriate.” 

We can back into that alternate rate based on our knowledge of the DWSD rate structure. 

DWSD wants 60% of its revenue from fixed rate. 

Vol ume per month 
49,428 mcf 
50,590 mcf 
100,018 mcf 


GCDC fixed 
Flint fixed 
TOTAL 


$900,000 

$662,100 

$1,562,100 



Total commodity required is $1,041,400 

Rate based on volume $1 0.41 would be the alternati ve rate 


The adjusted rate for Flint would then be: 

50% of fixed rate plus $10.41 per mcf 

$781,050 + $15,000,000 + 30 / 7,480 x $10.41 $1 ,407,320 

And again, at this rate, the water main break situation could add $250,508 per month 

Therefore, Flint’s expected bill for DWSD supplied water for a nine month period with 2 months 
of high flow would be $13,166,896. 


1 . Agreement with DWSD and common rate for joint GCDC/FHnt water supply would be 
required. Agreement needs to include separate billings to Flint, and GCDC, Flint to pay 
directly to DWSD based on meter readings at Baxter and Potter and Station 2 on Flint plant 
site. GCDC makes no representation to the water quality - that is between Flint and 
DWSD, The agreement needs a termination transfer protocol for Flint exiting and GCDC 
remaining. 

2. Separate agreement with Flint: back up supply was anticipated on an emergency basis. 
Nine months to a year of service requires a more detailed agreement. Water outage due to 
line break and cost to repair, etc. The agreement needs a termination clause if Flint is still 
on DWSD when GCDC is ready to turn on its water treatment plant in the fall of 2017. 

3. The 72-inch line will be required to be reactivated. This will require flushing, pressure 
testing, and BAC-T sampling. 

4. Station 2 meter needs to be calibrated and GCDC will need access to control the valves and 
read the meters. 

5. Flint needs to reacti vate the Dort Reservoir. 

6 . Flint should perform a significant water flush of the distribution system just prior to the 
switch over. 


Flint Distribution System 

The TTHM and lead issues here arising due to the water quality at the residential tap: Everyone 
agrees that the water leaving the water plant is clean, clear, and lead-free. At the residential tap, 
it has been shown to contain lead, is often brown in color, and has an odor. These are all 
indications of problems in the distribution system. The distribution system was built for a 
population of 250,000 people and major industrial use. Current population is below 1 00,000 and 
there is limited industrial use. 

If Flint does not continue to make improvements/modifications to the distribution system, the 
problem at the residential tap will continue. 



Concerns 

WHS the lead sampling protocols change based on. Flint's switch back to DWSD? 

What happens to water treatment plant personnel during this 9-month period? Will they be laid 
off or carri ed as an additional expense? 

When Flint switches to KWA, will the staff be capable of treating the water or will the learning 
curve begin again? 


It is the understanding of GCDC that all of the current samples that have been compiled at the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant have all tested within EPA and MDEQ guidelines. The emergency 
appears to be in the distribution of the water, which incl udes lead service leads to several 
residences located througho ut Flint and not in the treatment of the water. As the treated water 
leaving the Flint Water Treatment Plant is within EPA and MDEQ guidelines, GCDC is 
confused as to what the emergency is at this time or why Flint would need to purchase water 
from DWSD. The quality of the water leaving the Flint Water Treatment Plant is as safe to 
drink as the water that would be transmitted by DWSD to Flint. 

Given the facts as they have been provided to GCDC, if DWSD begins to supply Flint with water 
via GCDC, the elevated lead levels will not immediately disappear and Flint will be paying an 
additional million dollars plus a month over what it is currently paying to provide the same clean 
potable water to its residents. Additionally, by Flint receiving water from DWSD via GCDC, 
Flint will not be performing corrosion control measures on the DWSD treated water. This is 
important because once Flint begins to treat the raw water provided by KWA, the lead issue may 
resurface and continue until the corrosion control measures that will need to be restarted take 
effect, which GCDC estimates may take up to eight (8) months to establish the necessary film to 
separate the distribution system from the supply water. 

The DWSD letter purposely pits Flint against Genesee County customers by offering a lower rate 
to Flint than is currently being offered to GCDC. And the delivery point is the saute. 

These are our quick thoughts on the matter. As time progresses, we will have more time to 
understand the issues and most likely additional concerns will present themselves.

Subject: state money for detroit water 

Sara: 

I was at a City Council meeting last night when Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson said the state has only wired 
Flint $2 million of the $6 million approved by the state Legislature. 

She said the city has been told it will receive an additional $2 million in January and another $2 million in April. 


l 



Henderson said she's asked that the money be sent immediately because the city was required to pay Detroit the entire 
$12 million upfront, before the water was reconnected, and its water and sewer fund balance has dropped significantly 
as a result. 

Several council members also spoke about this, and Council President Josh Freeman called the payment plant "beyond 
ridiculous" given the city's financial position. 

Is there someone who can talk to us about this?

We (Treasury) think we can restructure the drinking water loans the City currently has. Essentially this means deferring 
the upcoming April & Oct principle payts. [ We can't forgive their loans nor extend the maturities], 

I am rounding the numbers... originally they had 4 loans totally $40+mm. The current amt outstanding is about 
$20mm. The cash benefit of deferring the principle payts is approx. $2. 1mm. 

I had talked to Jerry A. re where they would use the money. One possibility would be the consultant they are looking 
hire. The other is to pay for that pipeline replacement he talked about. 

I talked to Jim Sygo @ DEQ to see if they had any issues because they are responsible for the program side. He checked 
with his staff. They had some concerns about opening up 'Pandora's Box' i.e., other distress communities would want 
to do this. But at the end of the day I think they 

would ok the deferral particularly if you (the Gov's office) supported it. Jim had left me a v-mail so I can get back to him 
Monday to really confirm.

By Flint Mayor Dayne Walling 


Access to safe and clean water is a basic human right. And a citizen’s right to safe drinking water 
should not be based on how much money you earn, the neighborhood you live in or if your local 
government is under the control of an emergency manager. 

All citizens have a fundamental right to know that such a critical resource as their water supply is 
safe and accessible. But that is not happening in Flint at the moment. 

That is why, on January 18 th ' I forwarded a request that Governor Snyder adopt my Flint Water 
Improvement Plan. My plan, focused on the areas of safety, quality, access, investment and 
education, starts by calling for 100 percent safety as the standard for water. 

The plan calls for reporting of water testing to the public by city officials, an amnesty program to 
reduce fees for Flint water turn-ons, accelerated water system capital improvements and 
partnerships with community organizations to help with water payment assistance. Fm also 
reaching out to other state and elected officials for support. 

The request comes as residents, as evidenced in a series of recent community meetings, continue 
to have concerns about the quality of Flint’s water. Earlier in 2014, several boil-the-water 
advisories were issued by the city because of issues with bacteria found in water in some parts of 
Flint. Gov. Snyder’s appointed emergency manager recently told customers that Flint was in 
violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of the high level of trihalomethane (TTHM) — 
a byproduct of chlorination — in drinking water samples last year. 

A contradictory order from the city saying the water was safe but could present risks for infants, 
the elderly and those with compromised immune systems confused residents further and 
compounded the worries of Flint’s vulnerable populations. Marry that with costly water rates that 
have threatened individuals’ access and you have the crisis of concern and confidence swirling in 
Flint today. 

Sadly, because Flint is under Michigan’s controversial emergency manager system of 
governance, locally elected officials have been largely limited to serving as sounding boards to 
justifiably worried Flint residents. 

This is unacceptable. Not only should Governor Snyder visit Flint in the midst of this ongoing 
crisis, but his administration should make it the priority that the community expects. 

It’s time for the Snyder administration to do what is best for the citizens of Flint — immediately. 
There is nothing more important in Flint right now than fixing the water problems. 

This will take time and money so the sooner the new investments are made, the better. 



Friend, 


Access to clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human right. 

That's why I just sent Gov. Snyder my Flint Water Improvement Plan. It focuses on the areas of 
safety, quality, access, investment and education. My letter urges the governor to quickly 
implement these ideas so that Flint's water is 100% safe. 

Please contact Gov. Snyder by calling (517) 335-6397 for by clicking here) and ask him to take 
action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. 

My plan offers new ideas and also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance 
programs at the state and federal levels. Here is my plan: 

Safety & Quality 

• 100% Safety is the standard 

• City of Flint releases testing data to assure safety and expands testing to households 
with support from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 

• Support alternatives for those advised not to drink the water by their doctors through 
the Michigan Health Endowment Fund and community partners to protect the 
vulnerable like seniors and infants 

• Bring on experienced river water treatment operational management in the City of Flint 

• Require water testing data to be released quarterly by law in all Michigan communities 


Access 


• Announce an amnesty program for turn-ons and reduce the turn-on cost in Flint 

• Develop a revised payment plan policy to allow customers to come back on to the Flint 
system 

• New Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency 
Assistance Fund for customers (modeled on Federal and State energy utility programs: 
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; Michigan Energy Assistance Program; 
State Emergency Relief) 

Investment 

• Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital 
Improvement Plan through Federal and State Investments 

• State approves City of Flint's Distressed Cities Fund applications 

• Federal and State forgiveness of payment to Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund 

• Federal and State financing for future improvements 

• City Water Department implements budgeted FY15 projects including leak detection, 
valve repairs, new pipes and meter replacements 


Education 



• Develop a community partnership to provide household and business customers with 
information on testing and conservation 

• Ongoing partnership with Michigan Department of Human Services, United Way, 
Salvation Army and community organizations to provide information on water 
assistance 

• Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with conservation and efficiency 
(piloted in summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and 
Consumers Energy) 

The struggle with our water has gone on for too long. The state must take action and do its 
part. 

Please ask Gov. Snyder to take action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's 
water is safe. 


Thank you for your ongoing support. 

Sincerely, 

Dayne 

P.S. -- Please send this to friends and family so they can take action too!

Flint Hires International Urban Water Experts of 
Veolia North America to Assess City’s Water Issues 


Flint, Michigan - February 10, 2015 - The City of Flint has retained a team of urban water experts 
from Veolia North America to conduct an analysis of the city’s water system. Veolia, which is 
the world’s largest water services and technology company, will assess how Flint’s water is 
tested and distributed, including reviewing water treatment processes and operations, laboratory 


l 



testing and analysis, and engineering reports that detail the city’s treatment and distribution 
systems. 

“We understand the frustration and urgency in Flint,” said David Gadis, vice president of Veolia 
North America’s Municipal & Commercial Business. “We are honored to support your 
community with our technical expertise so that together we can ensure water quality for the 
people of the city of Flint.” 

Veolia anticipates its analysis to take less than two weeks, at which time they will present 
findings to City officials, including the Mayor, City Council and the Emergency Manager. Once 
the findings are presented, city officials will determine how to move forward. 

"Addressing the City's water challenges are the top priority right now and it is important to bring 
in an independent, highly qualified team to work with us to address the safety and quality 
issues,” said Mayor Dayne Walling. 

“Until we have completed our analysis, we cannot say for certain how long it will take to provide 
solutions to Flint’s current water situation,” said Gadis. “We have extensive experience handling 
challenging river water sources, reducing leaks and contaminants and in managing discolored 
water.” 

“Veolia worked diligently to respond to our Request For Proposal in a thorough, professional 
way and demonstrated the ability to immediately support us as we ensure safe, clean water for 
our residents,” said Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. 

The Veolia team hit the ground running Tuesday morning, meeting with water officials to 
provide an overview of the work to be conducted. “We look forward to helping Flint’s team find 
ways to address and improve the city’s drinking water operation,” Gadis said. 

The company designs and provides water, waste and energy management solutions to 
communities and industries across the country, including providing water and wastewater 
services to 530 communities in North America. More information is available at

Attached is the release with the proper date. 


For Immediate Release 


Recent Tests Show Flint Water within EPA Guidelines 


Flint, Michigan - February 27, 2015 - The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(MDEQ) Testing lab has provided results to the City of Flint showing that test results for TTHM 
levels for the month of February are well within EPA guidelines for safe water. All eight testing 
sites showed levels of TTHM ranging between 14.9 and 28.5 micrograms per liter (pg/L), well 
below the Maximum Contamination Level of 80 (see chart below). 

The testing results confirm the progress made by the City to address concerns regarding the 
safety of its water supply and corroborates findings by the City and independent tests by other 
organizations that the water today is safe. “Flint’s water supply is meeting all safety guidelines 
set forth by the EPA,” said DPW Director Howard Croft. “Today’s findings by the MDEQ 
reinforce the progress we have made, and should help rebuild confidence in the safety of Flint’s 


l 



drinking water. We still have work to do to improve water quality and are committed to being 
vigilant to assure that water safety is maintained.” 


These results also show that the four month average for test results is now within EPA guidelines 
for five of the eight testing areas in the City. However, because EPA regulations require that the 
four month average for all testing sites be within guidelines, the City of Flint will still be 
considered to be out of compliance by MDEQ. The City expects to receive notice within the next 
few weeks indicating non-compliance, and system users can expect to receive official notice of 
non-compliance in the month of March. 

Meanwhile, the City continues to work on maintaining water safety and improving water quality. 
While steps are being taken daily to improve quality, the City is expecting a formal set of 
recommendations from its water quality experts within the next few weeks. 


The detail of the study results, a report of the progress being made and preliminary 
recommendations from Veolia will be shared with the newly formed Water Advisory Committee 
and Water Technical Committee, whose first meetings are scheduled for next week.

Recent Tests Show Flint Water within EPA Guidelines 

Flint, Michigan - February 27, 2015- The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(MDEQ) Testing lab has provided results to the City of Flint showing that test results for 
TTHM levels for the month of February are well within EPA guidelines for safe water. All 
eight testing sites showed levels of TTFIM ranging between 14.9 and 28.5 micrograms 
per liter (pg/L), well below the Maximum Contamination Level of 80 (see chart below). 

The testing results confirm the progress made by the City to address concerns regarding 
the safety of its water supply and corroborates findings by the City and independent tests 
by other organizations that the water today is safe. “Flint’s water supply is meeting all 
safety guidelines set forth by the EPA,” said DPW Director Howard Croft. “Today’s 
findings by the MDEQ reinforce the progress we have made, and should help rebuild 
confidence in the safety of Flint’s drinking water. We still have work to do to improve water 
quality and are committed to being vigilant to assure that water safety is maintained.” 

These results also show that the four month average for test results is now within EPA 
guidelines for five of the eight testing areas in the City. However, because EPA 
regulations require that the four month average for all testing sites be within guidelines, 
the City of Flint will still be considered to be out of compliance by MDEQ. The City expects 
to receive notice within the next few weeks indicating non-compliance, and system users 
can expect to receive official notice of non-compliance in the month of March.

Meanwhile, the City continues to work on maintaining water safety and improving water 
quality. While steps are being taken daily to improve quality, the City is expecting a formal 
set of recommendations from its water quality experts within the next few weeks. 

The detail of the study results, a report of the progress being made and preliminary 
recommendations from Veolia will be shared with the newly formed Water Advisory 
Committee and Water Technical Committee, whose first meetings are scheduled for next 
week.

For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Moves Ahead with $5 million in Water Treatment Improvements 


Flint, Michigan - April 16, 2015 - Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose, with approval from the 
Department of Treasury, has authorized a contract with LAN, the City’s consulting engineers, to 
immediately proceed with design and installation of granulated activated carbon filter for the 
Water Treatment Plant. Installation of the filter was one of the primary recommendations from 
Veolia and others as a means to help assure that City water will continue to be within EPA 
guidelines. Installation is scheduled to begin in Mid-June, with completion by mid-July. 

Other action steps are also underway at the plant, including cleaning plate settlers, repairing the 
clarifier, and adjusting chemical dosing and levels as also recommended. Additionally, a contract 
is being finalized for the water main leak detection project, hydraulic modeling and flushing is 
underway, and bids for the replacement of 2 miles of major pipe are being reviewed. 


l 



Nearly $5 million has been budgeted to implement these actions, which in large measure are the 
ongoing types of action necessary to maintain the water treatment and distribution system. $2. 1 
million of this amount is budgeted for replacement of the pipe along Dupont St., and $1.6 million 
is budgeted for the GAC, with $900,000 budgeted for water main leak detection. Actual 
replacement of the pipe is scheduled to begin in June, and to be completed by early September. 

These steps are all part of the action plan recently released by the City as it continues its work to 
maintain the safety of the water and improve its quality. Recent testing has shown that Flint’s 
water is meeting all regulatory safety standards, with TTHM levels being significantly below the 
maximum level accepted. 

The measures that have been taken to date by the Flint Water Plant staff have resulted in a 
significant improvement in the quality of Flint water since last summer. “Both the hardness 
and TTHM levels are at the lowest point since the switch to the Flint river last April,” said DPW 
Director Howard Croft. “Installing the GAC filter, in addition to these other steps, will further 
bolster the positive direction we are moving in to continue improving the quality of water in the 
City.”

FDCVT Grant Apps_8-19-15.pdf; Flint River Water Quality 


One of my 'take-aways' from the meeting this afternoon was to follow up on whether they could 
use those Distressed Cities' $s for filters. Remember last year they did receive $2mm which they 
used for 'water related items. This year they want funds for the property assessing area. Their 
project cost is more than the grant limit. It is not dear they realize that. The deadline application is 
Oct 15 if they were, willing to change the application. Assuming that is doable. 

With Wayne away ( and before the 1:00 mtg).., a call was set up actually earlier today with Natasha 
Henderson, Do you care if we still do that ? The email setting it up is attached. Obviously we are 
not going to commit to anything. 

Let me know if you need anything else.

Tom, 

Below are the answers to your questions, if you have any further questions, let us know. Thank you. 


Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these (FDCVT) $s ? 

ANSWER: We received an application from the City of Flint on September 17 th . The amount requested for the project is 
$2M (the limit for a local unit) and it is estimated to take $3.1M to complete the entire project. They also indicated that 
if full funding is not awarded, it is doubtful that they will be able to move forward with the project. The proposed 
project is: 

"The city proposes to hire a qualified contractor to provide property assessing services. Specifically, this 
contractor will create digital property sketches of all improved properties, evaluate existing property conditions 
and improvements by providing real property data verification, and conduct a comprehensive appraisal 

valuation study. This process will take place over a period of 3 years, from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2019." 


Do we know if they have plans to? 

ANSWER: Since they asked for the entire $2M for the above project, we would assume they are not submitting any 
further projects, however we are not sure. 


l 



And have they asked {& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, and if so, what did they use those $s for? 

ANSWER: Treasury awarded Flint two grants in FY 2015 under the FDCVT program. Treasury has not yet received any 
reimbursement requests from the City. Therefore, we have not distributed any of the FDCVT grant related funds to the 
City. The two grants are:

assistance has allowed the City to replace miles of aged pipeline and begin efforts to install a 
specialized filter at the Water Treatment Plant. 

In February, Flint was awarded a total of $2 million through two Financially Distressed Cities,

Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these $s ? Do we know if they have plans 
to? And have they asked (& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, [knowing that it 
hasn't been going that long], if so, what did they use those $s for. 

Finally, if they hadn't applied yet... given the current Flint water situation; 

Could they use these grant funds to purchase filters for individual residents for use in their homes ? 

if you can get back to me quickly I would appreciate it. Thanks

$5 million in grants available for local governments 

facing financial distress 

Money for special projects to free up funds for services 

Municipalities experiencing financial struggles can apply for a $5 million grant program that can 
help fund special projects and free up tax dollars for important services. 

Applications for the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships grant program are 
now available. Municipalities interested in applying for an award must submit applications to the 
Department of Treasury by 1 1:59 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015. 

All cities, villages, and townships, experiencing at least one condition of “probable financial 
distress” as outlined in Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act*, 
are eligible to apply. 

“This program offers critical assistance to municipalities facing significant financial difficulties,” 
Gov. Rick Snyder said. “Grant dollars can help troubled cities, villages, and townships fund 
projects which, in turn, frees up valuable tax dollars for other critical services that benefit 
residents and taxpayers in those communities.” 

Grant funding may be used to pay for specific projects, services, or strategies that move the city, 
village, or township toward financial stability. Preference will be given to applicants from local 
units in which: 

• A financial emergency has been declared in the past five years; 

• An approved Deficit Elimination Plan for the General Fund is currently in place; or, 

• Two or more conditions indicating “probable financial distress” currently exist. 

For more information about FDCVT grants, including the application for cities, villages, and 
townships, visit www.michigan.gov/revenuesharing. 

*Conditions of “probable financial distress” relating solely to school districts are not included as conditions for 
FDCVT, as school districts are not eligible.

I am following up on yesterday's phone call with you, 

Angela wifi contact you to set up a conference call for tomorrow afternoon. Because Wayne is out of town Torn Saxton 
will participate in the discussion regarding your request. Tom and i 'would request you, Peter Bade and Howard Croft be 
on the call. 


We have a number of follow-up questions: What is the basis for the estimated $18M cost to temporarily reconnect to 
the Great Lakes Water Authority? What is the timeline? Why didn't Viola advise the City about the potential for 
elevated lead levels when using Flint river water? What assurances do you have indicating a temporary reconnection to 
the Water Authority resolves the elevated lead problem or other system problems? Who are the assurances from? Did 
the Viola report recommend using Ortho Phosphates to treat the water?

since the assessing cost exceeds the grant and they couldn't do the project anyway ?

Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these $s ? Do we know if they have plans 
to? And have they asked {&. rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, [knowing that it 
hasn't been going that long]. If so, what did they use those $s for. 

Finally, if they hadn't applied yet... given the current Flint water situation; 

Could they use these grant funds to purchase filters for individual residents for use in their homes ? 

if you can get back to me quickly I would appreciate it. Thanks

To be honest I am not sure... i don't have the history/background to know whether we would actually turn 
them/communities down { & we might) if they can't fully fund their project. 1 am sure that area (assessing) is in chaos 
as 'well in Flint 

If that 'were the case i.e., we would say no to the assessing project; then yes in terms of the switch to water related 
projects. I think the number ! heard yesterday was 10,000- 15.000 filters for $250k. Or maybe you create a program 
to replace the curb-to-horne lead piping.

Tom, 


Below are the answers to your questions, if you have any further questions, let us know. Thank you. 


Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these (FDCVT) $s ? 

ANSWER: We received an application from the City of Flint on September 17 th . The amount requested for the project is 
$2M (the limit for a local unit) and it is estimated to take $3.1M to complete the entire project. They also indicated that 
if full funding is not awarded, it is doubtful that they will be able to move forward with the project. The proposed 
project is: 

"The city proposes to hire a qualified contractor to provide property assessing services. Specifically, this 
contractor will create digital property sketches of all improved properties, evaluate existing property conditions 
and improvements by providing real property data verification, and conduct a comprehensive appraisal 

valuation study. This process will take place over a period of 3 years, from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2019." 


Do we know if they have plans to? 

ANSWER: Since they asked for the entire $2M for the above project, we would assume they are not submitting any 
further projects, however we are not sure. 


And have they asked {& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, and if so, what did they use those $s for? 

ANSWER: Treasury awarded Flint two grants in FY 2015 under the FDCVT program. Treasury has not yet received any 
reimbursement requests from the City, Therefore, we have not distributed any of the FDCVT grant related funds to the 
City. The two grants are: 



Project Name 

Brief Description 

$1,100,000 

Water Pollution Control Incinerator Shutdown 

Water system enhancements through 
improved waste management 


Water Main Leak Detection Survey and Condition 
Assessment 

Water system enhancements through leak

Below are the answers to your questions, if you have any further questions, let us

Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these (FDCVT) $s ? 

ANSWER: We received an application from the City of Flint on September 17 th . The 
amount requested for the project is $2M (the limit for a local unit) and it is estimated to 
take $3.1M to complete the entire project. They also indicated that if full funding is not 
awarded, it is doubtful that they will be able to move forward with the project. The 
proposed project is: 

"The city proposes to hire a qualified contractor to provide property assessing 
services. Specifically, this contractor will create digital property sketches of ail improved 
properties, evaluate existing property conditions and improvements by 

providing real property data verification, and conduct a comprehensive appraisal 
valuation study. This process will take place over a period of 3 years, from June 1, 2016 
to July 1, 2019." 

Do we know if they have plans to? 

ANSWER: Since they asked for the entire $2M for the above project, we would assume 
they are not submitting any further projects, however we are not sure. 


And have they asked (& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, and If so, 
what did they use those $s for?

Subject: RE: FDCVT- Flint 


Tom, 


Below are the answers to your questions, if you have any further questions, let us know. Thank you. 


Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these (FDCVT) $s ? 

ANSWER: We received an application from the City of Flint on September 17 th . The amount requested for the project is 
$2M (the limit for a local unit) and it is estimated to take $3.1M to complete the entire project. They also indicated that 
if full funding is not awarded, it is doubtful that they will be able to move forward with the project. The proposed 
project is: 

"The city proposes to hire a qualified contractor to provide property assessing services. Specifically, this 
contractor will create digital property sketches of all improved properties, evaluate existing property conditions 
and improvements by providing real property data verification, and conduct a comprehensive appraisal 

valuation study. This process will take place over a period of 3 years, from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2019." 


Do we know if they have plans to? 

ANSWER: Since they asked for the entire $2M for the above project, we would assume they are not submitting any 
further projects, however we are not sure. 


And have they asked {& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, and if so, what did they use those $s for? 

ANSWER: Treasury awarded Flint two grants in FY 2015 under the FDCVT program. Treasury has not yet received any 
reimbursement requests from the City. Therefore, we have not distributed any of the FDCVT grant related funds to the 
City. The two grants are: 


Awarded

Water Pollution Control incinerator Shutdown 

Water system enhancements through

$900,000

The writeup below was included in Flint Water Talking Points from last winter. 


The City has received significant financial assistance through both grant programs and bond 
restructuring initiatives administered by the Ml Department of Treasury. This financial 
assistance has allowed the City to replace miles of aged pipeline and begin efforts to install a 
specialized filter at the Water Treatment Plant. 

In February, Flint was awarded a total of $2 million through two Financially Distressed Cities, 
Villages, and Townships Grants. $1.1 million was awarded for water system enhancements 
through improved waste management while $900,000 was awarded for water system 
enhancements through leak detection and pipe assessments.

To be honest I am not sure... I don't have the history/background to know whether we would actually turn 
them/communities down ( & we might) if they can't fully fund their project. I am sure that area (assessing) is in chaos 
as 'well in Flint. 

If that 'were the case l.e., we would say no to the assessing project; then yes in terms of the switch to water related 
projects. I think the number I heard yesterday was 10,000-15,000 filters for $?.50k. Or maybe you create a program 
to replace the curb-to-home lead piping. 

The call with Flint got cancelled today. They are not available now at that time.

Thanks. Are you suggesting they modify their request to one that asks for money for filters instead of the assessing 
since the assessing cost, exceeds the grant and they couldn't do the project anyway?

One of my 'take-awavs' from the meeting this afternoon was to follow up on whether they could 
use those Distressed Cities' $s for filters. Remember last year they did receive $2mm which they 
used for water related items. This year they want funds for the property assessing area. Their 
project cost is more than the grant limit It is not clear they realize that. The deadline application is 
Oct 15 if they were willing to change the application. Assuming that is doable. 

With Wayne away ( and before the 1:00 mtg}... a call was set up actually earlier today with Natasha 
Henderson. Do you care if we still do that ? The email setting it up is attached. Obviously we are 
not going to commit to anything. 


Let me know if you need anything else.

Attached is a letter that was sent to the City of Flint today regarding possible 
reconnection to the Water Supply System in response to an initial inquiry by Ms. 
Henderson, Flint's City Administrator and Ms. McCormick. As you may imagine 
the dialog that has begun is at a very preliminary stage, available information may 
be limited and outdated to some degree, and Ms. Henderson has asked that we not 
make a public release at this time. With that request in mind, we have asked the 
communications team to refer all press call to either Ms. McCormick or me. We 
will keep you updated as this issue develops.

I talked with Dayne Walling at length today a few minutes ago, and Harvey and I had separate meetings with one of the 
Flint minister groups and then Rep. Neely. Our conversations were cordial for the most with the normal concerns being 
expressed. I told Rep. Neely that I felt he hadn't gotten enough respect and insight into our thoughts on this and we 
expanded our backgrounder for him and he was very appreciative. He actually cancelled a Black Caucus meeting called 
for today on this due to Harvey and our meeting. I have Dan and Nick calling him just to update. 

More importantly, we have the proposal back from DWSD for a reconnect: 

1. Short term reconnect is ok until KWA starts operating; 

2. No reconnect fee and immediate reconnect; 

3. Expenses incurred at actual cost although no estimate at this time 

4. A fixed monthly rate of $662,100 + a commodity rate of $8.93mcf for current 15-16 FY; 

5. Rate is over and above water sales to Genesee County Drain Commission; 

6. A water wholesale adjustment; 

7. Only extends to Flint; 

8. Rates for 16-17 FY would be the same as other customers. 

Mayor Duggan is more than willing to lend his support. 

I'm asking Saxton for a ballpark calculation. We would have to find them the money for this reconnect, but Dayne is 
more than open (as is Ananich to a lesser degree) to finding some revolving fund that they would repay perhaps on an 
extended basis or maybe using some guarantee to reduce the borrowing costs.

RE: Release on Flint 


What if they are shut ins or can't get there? Where's the relief coming from? Is the Flint Transit Authority willing to 
extend complimentary transportation? W f ho is going to explain to the recipients how the filter fits on their faucet? 

1 know from experience that my wife never grew up building things out of Erector Sets, and she's terrible at reading 
"part a attaches to part b with two bolts enclosed in the third packet. Don't use the ones marked only for Delta faucets" 
oh, you get the point. 


Just a suggestion from a syntax point of view, the construction of the first sentence appears to allow anyone who is a 
DHHS client and anyone who is a Flint resident to receive a water filter. It isn't clear that it applies to a person who is a 
Flint resident who receives public assistance and not to other Flint residents. Secondly, don't forget that other Flint 
residents also should be entitled to a water filter and although the press release is about DHHS clients, we don't want to 
create additional confusion, A throw-away line about the other residents might be wise.

Talked at length with Geraiyn about this just now. Think is a good thing, and shows immediate follow up from action 
steps announced Friday. Added bonus is that it should be pretty easy for Flint clients and residents and have a "no 
wrong door" approach too just in case. Please see attached and below. 

This is slated for distribution at. 4 p.rn, Need to hear if any concerns from anyone ASAP. 


Otherwise, it's a go. 


Thanks much,

Subject: Release on Flint 
Importance: High 

Attached is the draft release we would like to issue ASAP regarding the new plan for water filter distribution in the city 
of Flint. 

At a meeting with multiple community partners today, our local MDHHS office realized they could do distribution from 
the 2 Flint offices as long as the local community action agency could assist them in storing the larger quantities of 
filters. 

Locally, the groups will be issuing a press release from the local health department discussing distribution, but we feel it 
is important to also send this from MDHHS. 

We are happy to discuss this with Ron Fonger if you want him to be the first press call we make once we issue it.

Re: Flint water 


Sounds like the best solution. In essence you are extending the maturity because it extends the debt repayment 
schedule.

We (Treasury) think we can restructure the drinking water loans the City currently has. Essentially this

I am rounding the numbers... originally they had 4 loans totally $40+mm. The current amt outstanding 
is about $20mm. The cash benefit of deferring the principle payts is approx. $2. 1mm. 

I had talked to Jerry A. re where they would use the money. One possibility would be the consultant 
they are looking hire. The other is to pay for that pipeline replacement he talked about. 

I talked to Jim Sygo @ DEQ to see if they had any issues because they are responsible for the program 
side. He checked with his staff. They had some concerns about opening up 'Pandora's Box' i.e., other 
distress communities would want to do this. But at the end of the day I think they 
would ok the deferral particularly if you (the Gov's office) supported it. Jim had left me a v-mail so I can 
get back to him Monday to really confirm.

Flint Hires International Urban Water Experts of 
Veolia North America to Assess City’s Water Issues 


i 



Flint, Michigan - February 10, 2015 - The City of Flint has retained a team of urban water experts 
from Veolia North America to conduct an analysis of the city’s water system. Veolia, which is 
the world’s largest water services and technology company, will assess how Flint’s water is 
tested and distributed, including reviewing water treatment processes and operations, laboratory 
testing and analysis, and engineering reports that detail the city’s treatment and distribution 
systems. 

“We understand the frustration and urgency in Flint,” said David Gadis, vice president of Veolia 
North America’s Municipal & Commercial Business. “We are honored to support your 
community with our technical expertise so that together we can ensure water quality for the 
people of the city of Flint.” 

Veolia anticipates its analysis to take less than two weeks, at which time they will present 
findings to City officials, including the Mayor, City Council and the Emergency Manager. Once 
the findings are presented, city officials will determine how to move forward. 

"Addressing the City's water challenges are the top priority right now and it is important to bring 
in an independent, highly qualified team to work with us to address the safety and quality 
issues,” said Mayor Dayne Walling. 

“Until we have completed our analysis, we cannot say for certain how long it will take to provide 
solutions to Flint’s current water situation,” said Gadis. “We have extensive experience handling 
challenging river water sources, reducing leaks and contaminants and in managing discolored 
water.” 

“Veolia worked diligently to respond to our Request For Proposal in a thorough, professional 
way and demonstrated the ability to immediately support us as we ensure safe, clean water for 
our residents,” said Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. 

The Veolia team hit the ground running Tuesday morning, meeting with water officials to 
provide an overview of the work to be conducted. “We look forward to helping Flint’s team find 
ways to address and improve the city’s drinking water operation,” Gadis said. 

The company designs and provides water, waste and energy management solutions to 
communities and industries across the country, including providing water and wastewater

For Immediate Release 


Flint Hires International Urban Water Experts of 
Veolia North America to Assess City’s Water Issues 


Flint, Michigan - February 10, 2015 - The City of Flint has retained 
a team of urban water experts from Veolia North America to 
conduct an analysis of the city’s water system. Veolia, which is the 
world’s largest water services and technology company, will 
assess how Flint’s water is tested and distributed, including 
reviewing water treatment processes and operations, laboratory 
testing and analysis, and engineering reports that detail the city’s 
treatment and distribution systems. 

“We understand the frustration and urgency in Flint,” said David 
Gadis, vice president of Veolia North America’s Municipal & 
Commercial Business. “We are honored to support your 
community with our technical expertise so that together we can 
ensure water quality for the people of the city of Flint.” 

Veolia anticipates its analysis to take less than two weeks, at which 
time they will present findings to City officials, including the 
Mayor, City Council and the Emergency Manager. Once the 
findings are presented, city officials will determine how to move 
forward.

"Addressing the City's water challenges are the top priority right 
now and it is important to bring in an independent, highly qualified 
team to work with us to address the safety and quality issues,” said 
Mayor Dayne Walling. 

“Until we have completed our analysis, we cannot say for certain 
how long it will take to provide solutions to Flint’s current water 
situation,” said Gadis. “We have extensive experience handling 
challenging river water sources, reducing leaks and contaminants 
and in managing discolored water.” 

“Veolia worked diligently to respond to our Request For Proposal 
in a thorough, professional way and demonstrated the ability to 
immediately support us as we ensure safe, clean water for our 
residents,” said Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. 

The Veolia team hit the ground running Tuesday morning, meeting 
with water officials to provide an overview of the work to be 
conducted. “We look forward to helping Flint’s team find ways to 
address and improve the city’s drinking water operation,” Gadis 
said. 

The company designs and provides water, waste and energy 
management solutions to communities and industries across the 
country, including providing water and wastewater services to 530 
communities in North America. More information is available at

This is an old note which summarizes some of the early issues with the system and why they wanted to go to the 
KWA, Thought you might be interested. Did we get any info for the ministers about how the Detroit bili extensions and 
cut offs are working?

Subject: Flint Water Bills 

Dennis, 

There is some information attached on the Flint water issue you asked us about. I summarize a few of the key 
points: 

• The water system has been running at deficits tor years. When the previous EFM left the City in 2004, the 
water system has a reserve of approximately $60 million. When Mike Brown was appointed, this had turned 
into a $20 million deficit due to years of not passing along to consumers the rate increases of over 10% 
hitting the system from DWSD. Slides 5 & 6 of the attached power point show this pretty dramatically. 

• Substantial increases over the past few years are an attempt to reflect the actual costs of running the system. 

• Another concern raised by DHS was the increase in the deposit for rental properties. This was necessary 
because renters paid the previous $100 deposit, then racked up water bills in excess of this amount and 
walked away. Of the affidavits currently out there, 82% are past due. I would also note that this is not 
mandatory, it is only required if a landlord is not willing to put the water bill in their name. 

• The bottom line is that they realize it is an issue, but the General Fund doesn’t have the money to run 
general City operations, much less subsidize water rates. 

The two page word document (attached) provided by the EFM gives you a good overview of what is going on. 
They believe that a switch to KWA is part of the solution for high water rates in the City.

City Of Flint Water History Facts 


Current Treatment Plant was put into service in 1954. 

Current 72” main pipeline was completed in 1970. 

Flint signed a 30 year contract with Detroit Water and Sewer Department in the mid 1 960’s. 

The contract with DWSD has expired and we are currently operating on a yearly extension. 

In 2006 Flint completed a $48,000,000 upgrade of the existing Water Plant (required by the MDEQ & for backup only). 

Flint’s Water & Sewer System is approximately a $300,000,000 Enterprise. 

Flint’s Water & Sewer System is designed to deliver water to over 200,000 people with over 1 ,500 miles of infrastructure. 
Flint’s most recent census count shows a population of approximately 1 02,000 in 201 0. 

Flint’s census population in 2000 was approximately 124,000. 

The water system had over 45,000 customers in June of 1999. 

The water system had just over 36,000 customers by June 2011 . 

The “Fixed Costs” that must be covered to maintain the system and deliver quality water have increased over time.

> Will help identify repair area’s 


■ Reduce water theft 


■ Replace water meters 

> We currently have an eighteen month plan to replace all meters with more efficient “Smart Meiers” 

■ Encourage routine household checks 

> “Faulty” toilets are a significant reason for household water loss, and unexpected larger bills.

Response to Treasury regarding water rates, etc. 


The cost of water and sewer in the City of Flint has become one of the most vexing issues 
facing the Emergency Financial Manager. When the Emergency Manager was appointed 
in December 2011 the water system had a $20 million deficit. In order to address this 
deficit the EM was forced to increase water and sewer rates by over a combined 120% in 
the past 18 months. 

When the previous EFM left the City in 2004, the water system has a reserve of 
approximately $60 million. In the intervening years several things occurred: for three of 
five years (2007-2011) no rate increases were passed along to customers even though 
Detroit charged increases of over 10% per year; in the years when increases were passed 
along those amounts did not equal the actual cost of the system; the City chose to use the 
equity built up in the Water and Sewer funds until that was no longer available; a large 
lawsuit was settled; the City must pay for the $48 million MDEQ upgrades required at 
the Water Treatment Plant; and unbilled or unpaid water and sewer charges increased 
significantly. 

In the past 18 months water and sewer rates have been increased to reflect the actual costs 
to operate the water and sewer system. Major leaks in the distribution system have been 
repaired. Unpaid water and sewer usage is now being addressed and the water affidavit 
process is part of this problem. 

The City of Flint currently allows landlords to put the water and sewer billing in the name 
of the renter. This affidavit process holds the landlord harmless for any water costs. The 
deposit for the affidavit has been set at $100, which is the lowest in the County. The 
deposit fees in the County range from a low of $100 to a high of $500. The City is 
raising its rate to $350, which puts us about in the middle of the range. Depending on 
usage, this will cover 60 to 90 days’ water charges and reduce the amount of uncollected 
billing. Keep in mind, any water not paid for is eventually charged to those who do pay 
through increased rates. 

Because the deposit is so low in relation to the current charges, renters quickly owe more 
than the deposit, and find it easier to simply walk away from the rental and forfeit the 
deposit. This results in the City being on the hook for the unpaid bills. Currently there 
are 4,893 affidavits, and 4029 of them (82%) past due. This facctor alone totals to just 
under $3 million. In addition, when the renter walks away, the City has no way of 
knowing that the property is vacant. Many times the landlord rents the property again, 
without filing an affidavit, and the water continues to be charged to the former renter, 
again adding uncollected bills to the City. In the past the collection rate for past due 
accounts, when turned over to a collection agency, has been about 3% on average. Keep 
in mind that this is a deposit, not a fee, and can be refunded when the renter leaves the 
property. Also, the landlord can avoid the renter’s deposit requirement by keeping the 
water and sewer billing in his name. 

The City is also studying the potential to hold the landlord accountable for the water 
charges under certain conditions, such as failure to notify the City when a renter leaves 
and then renting the property again without filiing a new affidavit. 



The City recognizes that the high cost of water is a factor which is causing low income 
residents to choose to leave the City and the increase in the deposit fee might accelerate 
that choice. However, many of the surrounding communities charge a higher deposit than 
does the City o Flint. Renters are leaving the City because they can get better housing for 
less money, live in safer neighborhoods with better schools, have their water charges 
decrease by about half, and have their insurance rates reduced by approximately 50%. 

Water and sewer costs have resulted in about 8,000 current customers to be more than 60 
days past due. Many are senior citizens who have lived in Flint their entire life, paid their 
taxes, etc. and now find themselves unable to pay their water bill. This concerns the City 
more than the issue of deposits. We have put in place for this year the ability for citizens 
to direct a part of their city tax refund to help people with their water bills, and we are 
reviewing other options as well as scheduled meetings with agencies involved in helping 
low income people with their bills. 

We further recognize that we have staffing issues and water theft to address. The City is 
able to complete about 120 water shut-offs per week. At that rate we can not keep up 
with delinquent account shut-offs. The city also reconginzes that water theft through 
meter by-pass or unauthorized turn-on must be resolved. 

Ultimately, the City must find a way to hold down future increases in the cost of water, to 
bring them more in line with the Genesee County water customers. To this end the City 
has recommended to Treasury, that the City leave the Detroit Water System and join 
KWA with Genesee County, Lapeer and Sanilac Counties and the City of Lapeer. We 
believe this is the most significant long term factor in stabilizing costs to the water 
customers in the City of Flint.

Attached is the release with the proper date. 


For Immediate Release 


Recent Tests Show Flint Water within EPA Guidelines 


Flint, Michigan - February 27, 2015 - The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(MDEQ) Testing lab has provided results to the City of Flint showing that test results for TTHM 
levels for the month of February are well within EPA guidelines for safe water. All eight testing 
sites showed levels of TTHM ranging between 14.9 and 28.5 micrograms per liter (pg/L), well 
below the Maximum Contamination Level of 80 (see chart below). 


l 



The testing results confirm the progress made by the City to address concerns regarding the 
safety of its water supply and corroborates findings by the City and independent tests by other 
organizations that the water today is safe. “Flint’s water supply is meeting all safety guidelines 
set forth by the EPA,” said DPW Director Howard Croft. “Today’s findings by the MDEQ 
reinforce the progress we have made, and should help rebuild confidence in the safety of Flint’s 
drinking water. We still have work to do to improve water quality and are committed to being 
vigilant to assure that water safety is maintained.” 

These results also show that the four month average for test results is now within EPA guidelines 
for five of the eight testing areas in the City. However, because EPA regulations require that the 
four month average for all testing sites be within guidelines, the City of Flint will still be 
considered to be out of compliance by MDEQ. The City expects to receive notice within the next 
few weeks indicating non-compliance, and system users can expect to receive official notice of 
non-compliance in the month of March. 

Meanwhile, the City continues to work on maintaining water safety and improving water quality. 
While steps are being taken daily to improve quality, the City is expecting a formal set of 
recommendations from its water quality experts within the next few weeks. 

The detail of the study results, a report of the progress being made and preliminary 
recommendations from Veolia will be shared with the newly formed Water Advisory Committee 
and Water Technical Committee, whose first meetings are scheduled for next week.

» Good Afternoon, 

» 

» Thank you for returning my call on the other day! Again, my concern as is others in the City of Flint, Michigan 
regarding the drinking water source for the water customers of the City of Flint. I have enclosed one of the lasted article 
written by the local newspaper, "The Flint Journal" regarding the Flint River water. Needless to say, the water is 
dangerous to our health! GM will not use the water at its Engine Plant in Flint to wash engines parts! 

» 

» We need your help to guide us to the profession people that know about "Bad Drinking Water and Environmental 
Racism". I truly believe it's "Environmental Racism" at its worst or should I say best! As a resident of flint, Past President 
of the Flint Branch NAACP, newly elected VP of the Flint Branch NAACP and the most listen to broadcast host during that 
time on Flint's premiere gospel station, WFLT 1420AM, each Saturday morning from 9:30-10AM, I have challenged our 
elected officials to step up to the plate and fix this water problem! 

» 

» I'll be asking the Executive Committee of the Flint Branch of the NAACP to request from our National Office if we can 
proceed with a possible "Environmental Racism" lawsuit with their assistance and the assistance of other civil rights 
groups and others to "file briefs in support of our efforts against those parties involved with the changing and the using 
of the Flint River as our water drinking source. 

» 

» The City of Flint has Emergency Manager #4 since our "takeover", and cares less about the residents or the water 
concerns of its Customers of Flint! Please help us with our problem by directing us to the right professional people. 
Please go to www.actionpa.org/fluroride/ej. html<http://www.actionpa.org/fluroride/ej.html> regarding "Environmental 
Racism" I have attached an article from the Flint Journal, and may Google other articles regarding the Flint's water

Fwd: Contaminated Drink Water if Flint 


I have become increasingly concerned about the situation in Flint and the lack of empathy for the residen ts. I'm 
not sure that buying water from Ice Mountain or Bill Young makes sense and I don't know about HU since 
they buy it from Bill or local sources and repackage. But, it would seem to me that buying some and giving it 
to residents who are having discoloration or smell issues would be fair and prudent until it gets ironed 
out. Maybe this doesn't make any sense to you and if not just chalk it up to the delirium I'm feeling from the 
sun and drop the idea. 


Harvey feels the situation is slipping out of hand without some direct response and so does Kelly 
Rossman. She's talking to Beth today. I worry that swooping in may reinforce the idea that there is something 
wrong with the water after all. But, it seems to me that that would be small issue compared to blowing off these 
ministers and their concerns. Of course, we can't supply the water forever so maybe working with Wayne 
something can be figured out.

Good Afternoon, Attorney Randall! 


Thank you for returning my call on the other day! Again, my concern as is others 
in the City of Flint, Michigan regarding the drinking water source for the water 
customers of the City of Flint. I have enclosed one of the lasted article written by 
the local newspaper, "The Flint Journal" regarding the Flint River water. Needless 
to say, the water is dangerous to our health! GM will not use the water at its 
Engine Plant in Flint to wash engines parts! 


We need your help to guide us to the profession people that know about "Bad 
Drinking Water and Environmental Racism". I truly believe it's "Environmental 
Racism" at its worst or should I say best! As a resident of flint, Past President of 
the Flint Branch NAACP, newly elected VP of the Flint Branch NAACP and the 
most listen to broadcast host during that time on Flint's premiere gospel station, 
WFLT 1420AM, each Saturday morning from 9:3 0-1 0AM, I have challenged our 
elected officials to step up to the plate and fix this water problem! 


I'll be asking the Executive Committee of the Flint Branch of the NAACP to 
request from our National Office if we can proceed with a possible 
"Environmental Racism" lawsuit with their assistance and the assistance of other 
civil rights groups and others to "file briefs in support of our efforts against those 
parties involved with the changing and the using of the Flint River as our water 
drinking source. 


The City of Flint has Emergency Manager #4 since our "takeover", and cares less 
about the residents or the water concerns of its Customers of Flint! Please help us 
with our problem by directing us to the right professional people. Please go to 
www.actionpa.org/fluroride/ej . html<htt p ://www.actionpa.org/fluroride/ej.htm{> 
regarding "Environmental Racism" I have attached an article from the Flint 
Journal, and may Google other articles regarding the Flint's water source, 
including how we arrived to where we are on today. 


Thank you very much in advance! ! 


I remain. 



Concerned Resident

[§§m probably buys and repackages from Ice Mountain or Absopure (of course it could be from a local source). I just 
think it is prudent to have a Plan B if it gets out of hand. Seems like that's where some of the ministers could be 
particularly helpful if they want to be. You, Beth and Harvey are the best thinkers we've got and closest to the situation 
so your judgment makes sense. Jerry Ambrose has dealt with these kinds of things a zillion times in Lansing with Rev. 
Stone here so he's had experience. I just don't want it to get away from us so that when it turns warmer they create a 
crisis.

You are trying to work through a potentially difficult situation with Flint water and the local ministers demands 
(although I frankly tend to have sympathy with them) and you should just be talking about it with the Colonel. Might be 
good to anticipate what will happen when it gets warm and we have more water problems. I left you with a doozy of a 
situation and Flarvey and Workman/Saxton are really at odds on this one.

Next week sometime can Wayne & I have a follow up conversation with you re Flint water? Wayne & I had a call with 
Brad W. @ DEQ. Fie is getting back to us re some of the items on your list. So maybe mid-week? 

I think the bottom line is Wayne, Brad & I (we would "volunteer") to meet with your minister group here in Lansing [to 
the extent we can] provide info to some of the issues they raised with you. It may be better that you are not at the 
meeting. Of course that is your call but maybe let us 'peons' do it. FJarvey could be there in your stead; since he knows 
them. I am sure whatever we convey they probably won't be happy.

Wayne- 

We need to have more discussion relating to Flint water. There seem to be even more issues regarding the water than 
there should be. I'll have a series of questions that I really need some answers to if you can have someone who 
understands the problems there. The people there just seem to be getting a raw deal from the city particularly in terms 
of the information they are getting. I know you are as worried about their health as I am so we kind of need to get 
answers to some of these concerns.

NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 

TO: Randall Byrne, State Administrative Manager; Office of Fiscal Responsibility 

FROM: Eric Cline, Department Manager; Office of Fiscal Responsibility 

SUBJECT : Questions Regarding City of Flint Water System 

DATE: July 28, 2015 


RICK SNYDER 
GOVERNOR 


State of Michigan 

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY 

Lansing 


At a July 23, 2015 meeting, Deputy Treasurer Workman posed several questions regarding the City of 
Flint’s water system. This memo is a response to those questions. 

The annual cost to the City of Flint to reconnect to the DWSD system 

In a March 3, 2015 memo to Deputy Treasurer Workman, Emergency Manager Ambrose noted that he 
had been informed by DWSD that such a reconnection would immediately levy a fixed cost on the City of 
$10. 1 -million per year. 

Actual water purchases would be in addition to the fixed cost fee and would be dependent upon actual 
usage, but the annual cost was estimated to be as high as $1 -million/month; making the entire total of a 
one year connection back to DWSD as high as $22-million. This cost would be reduced to approximately 
$ 19-million/year once the City’s $3-million annual expense of operating the water system itself was 
offset. 

These calculations were outlined in a March 2015 memo from the Emergency Manager to Deputy 
Treasurer Workman and update cost projections provided in a February 1 1, 2015 memo to Chief Deputy 
Treasurer Tom Saxton. 

The Emergency Manager also stated his concern that for the City to be able to pay these costs that water 
rates charged to Flint residents would need to be increased by a minimum of 30%. Water rate increases 
between 2010 and 2015 are illustrated in the table attached. 

In addition, DWSD was requiring that the City of Flint negotiate a 30-year contract for the provision of 
back-up services. 

The City of Flint’s degree of participation in the management of the KWA system 

Mayor Dayne Walling is the City's official representative to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). 

The participation of the Mayor as the official representative for the City of Flint is established in the 
KWA Articles of Incorporation. Mayor Walling is the current Chair of the Board of the KWA Board of 
Directors. 

Continued use of Flint River water after the City is connected to the KWA system 


P.O. BOX 30716 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909 
www.michigan.gov/treasury • (517) 373-3200 




Page 2 


The City Administrator has confirmed that once the City is fully connected to the KWA system they will 
no longer continue to use Flint River water. 

The Flint River, however, will be the City’s primary back-up water source in the event that a major 
disruption in the KWA system temporarily prevents the City from receiving water. 

The process used to hire Veolia 

Veolia responded on January 29, 2015, to a Request for Proposal issued by the City of Flint. Emergency 
Manager Ambrose made the final decision to retain Veolia. 

The importance of hydrant flushing 

Fire hydrant flushing is an important part of distribution system maintenance. It is useful in determining 
flow conditions in water mains. 

According to information from the American Water Works Association (AWWA), there are two types of 
hydrant flushing utilized. The most comprehensive method is fire-flow testing. 

Fire-flow testing requires hydrants to be opened, flushed, pressure and flow data to be collected and the 
potential fire flow at a particular point in a water main to be determined. 

Hydrant flushing pennits any debris to be cleared from a water main. They process of collecting fire flow 
data allows the determination of water pressure and flow capabilities for fighting fires at any location 
w ithin a distribution system. It can also help determine the general condition of a system by detecting 
reduced water flows in a given area. 

Status of the GAC carbon filter installation 

Six of the twelve filters will be operational by no later than the first week of August. 

Activation of the filters is expected to immediately drop the levels of TTHM within the system. 

The remaining six filters are projected to be installed and operational by the end of August. 

Status of the DuPont Street Water Main Replacement 

After an internal review, the City made the decision to rebid this project. 

There were multiple reasons for this decision, which included interference with current road projects, the 
determination that project bids were too high, and bidding timelines which were not favorable to secure 
quality bids or contractors. 

This project will be rebid by the City later this fiscal year. 

If you have any questions or need additional information on this topic, let me know. Thank you.

Harvey- 



Treasury gave us the financial info and KWA info the ministers wanted last week and Tom and Wayne are 
coming to the meeting. Brad has the test results and the science guy to explain the lead issue and you have the 
filters (I'd keep that to yourself and bring one to the meeting so you can be a hero). Frankly, I don't see what 
else we can do. They aren't paying more, the water is ok, and KWA is the long term answer. If they don't like 
the Mayor, the primary is Tuesday and we really can't get involved in that.

Harvey - 


We are all set. [KESgi 
ifeiEM can serve as 
liaison on this 
one. The merchant 
team can source 1,500 
filters. We will get 
them to the 
community at 
cost. My guess is this 
will be $20k or so, but 
the team will give you 
a final number. 


Because we don't 
want to be a state 
vendor, we won't sell 
them to you. 
will work out logistics 
of whether we make a 
donation of gift cards 
to the state that you 
use to purchase them. 


3 








or whether there is 
some other entity to 
which we can give 
them. 


Given all the 
circumstances, we are 
not interested in any 
publicity. We want it 
to be clear that the 
state is pr oviding 
these, notB'" 


Thanks for reaching 
out.

water filters to Flint 
residents to assist 
with the quality

A few weeks ago, you

check with your 
suppliers regarding 
price. I apologize for 
taking long to send

1 . Original Fact Sheet 
DWSDvs.KWA: 5/1/12 

2. KWA Fact Sheet: 9/1/15

VIA EMAIL: 





Revised 5/1/12 


Fact Sheet 
City of Flint 
DWSD versus KWA 

Issue: City of Flint joining Karegnondi Water Authority and leaving City of Detroit water 

system 

Fact: Both the City of Flint and City of Detroit operate their water system via enterprise funds. 

The water fund does not impact either community’s general fund. Leaving the water 
system will not impact the general fund. 

Fact: The City of Flint is a suburban customer of Detroit. If Flint leaves, it only impacts the 

suburban customer rate, not Detroit’s. 

Fact: Detroit’s own plan calls for (latest available estimate) $ 1 .2 billion dollar improvements 

to supply redundancy to Flint. If Flint leaves, Detroit avoids this construction cost. 

Fact: Detroit and DWSD have experienced bond rating decreases in recent months. If Flint 

leaves, DWSD avoids a new bond issue and eliminates a capital project from its master 
plan improving its financial outlook. 

Fact: Delivering water to Flint from DWSD is expensive. If Flint leaves, DWSD can reduce 

its operating and maintenance costs to its contracted customers. 

Fact: DWSD has a limited capacity for water treatment and delivery. If Flint leaves, the City 

can resell that volume to other customers. 

Fact: DWSD has multiple drinking water treatment plants. Some are more expensive to 

operate and maintain than others. Without a commitment to Flint, its largest customer 
other than the City of Detroit, DWSD may choose to discontinue operation of one or 
more of its current facilities and realize significant cost reductions to the overall system. 

Fact: Flint is not part of the DWSD sewer system. The City of Flint leaving has no impact on 

the sewer system. 

Fact: The creation of tire KWA system will create over 1,000 construction jobs in Michigan. 

Design and construction of the system will take 42 months from July 2012 through 
December 2015. 

Fact: KWA is offering a fixed rate for capital to its customers. Flint joining KWA will give 

the City a stable rate for upwards of 20 years. 

Fact: KWA will offer raw water to the region. Raw water is not enhanced with chemicals, 

which is undesirable to agribusiness. 

Fact: The 1-69 corridor/I-75 corridor crosses in Flint. Along with CN and CSX and the 

pipeline aerotropolis, Flint can be a major transportation center for agribusiness. KWA

Fact: 


DWSD does not serve the Thumb region. KWA with its partners will be able to serve 
both the population with its basic needs: drinJdng water and the businesses with large 
quantities of process (raw) water. 

DWSD is the only water supplier for over 4 million residents of the state. The creation 
of the KWA will create a second water supply system thereby reducing the impact of 
terrorist attacks on water supplies. With a mutual aid agreement between DWSD and 
KWA, the system could complement each other. 

DWSD does not provide water supply to major portions of the KWA service area. 
KWA will provide local municipalities in the thumb region with an alternative water 
supply to the Arsenic impacted well systems. 

In addition, local communities can replace groundwater systems with KWA surface 
water system and thereby improve local groundwater levels. 

The KWA system will provide fire protection service to regions currently not served. 

The current DWSD water system has over 20% water loss in its system. KWA’s water 
supply is expected to have less than a 5% water loss. KWA will provide a more 
effective use of the waters of the state. 

KWA provides redundant water supply to Flint. Currently, DWSD only provides a 
single source to Flint. KWA provides multiple supply sources to Flint at a fraction of 
the cost. 


KWA has offered to purchase excess infrastructure from DWSD. If Flint leaves, Detroit 
has 25 miles of watermain it no longer needs. KWA has offered to purchase the pipeline 
and enter into a long-term arrangement for purchase of water from DWSD. 

Each incorporating municipality in KWA will pay the same rate for raw water; therefore, 
each community will set its own treatment standards and exert local control of the cost 
of water it provides to its citizens. 

Lapeer and Sanilac Counties are facing depletion of their groundwater supplies. 



C r © & te cl ^ / 1 /-jI 0 1. S 

Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) Fact Sheet 

• KWA is incorporated by the State of Michigan, comprised of the City of Flint, City of 
Lapeer, Genesee County, Lapeer County, and Sanilac County. 

• As specified in its Articles of Incorporation, each of these constituent municipalities has one 
representative to the board - specifically the Mayors or their designees of the 2 cities (Flint 
and Lapeer), the Drain Commissioners or their designees from each of the counties (Sanilac, 
Lapeer, and Genesee). 

• KWA will deliver raw water to customer utilities. 

• Each governmental unit will still own and operate their respective treatment and distribution 
systems. GCDC will have no jurisdiction over the City of Flint water. Flint will have all 
franchise rights for sale and treatment of water from KWA within the City of Flint. 

® Each community that obligates itself to the debt for construction of the KWA infrastructure 
pipeline, intake and pump stations, receives commensurate voting membership to the board. 

• Flint’s debt obligation is based on the volume as selected by the city. 

• Additional members are appointed by their respective communities. 

• All board members serve without compensation. 

» KWA will operate with 5 to 7 full-time equivalent employees. KWA will contract its labor 
force. 

• To date, only the City of Flint and Genesee County have bought capacity in the project. 

® Once KWA water is available, each community receiving untreated Lake Huron water from 
KWA will pay a share of the operating costs, he.: electricity, labor, maintenance, and 
chemicals in proportion to the volume of water they receive. 



KWA has created a capacity of 60 million gallons per day (mg). 


Created 9/1/2015 


• Flint has purchased 18.0 mgd. Genesee County has purchased 42 mgd. Each purchaser 
pays based on their purchased capacity. The total project cost will be divided by 60 (total 
capacity) and each purchaser, Flint and Genesee, will pay the same price per unit. 

• The operation and maintenance cost will also be charged based upon the volume purchased 
annually. 

• If a community exceeds capacity, it must either purchase or rent capacity from a community 
with excess. 

• There exists a 30 day rolling average, which will determine if any community exceeds 
purchased capacity. Water volume purchased for capacity purposes will be calculated on 
the basis of a 30-day average. 

o Capital costs for Flint will be a flat rate of approximately $6.8 million over 30 years. 

• To date, KWA is below its construction cost projection of $274 million. 

• 90 percent of the KWA pipeline route is constructed along public right of ways. 

• Any land required, that was outside the road right-of-way, was purchased from the original 
land owners, not a 3 rd party short-term owner. 

• All KWA construction contracts have been publically and competitively bid. 

• No tax dollars, (Federal, State, or Local) are being used to fund this project. All project 
costs for KWA are being paid by the Flint and Genesee County water users.

Thank you. It doesn't surprise me that we have another hurdle in all of this. I appreciate your acknowledgement that 
GCDC will do everything in its power to help the people of Flint in this effort to reconnect to DWSD. Our first objective 
is to restore the health of the people, then their trust, and of course these objectives are partially accomplished through 
the reconnect and the efforts of your client.

Re: Increase in average day and maximum peak day by GCDC 

Dear Mr. Wolfson: 

The Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s Office, Division of Water and Waste Services 
(“GCDC”) has been working diligently to fulfill the demands of the various state and federal agencies, 
Governor Snyder, and the people of the City of Flint (“Flint”), to provide Flint with water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (“DWSD”). These efforts include placing approximately seven 
(7) miles of the seventy-two inch (72”) water transmission pipeline (“Pipeline”) that GCDC purchased 
from Flint back into service, pressurizing the Pipeline, disinfecting the Pipeline, flushing the Pipeline, and 
performing Bac-T testing on the water inside of the Pipeline. Once these efforts have materialized and 
GCDC has received two (2) negative Bac-T tests, GCDC will be in a tactical position to furnish DWSD 
water to Flint as early as midweek. 

On October 8, 2015, I sent you a letter after GCDC received a formal request from Flint for 
GCDC to provide DWSD water to Flint pursuant to a previous written agreement between GCDC and 
Flint. As of today, I have not received your response. In the October 8, 2015, letter I requested the 
following: 

GCDC has received a formal request from Flint to receive DWSD water via GCDC per 
GCDC’s contract with Flint. GCDC’s rates are currently based on 12 mgd average day 
and 25 mgd maximum peak day. Does DWSD have the capacity to increase demand to 
GCDC to 28.5 mgd average day and 51 mgd peak day? If so, could you please provide 
GCDC with the rates for 28.5 mgd average and 51 mgd peak day through June 30, 2016? 

Attorney Anthony Chubb from Flint has provided me with a proposed WATER SERVICE 
CONTRACT BETWEEN CITY OF DETROIT AND CITY OF FLINT (“Contract”). Dus Contract 
makes the assumption that Flint has a separate connection to the DWSD water distribution system. The 
interconnect between the DWSD water system and the Flint water system is owned by GCDC. Flint does 
not have a separate connection to the DWSD water distribution system. Any water that Flint receives 


WWW . MCGRAWHORRIS . CO M 




McGraw Morris P.C, 


Mr. Wolfson 
October 12, 2015 
Page 2 

from DWSD is required to flow through GN-01. Additionally, GCDC has received no communication 
from DWSD on this subject since the Flint water issue surfaced. Simply stated, DWSD has the ability to 
service Flint with water only through the interconnect owned by GCDC. 

GCDC is working diligently to move forward with Flint receiving DWSD water; however, 
GCDC cannot do anything until it has an agreement with DWSD and Flint as to how the DWSD water 
will be transmitted to Flint. Right now, Flint is requesting GCDC to provide DWSD water GN-01 
pursuant to the written agreement between GCDC and Flint. Additionally, Flint has also request DWSD 
to provide Flint with water with the understanding that DWSD has no way to transmit the water to Flint. 
There is no question that Flint wants and eventually will be serviced with DWSD water; however, DWSD 
and Flint cannot continually ignore the fact that GCDC owns and operates the interconnect between 
DWSD and Flint. 

GCDC has been working diligently to assist Flint in receiving DWSD water; however, DWSD to 
date has been unwilling to provide GCDC the information it needs so that Flint may switch over the 
DWSD water. When you have prepared your response, please send it to kkilby@mcgrawmorris.com or 
contact Director John O’Brien at

Re: Increase in average day and maximum peak day by GCDC 

Dear Mr. Wolfson: 

GCDC has received a formal request from Flint to receive DWSD water via GCDC per GCDC’s 
contract with Flint. GCDC’s rates are currently based on 12 mgd average day and 25 mgd maximum 
peak day. Does DWSD have the capacity to increase demand to GCDC to 28.5 mgd average day and 51 
mgd peak day? If so, could you please provide GCDC with the rates for 28.5 mgd average and 51 mgd 
peak day through June 30, 2016? 

As you are aware, time is of the essence. I would respectfully ask that if at all possible you could 
provide answers to the above two (2) questions stated above by 5:00 p.m. today. It is anticipated that if 
DWSD has the capacity and all of the issues between Flint and GCDC are resolved, GCDC anticipates 
providing Treated Water to Flint within the next seven (7) days. 

If you should have any questions or concerns regarding this communication, please feel free to

Subject: RE: request for comment on congressman's letter 


I do not believe we should respond to this over the top letter for both legal and philosophical reasons. Responding to 
this just feeds his narrative. How about we not issue a letter in response? Here's my issues: 


1. First paragraph, top of second page, "...additional steps that need to be taken to remediate the damage done 
to the people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of Flint's 
Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available." AN of these emotionally charged and essentially 
unfounded accusations suggest the state's culpability in levying damages to "the people of Flint". There are 
definitely people in Flint (mostly poor and without many resources but also many other people) struggling with 
an old system, brown water, lead and unsavory health problems that have been put through several months of 
alarm and struggle, but let's try to deal with human beings and not political bombast. Let's identify and solve 
problems. Literally hundreds of state employees have worked night and day to resolve these issues. Are we 
going to blame state employees indiscriminately when our people were simply trying to do their jobs to the best 
of their ability and were unable to anticipate (for whatever reason) ail the consequences? 

2. First bullet point, "...and other state resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair damage 
done...". Sorry, but we're not going to commit the general fund to repair "...Flint's water distribution 
system." What does that mean? And if vve sign on to that then where does it stop and what repairs? 

3. Second paragraph, "...hundreds of millions of dollars of damage....". Where did this come from? I take it the 
Congressman is now a self-appointed expert on water systems and their cost? 

4. Second bullet, "...the state create a fund for ongoing assistance...." We already have several funds to deal with 
lead exposure and we have multiple programs, WIC, Medicaid, health endowment, etc. to assist people in 
need. Why would vve create another fund? 

5. Third paragraph, "...need for significant investments in the local health system in order to respond....". We 
already make significant investments in the local system. They were able to identify the danger early and I 
would assume they will be significant players in the future. Additionally, DHHS has a myriad of programs already 
in place to assist the local health system, which I don't need to remind everyone is a city owned hospital and for 
whatever reason never consulted by the city when the KWA conversion was being studied and proposed. That 
system also never objected nor tested the Flint River before, even though the river was always the city's source 
backup. Even the proposal prior to the state's involvement considered using two million gallons of Flint River 
water and that was a public record. But, that's another issue best left to another time, 

6. Third bullet, "...rescind Flint's obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting.,..". The state gave the 
city $2,1 million to help the water system during the summer, and part of the agreement to get the $6 million 
from the legislature for the emergency was contingent on Flint contributing a share. 


l 



7. Fourth paragraph, "...for the state's failures is an abdication of clear responsibility....". First of all, it's not a 
state's failures, it is a perhaps avoidable mistake made with the corrosives that was unacceptable to us, the 
Director and Governor are taking actions to fix the problems, the health and wellness of the people of Flint is 
our absolute concern, and it's not an abdication of dear responsibility. The "...state-appointed emergency 
manager was in charge..." may well be accurate for the physical change, but the decision to leave the Detroit 
system was made when the city, the Mayor, the council, the county, local leaders and the KWA was devised and 
that was well before the physical change. 

For these reasons and others. I'd prefer Sara's general assistance and aid comments and not responding to the letter.

Governor Rick Snyder 
Executive Office of the Governor 
P.O, Box 30013 
Lansing, Michigan 4S9G9 


Governor Snyder: 

I would like to provide you an update with some of the work we are doing in response to your 
letter on October 2, 201 5 letter. I also have three requests of the state that are necessary to 
provide relief to the victims of the Flint water crisis. 

First, Senator Stabenow, Senator Peters and I wrote a letter to the IDS. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EFA) asking for clarification on whether federal Saw penults states to use Safe Drinking 
Water State Revolving Funds (Revolving Funds) to finance the replacement of privately owned 
lead water service lines (attached). The EPA responded that the Revolving Funds can in fact be 
used for this purpose. My office immediately notified both your office and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality of this fact 

Secondly, the three of us also wrote to Secretary Tom Vilsack requesting that the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide greater clarification on the availability of “Ready to 
Feed” formula for recipients of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (W1C) in Flint, Additionally, the letter asks to identify resources to improve the 
nutrition of Flint residents specifically as it relates to lead, because a certain diet can reduce 
some of the impact of exposure. The USDA is currently reviewing the letter. 

Third, 1 have been working with the EPA on important revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule 
that would prevent a public health crisis like the one in Flint from happening again in other 
communities. I will be providing testimony at a meeting of the National Drinking Water 
Advisory Council next Wednesday, November 18 on what we have learned firsthand in Flint and 
the necessary' improvements to the Lead and Copper Rule. 


1 will continue to pursue all of these avenues in order to find assistance for the people of Flint. 
There are, however, additional steps that need to he taken to remediate the damage done to the 
people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of 
Flint's Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available. I urge state and local partners to 
work in coordination to fulfill the following requests, 

® First 1 request that the state of Michigan use its Revolving Funds and other state 
resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair the damage done to Flint’s 
water distribution system. 

Due to the corrosive nature of the water, conservative estimates show there has been hundreds of 
millions of dollars of damage done to Flint’s water distribution system. The damage to the 
system will increase maintenance costs resulting in higher rates for Flint water users, who 
already are burdened by the highest water rates in the state. Furthermore, the presence of over 
15,000 lead service lines continues to threaten the quali ty of the water and creates the potential 
for future lead exposure through drinking water. As stated previously, the EPA has said that 
using the Revolving Funds for this purpose is allowed under federal law, and I request the state 
do so. 


® Second, I request the state create a fond for ongoing assistance to the people of Flint to 
respond to the impacts of lead exposure. 

Hie effects of lead are serious arid permanent, with especially harmful impacts on young 
children and those with weakened immune systems. In discussions with health professionals, 
they have expressed the need for significant investments in the local health system in order to 
respond to the widespread exposure of lead to the people of Flint including monitoring of future 
lead exposure. This fund should include support for, at a minimum, continuous health 
monitoring, early education programs, nutrition education, support sendees for children to 
succeed in school, and continued exposure prevention efforts. The investments we make now to 
combat the negative impacts of lead exposure will pay dividends in avoided costs In the future, 

® Finally, I again ask that the state immediately reverse course rad rescind Flint’s 
obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting to the Detroit water system 
and refund any money the city of Flint has had to pay. 

Requiring a financially distressed city and its people to pay tor the state’s failures is an 
abdication of dear responsibility'’ by the state. The state-appointed emergency manager was in 
charge of the city of Flint during the time that the decision to leave the Detroit system was made. 
The state ^ not Flint - created this water crisis, and the state needs to pay to fix it. The $2 million 
Flint spent to reconnect to the Detroit water system could be used for many other essential 
services in Flint, such as hiring policemen and firefighters, improving schools rad maintaining 
parks. 



In addition to state investments, I encourage the state to request assistance from federal agencies. 
They have extensive experience working with health, education and nutrition systems nationwide 
and could provide critical resources to state officials. Specifically, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention has offered resources if the state requests it. 1 will work to support any 
efforts for federal assistance the state makes. 

I look forward to working with the state and federal governments to not only provide clean 
drinking water to the people of Flint immediately, but also repair the damage done to the city’s 
water system and give local health professionals the resources they need to combat die long term 
impacts of lead exposure. 


Sincerely, 



Dan Kildce

Section Separator (f) Update to the City of Flint Financial and Operating Plan 


City of Flint Financial and Operating Plan - Fiscal Year 2013 - UPDATE 


Introduction 

This Financial and Operating Plan for the City of Flint is submitted by the Emergency 
Financial Manager for the City of Flint to Governor Rick Snyder, through the Department of 
Treasury for the State of Michigan, in accordance with Public Act 72, Section 141.1220. 

This report includes a summary of the financial conditions, goals for the City of Flint, plans 
to conduct the operations of the city and the planned and on-going actions being taken to 
resolve the financial emergency. This plan will be posted on the city’s website: 
www.cityofflint.com 


Summary of Finaucial Condition of the City of Flint Leading to the Appointment of an 
Emergency Manager 

hi the report to Governor Snyder, dated November 7, 2011, the Flint Financial Review Team 
summarized the findings of the Preliminary Review conducted by the Treasury Department 
(August 29 - September 12, 2011) and then reported the existence of, or likely occurrence of, 
the specific conditions set forth in Section 13(3) of Public Act 4 201 1 which led to the 
recommendation of the appointment of an Emergency Manager. 

Preliminary Review Findings: 

• The City has incurred cumulative deficits in many of its funds over several years. 
The unaudited 2011 cumulative deficit is estimated to be $25.7 million. 

• The deficit elimination plan submitted to the Department of Treasury by city 
officials has not been followed and the general fund deficit has increased and is 
now estimated to be approximately $1 1.0 million. 

• The general fund expenditures have exceeded revenues since 2007. 

• The City relied upon transfers from the water supply and sewage disposal fund for 
general city operations. 

• City officials also borrowed from other funds to compensate for cash shortages 
including the public improvement fund, the local street fund and the self insurance 
fund. 

• The City continued to experience a cash shortage. 

• The City’s ability to pay short term obligations was uncertain. 

• The pension system was less than 60 percent funded. 

• City officials failed to make staff reductions in accordance with the deficit 
elimination plan. 


Flint Financial Review Team Findings: 

• The City has a general fund deficit of $ 14,621 ,546 as of June 30, 2010 which was 
not eliminated within the two year preceding period. 

• The City previously submitted a five year deficit elimination plan for a cumulative 
general fund deficit of $7,046,820 as of June 30, 2008. However, by June 30, 

2010 the cumulative general fund deficit had grown to $14,621,546. An updated 
plan submitted for 2010 does not purport to eliminate the cumulative deficit until 
2030 and that relies upon the issuance of an additional $12 million of debt in 
2013. 

• A structural operating deficit existed in the general fund as of June 30, 2007, 

2008, 2009, 2010 and the general hind is projected to have a $6,768,864 deficit as 
of June 30, 2011. 


Background (Pre-2011) 

Several conditions developed over a period of decades to place the City of Flint in a situation 
of chronic fiscal stress. The major employer, General Motors, significantly reduced 
operations in Flint (in 1978 GM employed over 80,000 people, by 2006 employment totaled 
8,000). The population of the City declined 18 percent between the census of 2000 and 2010. 
Owner occupied housing decreased from a high of 73.1 percent in 1960 to a 2010 low of 44.7 
percent. The jobless rate for the 2010 annual reporting period was 23.2 percent. State Shared 
Revenue which accounts for 31 percent of the General Fund decreased 13 percent over the 
past five years. 

hi addition to the above noted reduced State Shared Revenue, the City’s two other sources of 
revenue, property tax and income tax, have both suffered significant reductions. Between 
2006 and 2011, property tax revenue has decreased 33 percent and income tax revenue has 
decreased 39 percent. 

As revenue decreased, the City of Flint implemented numerous cost controls. The workforce 
has been reduced by 50% since 2001; yet the total cost of wages, benefits, and retiree 
premiums have continued to increase. Note that the liability for sendees already rendered is 
essentially a fixed cost which is now borne by fewer active employees and reduced city 
revenues. 

Note: the statistics quoted above are taken from the report by Brie Scorsone, Ph.D. titled 
“Long-Term Crisis and Systemic Failure: Taking the Fiscal Stress of America’s Older Cities 
Seriously Case Study: City of Flint, Michigan” dated September 2011.

Planning Process 

The City of Flint was determined to be in a financial emergency by the Flint Financial 
Review Team as noted in the above section: Summary of Financial Condition of the City 
of Flint. On November 1, 201 1 Governor Rick Snyder appointed Michael K. Brown as 
Emergency Manager. EM Brown developed a Financial and Operating Plan utilizing the 
resources of a five person Advisory Committee as well as five additional advisory 
committees. The EM sought broad expertise to ensure public engagement and to maintain a 
sense of continuity with the Mayor and the City Council. In fact, all nine Council Members 
and over fifty other citizens participated in the advisory committees. 

The Advisory Committees are: 

o Finance/ Administration — Chair Armando Hernandez, 

■ o Public Safety - Chair Diana Kelly, 

o Infrastructure/D evelopment - Chair George Wilkinson, 
o Grants/DCED - Chair Sue Peters, 
o Pension and OPEB Underfunding - Chair Ed Kurtz. 

The EM’s Financial and Operating Plan was updated in the Emergency Manager’s June 1, 
2012 report to the State Treasurer. 

On August 8, 2012 Edward J. Kurtz was appointed as Emergency Financial Manager. 
Following this, a new Advisory Committee was established and the State Treasurer approved

these individuals to serve on the City of Flint Emergency Financial Manager’s Advisory 
Committee: 

Mayor Dayne Walling Kenyetta Dotson 

Reverend Phillip Thompson Tim Herman 

Since then. Rev. Thompson has asked to step down for personal reasons and Mr. Kurtz has 
asked four others to serve as well: Dan Cady, Armando Hernandez, Adam Thomason and 
Reverend Timothy Stokes. 

The Emergency Financial Manager has utilized the Advisory Team, the City of Flint 
Management Team and the August 8, 2012 update of the Financial and Operating Plan to 
provide this revision to the Financial and Operating Plan for Fiscal Year 2013. 

Management appointments have been made to ensure that the essential services necessary for 
the public’s health, safety and welfare are assured and to continue to conduct all aspects of 
the City of Flint’s operation within the resources available. Any employment contracts were 
extended with the approval of the Treasury Department. 

It is important to point out that early in 2012 under Emergency Manager Michael Brown 
immediate steps were taken to reorganize city government operations including; elimination 
of departments, consolidation of departments, elimination of management level positions, as 
well as adjusting compensation of elected and appointed officials.

All Departments 


Department Management reconfigurations were completed in anticipation of reduced staffing 
levels as provided in the FY(13) Budget. (See Attachment # 1 Organizational Chart) 

Financial/Adm in istration/lT 

Cash Flow FY13 as of December 2012 

Cash flow has improved with the receipt of revenues from the public safety millage, 
street light assessment, and waste collection fees. Pooled cash on hand is in excess of 
$25 million, compared to $13 million as of December, 2011. However, the General 
Fund still relies heavily on borrowed cash as a result of its $19 million accumulated 
deficit. This cannot be resolved without borrowing, as stated in the 201 1 Deficit 
Elimination Plan. 

FY13 Budget Status as of December 2012 

The FY13 budget was balanced without projected deficit spending. As of December 
30, 2012, revenues and expenses are generally on target. The budget was amended in 
December to reflect some adjustments to revenues and expenses, including the 
proceeds of the voter approved millage for police and fire protection, projected 
revenues and expenses for the operation of the City lock-up; and the extension of a 
public safety grant from the Mott Foundation which provides continued funding for 
1 1 law enforcement officers as well as 9 Neighborhood Safety Officers. 

Income tax revenues appear a little soft, and continue to be monitored, and 
discussions are underway to address significant over expenditures in Fire Department 
overtime. 

Revenues and expenses in the water and sewer funds appear to be on target. 

Monitoring grant expenditures and receipts continues to be problematic, but is 
improving. 

Development of a budget which moves the City toward financial stability was 
accomplished with the FY13 budget. FY13 began July 1, 2012. 

The process of implementing the FY13 budget is continuing. It is balanced 
realistically, and encompasses significant revenue increases and expenditure 
reductions. The process started with a projected gap of $25 million between projected 
revenues and projected expenses. The result was a total budget of $192 million, of 
which $82 million is sewer and water; $58 million is General Fund and $30 million is 
federal CDBG. 

The budget encompassed expenditure reductions which included the elimination of 
nearly 150 positions (20% of the workforce); employee concessions including a 


Final 2/7/2013 


Page 


6 


restructuring of health and pension benefits and employee costs; and various 
organizational changes. 

On July 1, new health care plans for active employees was put in place, as well 
changes in pension benefits. Health care plans for retirees began on August 1, 2012 
for pre-65 retirees; this was followed with changes for Medicare-eligible retirees on 
September 1, 2012. The City has been sued in Federal District Court, but no 
decisions have resulted to date. If the City is precluded from implementing these 
changes in health care for retirees, there will be a projected (unbudgeted) increase in 
expenses of $3.5 million hi FY13. 

For future employees, city retiree health care will no longer be an option, and the 
traditional defined benefit pension plan for non-police and fire employees will be 
replaced with a hybrid pension plan. There are also numerous changes which increase 
management flexibility and reduce other employee costs. 

The budget also implements new revenues in order to provide the level of revenues 
still needed - in spite of expense reductions - to continue the marginal level of city 
funded public safety personnel and basic city seivices. These revenues include 
numerous fee increases; a $143 annual fee for waste collection (replacing a dedicated 
3 mill tax levy); a $62 special assessment fee for operation, maintenance, and 
improvement of street lights (in the past this was a $2.85 million general fund 
expense); and an overall 25% increase in water and sewer rates (12.5% water; 45% 
sewer). Unfortunately, the reliance on fees and assessments will create hardship for 
many of the City’s residents. However, the choices for increasing revenues at this 
time were limited. 

If the budget can be implemented as planned, a significant objective - not spending 
more than the City takes in - will be accomplished, and will have done this while 
avoiding public safety reductions. 

However, the City faces several legal challenges. While the challenges may not be 
sustained in the long term, any impediments to implementing the budget will have 
severe financial impacts. 

For example, legal challenges which prohibit the City from implementing revenue 
increases or expenditure decreases will require immediate actions to further reduce 
spending - including public safety - and may impact the City’s ability to function at 
an adequate level, particularly in light of the marginal cash flow. 

Potential challenges the City may face from budgetary perspective include ones 
associated with the numerous rate increases incorporated into the budget, changes in 
retiree health care, and the unilateral implementation of changes to three collective 
bargaining agreements. It should be noted that through the Emergency Manager the 


Final 2/7/2013 


Page

City of Flint was able to reach tentative agreements with three of the six bargaining 
units. To this point, the City was recently sued over the implementation of increased 
water and sewer rates, by the President of the City Council et al. This is a prime 
example of litigation that could impede the COF’s ability to maintain fiscal solvency. 
With regard to the water and sewer rate lawsuit brought by the President of the City 
Council et al, the City filed a motion to dismiss this suit and a decision is expected in 
early February 2013. 

Audit 2012 

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for FY12 was completed and 
has been filed with the state in a timely manner. The results were as expected, with 
fewer auditor comments than in past years. Deficits exist in the General Fund ($19.1 
million) and in the Water Fund ($8.8 million). 

In the FY 13 budget document, prepared in April, 2012, the accumulated deficit for 
the FY12 General Fund was projected to be $18.1 million. However, this projection 
did not include the $1 .54 million write down for the value of Genesee Towers. 

Adding the write down to the projected deficit of $18.1 million would have resulted 
in a total of $19.7 million. 

In the FY12 CAFR, the amended budget projected a deficit of $16.3 million. 

However, this projection did not include the $1.54 million write down for Genesee 
Towers. It also included $739,406 in federal grant revenues and $602,192 in local 
revenues which did not materialize. Taking these items into consideration, the deficit 
projection would have been $19,2 million. 

The $19.1 million accumulated deficit reflected an excess of expenditures in the 
General Fund for FY12 of $ 1 1 . 1 million. This was anticipated by the Emergency 
Manager shortly after being appointed, which was almost six months into the FY12 
year. Given that FY12 was nearly half over, and that significant unplanned reductions 
in sendees, primarily public safety, would need to occur if the projected deficit were 
to be immediately eliminated, the decision of the Emergency Manager, in consultation 
with Treasury, was to contain costs as much as possible but without significantly 
reducing services - especially public safety - for the balance of the year. Instead, focus 
was concentrated on developing a budget for FY13 which would move towards 
restoring Flint to long term financial solvency. It was projected that as a result of this 
decision, the deficit for FY12 could be as much as $12 million, resulting in an 
accumulated deficit of $20 million. 

The deficits identified in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 
FY 1 2, the year ended June 30, 20 1 2, are follows: 

General Fund - $ 19,184,850 

Water Supply Division - $ 8,758,091 

Economic Development Corporation $ 119,439

Financing the Deficits 

In April 2012 the Emergency Manager filed a 201 1 Deficit Elimination Plan focused 
on the accumulated deficit as of June 30, 201 1 . That plan indicated the City’s intent to 
request authorization to borrow approximately $9 million in Fiscal Stabilization 
Bonds in order to address the accumulated General Fund deficit once a credible FY13 
budget was in place. The 2011 Deficit Elimination Plan was approved by the State. 

On May 24, 2012 the City filed an application for borrowing with the State 
Administrative Board, and the Department of Treasury has issued a memorandum 
stating that the request satisfies the necessary statutory requirements. At this time. 
Treasury has not authorized the borrowing as proposed in the 2011 Deficit 
Elimination Plan. 

While this borrowing request addresses the accumulated FY1 1 deficit, there was an 
additional deficit at the end of FY12. It is estimated at this time that an additional $10 
million will need to be financed in order to address the FY12 deficit. However, if the 
FY13 budget is implemented as it was adopted, there should be no additional General 
Fund deficit. There will be ongoing deficits in the water and sewer funds, but only as 
related to unfunded OPEB liabilities. 

The City is currently working on a 2012 Deficit Elimination Plan. A Deficit 
Elimination Plan addressing the accumulated $19.1 million deficit in the General 
Fund and the $8.8 million deficit in the Water Fund will be filed shortly. The plan for 
the General Fund will be as outlined hi the 2011 Deficit Elimination Plan. While it is 
simply not possible to eliminate this deficit without bonding, it is the preference of 
the Emergency Manager that any “one time” revenues should be applied directly to 
the deficit. 

The FY13 budget anticipated initial debt sendee for the FY12 accumulated deficit, 
and appropriate amounts will be set aside in the FY14 budget. 

The deficit in the Water Fund is less than the unfunded OPEB liability, and since the 
City is not financially able to begin funding its OPEB liabilities overall, there is no 
reason to raise water rates to cover this amount. 

hi addition, the City’s approach to containing its OPEB liabilities has been to 
restructure its active and retiree health care benefits, and to eliminate the promise of 
retiree health care for new employees. The changes have had a significant impact on 
the City’s OPEB liabilities, reducing the total unfunded liability from nearly $900 
million to less than $400 million, and reducing the Annual Required Contribution 
(ARC) from $60 million to $22 million. 

Labor Agreements 

During the tenure of EM Michael Brown, Labor Counsel held meet and confer 
sessions with the City’s six bargaining units. A target of 20% equivalent wage 


Final 2/7/2013 


Page 


9 



reductions was achieved. Tentative Agreements were reached with four of these 
bargaining units. As contract settlement was necessary prior to adopting the FY13 
budget, the EM invoked the 19K provision in Public Act 4 from the State Treasurer 
for the bargaining units which had not achieved Tentative Agreements (EM Orders 1 8 
and 26) and with Local 1799 which had approved a TA but had not ratified (EM 
Order 27). 

EFM Edward Kurtz has held additional sessions with AFSME, Flint Police Officers 
Association (FPOA) and the Firefighters Union. In January 2013 AFSME and the 
City reached agreement for the privatizing of waste collection and demolition. FPOA 
has notified the City that they have files a lawsuit to return to arbitration. FPOA is 
asking for a return to the status quo (prior to EM imposed contract). The Firefighters 
Union and the City are working on overtime containment. 

Economic Vitality Incentive Program (EViP) Requirements and Activities 
The City of Flint has met all reporting requirement dates for Economic Vitality 
Incentive Program (EVIP) in order to qualify for all disbursements of State Shared 
Revenue. Each report is available on the City’s website nwnv.citvofflint.com through 
Munetrix Citizens Guide to Finances and Dashboard. 

The City contracted with Plante Moran to conduct a study to evaluate the potential of 
shared services between the City and Genesee County treasury functions. This study 
has been funded by the Mott Foundation, 

Income tax processing is being handled through a joint project with the Cities of 
Grand Rapids and Lansing. 

The Treasury Department has also created the Competative Grant Assistance Program 
(C-GAP) as a means of encouraging shared services implementation. The City of 
Flint participated in five C-GAP applications which included Human Resource Hiring 
and Management system sharing with the Genesee Intermediate School District and 
Genesee County; a fiber optic cable expansion also with Genesee Intermediate School 
District and Genesee County; Criminal Justice system and Courts Electronic 
Workflow Initiative with Genesee County, City of Flushing and plans for expansion 
throughout Genesee County; a Genesee County Regional Purchasing Collaborative 
with Genesee Intermediate School District and Genesee County; and a proposal to 
expand and strengthen the 9-1-1 communication tower system with the City and the 
Genesee County 9-1-1 Consortium. 

Transition of Flint Employee Retirement System (FERS) to Michigan Employees 
Retirement System fMERSj 

The FERS to MERS transition nears completion. Retirees have been receiving their 
monthly checks from MERS since October 18 2012. Final data transfers are expected 
to be completed in February 2013.

Prescription Drug Program 

City of Flint has suspended the planned implementation of a modified prescription 
drag program which requires the issuance of a generic drug unless a name brand drug 
is determined to be medically necessary. This action resulted due to a lawsuit, Yurk 
et ai. v, City of Flint, pending in Genesee County Circuit Court before Hon. Archie 
Hayman. Judge Hayman granted a temporary restraining order and has completed a 
hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. However, the court took the 
motion under advisement and has not issued a decision. 

Dependent Eligibility Audit 

The Risk Management Office has completed the process of conducting a dependent 
eligibility audit Three hundred eighty-one dependents were identified for removal 
from the City’s health plans. This reduction is estimated to save $1.3 million in the 
first year. 

Administrative Reorganizations 

The City of Flint Human Relations Commission (HRC) has been reorganized to 
address constituent and citizen services. This reorganization was developed in relation 
to elimination of departments (Ombudsman and Civil Service Commission), as well 
as reductions in executive staff. The HRC will now be the First Stop Office at City 
Hall with a focus on prompt citizen response. 

Prior to the start of FY13 the Information Services Department eliminated all but two 
of the existing positions. Through reorganization, 6 of 9 employees were rehired 
under new job descriptions. The new structure allowed more flexibility and greater 
utilization of personnel. Several large scale projects are nearing completion including: 
installation of a back-up server for Public Safety and 911, installation of new 
switches which will allow for a more complete use of Public Safety’s data collection 
and record keeping systems. Other projects are on track, primarily the system upgrade 
of the BS&A ERP. Several legacy projects are nearing final milestones: installation 
of a new visualization server cluster, installation of 300 new desktop terminals and a 
cost savings pump station automation project. 

Infrastructure/Development 

Waste Collection 

hi early February 2013, the Infrastructure Department signed a contract with a private 
waste collection company. The City of Flint will no longer collect or dispose of 
household waste. It is expected that the fee for waste collection sendee will continue 
to be billed and collected by the City. 

Water Issues 

The City has been working closely with the Department of Treasury to come to a final 
decision on the long term source of water for the City of Flint. The final two choices 


Final 2/7/2013 


Page 


11 


are between signing a 30 year conforming contract with the Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department (DWSD) or joining the regional Karegnondi Water Authority. 

A final decision is expected in February 2013. 

U. S. Department of Environmental Quality S2 Grant 

An S2 DEQ grant to study infrastructure condition for water pollution control was 
accepted. The study was defined to encompass the City’s entire sanitary sewer system 
including the overall collection system, the capacity and condition of the system, 
potential upgrade recommendations to the lift stations and the pumping stations, and 
to make recommendations for necessary investments to maintain the system. 

U.S. Department of Energy Grant 

The Department of Energy notified the City of Flint in November 2012 that the 
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) lias expired. The 
expiration of the grant resolves the necessity to continue any negotiations related to 
the grant at this time. The expiration did not constitute a termination for cause or 
involve any other adverse finding. 

Golf Courses 

Three of the city’s four golf courses were leased to private organizations. Two 
courses were operational summer 2012 and three are expected to be open during the 
summer of 201 3. 

Senior Centers 

The Pierce Senior Center closed oil April 30, 2012 as funding was no longer 
available. The City of Flint continues to explore our options with the two open Senior 
Centers, as RFP's were issued in the fall of 2012. Talks continue with potential 
vendors as well as the County Officials for the future of these Centers. A time frame 
of May is the goal for a new vendor to take over the day-to-day operations at both 
Brennan Center and Hasselbring Center. 

Smith Village Development 

The Smith Village housing project is funded primarily with HUD and NSP2 grants. 
Phase I, which includes 30 housing units, has been completed as scheduled. HUD has 
determined February 10, 2012 was the goal to expend 50% of the allocation. The 
Smith Village housing project has met that development goal. 

On May 18, 2012, the City announced that Phase II of the Smith Village development 
will be undertaken by Ginosko Development Company and Rohde Construction 
Company. Ginosko’s site plan was approved by the Flint Planning Commission on 
May 22, 2012. 

Smith Village Phase II is scheduled to complete 25 homes by February 28, 2013. 

The developer is on-track to meet that deadline. Nine homes built by the new 


Final 2/7/2013 


Page

developer will be completed by March 30, 2013. 21 Occupancy Permits have been 
received for homes in Phase I. Ten of the completed homes have purchase 
agreements and five mortgage closing are schedule to take place by February 28th, 

In the Spring the contractor will complete three more homes which will bring the 
total completed to 42. As sale proceeds become available, up to an additional 5 units 
can be built. 

Master Plan 

The City of Flint continues to make progress on the preparation of its first 
comprehensive Master Plan in fifty years through a $1.5 million HUD Community 
Challenge Planning Grant. As a result of this grant, a Chief Planning Officer and two 
Associate Planners have been hired. These staff members coordinate monthly 
Steering Committee meetings and convene an additional six resident-led advisory 
groups containing up to 162 individuals to discuss the Master Plan with Flint 
residents. In total, staff has attended or held seventy-one community meetings, 
reaching approximately 1,850 community stakeholders. A website, 
www. imagineflint, com, and a Facebookpage, City of Flint Master Plan has been 
established to inform citizens about the planning process and to gather input. 

Staff was able to secure grant funds from the C.S. Mott Foundation in the amount of 
$263,804, and the Ruth Mott Foundation in the amount of $50,000. The City also 
applied for and received a grant in the amount of $13,500 from the Community 
Foundation of Greater Flint for the preparation of a comprehensive report on 
integrating local food systems into the Master Plan. A draft report on Local Food was 
completed in December and will be used to educate the public on this issue. 

Planning staff collaborated with the Community Foundation of Greater Flint to 
provide $500 mini-grants to neighborhood groups in low-income areas that complete 
a housing conditions inventory. Tailoring a training from Data Driven Detroit, staff 
trained 28 neighborhood groups to conduct this inventory covering approximately 
60% of the City. As a result, the City was able to complete an updated Housing 
Conditions Map of the entire City. This data is already being used to better target 
demolition resources. In fact, staff recently worked with the Genesee County Land 
Bank, Genesee County Metropolitan Planning Commission, and Flint Community 
Schools to develop a proposal for $5 million to demolish the City’s and County’s 
most blighted properties through the Michigan Blight Elimination Grant Program. 

From April through December 2012, staff undertook the task of data collection, 
culminating in an interim Existing Conditions Report. This report contains both 
quantitative demographic and economic data and qualitative data gathered through 
community workshops reaching approximately 700 individuals including an 
additional twenty-one key in-person interviews. The Existing Conditions Report was 
unveiled to the Steering Committee at the January 15’ 2013 meeting and has been 
posted to the project website. This Existing Conditions Report will be used to frame 


Final 2/7/2013

the large Vision and Goals Workshop planned for March 9, 2013, which will involve 
between 300 and 500 stakeholders in developing our Master Plan framework using 
the consensus building approach of America Speaks. 

The city is pursuing an aggressive schedule of document development with the goal to 
present a draft version of the master plan to the city planning commission for 
consideration by Fall 201 3. 

U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Monitoring 

After the February 2012 HUD Monitoring of the HOME Program, The City of Flint 

received notice from HUD that it has capacity to run the HOME program. 

In the City of Flint 2012 Single Audit, DCED will have one finding related to the 
resolution of the OIG audit for 2010. In the 201 1 Single Audit, under the previous 
administration, there were 8 findings. 

hi September 2012, HUD headquarters in Washington D.C. monitored the DCED 
ARRA Homeless Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program and stated that the City 
of Flint established a comprehensive and well coordinated program for providing 
homelessness prevention assistance for its residents and that the City's HPRP Policies 
and Procedures Manual was well thought out. 

hi December 2012, HUD notified the City of Flint, in its Comprehensive Annual 
Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) that it met its timeliness ratio and 
expenditure requirement reaffirming their confidence in DCED's capacity to 
administer federal programs. 

Real Estate Transactions 

hi August 2012 the City of Flint sold the Genesee Towers to Uptown Redevelopment 
Corporation for $1 and committed $750,000 CDBG dollars toward the over $4 
million cost of demolition. Genesee Towers has been a liability for the City since 
December 2010 when the city assessed a one time millage to cover the $9.0 million 
judgment. This transaction has not yet been finalized due to title issues. 

A quit claim deed for Chevy-in-the-Hole site has been transacted between the EDC 
and the City of Flint. EPA money for clean up has been agreed upon. 

Facilities 

An private company held an on-line auction in January 2013 to dispose of surplus 
equipment from a variety of departments in the City. This one day auction netted 
$1 30,000. Future auctions of surplus equipment will be held in a similar maimer.

A Police and Fire Protection Millage request for 6 mils for 5 years was placed on the 
November ballot and was approved by the electorate. This will begin the process of 
stabilizing both the Police and Fire Departments. The City is currently in the process of 
interviewing to hire ten new police officers. 

A Public Safety Plan was introduced to the public on May 4, 20 1 2. This plan addresses 
Police and Fire department organizational plan, operation of the lock-up, transition to 800 
MHz communications system and the formation of the Criminal Justice System Advisory 
Council. 

In June 2012 the Police Department changed to a 12 hour shift operation within a four 
District Patrol plan. These changes, in combination with the expansion of alternative call 
response procedures (including the introduction of the on-line CopLogic reporting system), 
have resulted in the continuing reduction in response times to 91 1 calls. 

The City completed change over to the 800 MHz communication system for Police and Fire 
Departments before the December 31, 2012 required implementation date. The installation 
of a point to point microwave link with the Genesee County 9-1-1 Consortium tower system 
is yet to be completed. 

The Public Safety Department recommended selection of the Genesee County Sheriff as the 
operator of the Flint lock-up. The lock-up opened the week of October 1, 2012. A number of 
policy issues arose and have been resolved. In just December 2012, 679 individuals were 
lodged in the lock-up. 

Based on input from the State Police, Governor’s Office and a Michigan State University 
Criminal Justice Study, it is clear that the Genesee County Criminal Justice System and the 
Flint Police Department could benefit from improved coordination and policy development. 

In September 2012 the first meeting of the Criminal Justice System Advisoiy Council 
(CJSAC) was held. Eight workgroups were established. Through these work groups a 
number of cooperative projects, streamlined operations and new collaborations have been 
identified; these were reported at the second CJSAC meeting in January 2013. A Treasury 
Department C-GAP application was originated aid submitted through this process. 


In June 2012, the City received a 6 month giant renewal from the C. S. Mott Foundation for 
the Community Policing grant which has funded 10 officers and 1 sergeant. The giant also 
includes other criminal justice system personnel support, including the addition of 
Neighborhood Safety Officers who would be responsible for enforcement of blight violations, 
vehicle ticketing for impound and other neighborhood duties. This grant was submitted in 
conjunction with the Michigan State University School of Criminal Justice Training and 
Assistance team. The MSU team will assist the City in implementing several phases of the

Public Safety plan. In December 2012, the Mott Foundation extended this grant for an 
additional 6 months which will provide funding through the end of the FY13 budget, 

The City of Flint is continuing its existing collaborative efforts with regional partners. 
Examples: Flint Area Narcotics Unit, Safe Streets Task Force, and U.S. Attorney’s Office 
Zero Tolerance gun violence reduction initiative, LifeLines (formerly known as CeaseFire), 
and other programs to help eliminate gang activity and prevent other violent acts, 

A protocol was finalized for the transition to the Genesee County Sheriffs Department to 
handle the paramedic calls in the City of Flint. This millage is now being managed only by 
Genesee County. Completion date was July 1, 2012. 

The FEMA funded SAFER Grant which supports the wages and benefits of 39 firefighters 
was renewed on June 10, 2012 for two years. The new grant totaled $6.9 million. It is very 
rare that a city would be awarded a full funding request in back-to-back granting periods. 


Projects in Progress 

The Emergency Financial Manager has determined that the projects noted in the following 
list are the top priorities: 

1 . KWA Decision February 1 

2. Waste Collection Operation - complete transition to private firm March 1 

3. Complete Demolition Plan/Contracts for 600 properties February 8 

4. Complete construction at Smith Village September 

5. Contract/Commit all HUD funds (DCED, NSP2 and 3) September 30 

6. 911 merger study April 

7. SBI decision March 


8. Begin FY14 Budget Process 
Financial/ Administration/IT 


mid-February 


The budget process for FY14 has begun. Each department has been required to develop 
detailed organizational charts, goals, objectives and performance measures which will be an 
essential step in planning a five year budget. The five year budget will be a framework for 
long term planning.

The city will continue to review all departments and services for potential merger, 
consolidation, contracted service, shared services with other governmental entities, 
privatization or elimination. As a result of this review determine if these functions should be 
subsidized with general property tax dollars, what will be paid by the users and what services 
can be eliminated. 

Continued reduction in personnel has strained the capability of departments to complete 
compliance and reporting work. Both short and long term vacancies create knowledge 
deficits which are becoming most difficult to overcome. This will be exacerbated as further 
staff reductions are required. 

Cash flow, which was identified ill the audit as an area of ongoing concern, has been 
reviewed. The situation continues to be monitored to assure sufficient cash to pay for current 
expenses, and options for long term solutions will be developed. 

The water and sewer rate increases appear to have been nearly sufficient (within $700,000) to 
cover current operations in the Water Fund, exclusive of OPEB liabilities. Future rate 
increases are probable. The decision on water sourcing - DWSD vs KWA - is of significant 
importance. 

The Finance Department is also proceeding with the following projects: 

• implementation of a Procurement Card system and the associated changes to 
the City’s Purchasing Policies, 

• completion of the update of the pension arid OPEB liabilities, 

• continued aggressive monitoring of revenue and expense activities as 
compared to the FY13 budget, with particular emphasis on revenue 
collections, position counts and overtime expenditures, 

• planning and implementation of employee development programs focusing on 

financial management, supervision and labor relations, and leadership 
development. 1 

Review the process for all grants to the City of Flint for appropriate use of funds, potential 
for continued funding, and timely reapplication. 

Risk Management Office is reviewing various Employee/Retiree health care options 
including plan design, delivery systems, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Wrap Around, 
benefit carve-outs, etc. in an effort to control health care costs 

The City Attorney is continuing with efforts to improve litigation management through claim 
evaluation, claim reporting, attorney training and trial preparation. The City Attorney 
continues to emphasize the “litigation team” approach to case handling, with weekly review 
of pending matters and discussion of how best to protect the City of Flint’s legal interests. 1

The City currently funds the operation of the 68th District Court; in FY13 this amounts to 
$5.4 Million - which comprises 9.2% of the General Fund Budget. The percentage of 
General Fund expense allocated to District Corat has increased about 1.2% as compared to 
five years ago. It is anticipated that this percentage will again increase .5% for FY14. (This is 
a very rough estimate). This significant portion of the City’s General Fund needs to be 
studied closely and recommendations developed to meet this required activity while 
containing and reducing costs. The EFM strongly encourages the State to continue the 
process of working to consolidate the 67 th and 68 th District Courts. 

hifrastructure/Development 

Water and Sewer Services 

As part of the current budget process an evaluation is being made of what efforts can 
be employed to create an effective Preventive Maintenance plan which focuses on 
controlling water loss (leakage). This is expected to involve a combination of 
outsourcing, in-house work, and shared services with the County. 

Discussions have begun with the Genesee County Drain Commissioner on a wide 
range of shared services and partnerships for both water and sewer operations. 

The automation of one of the City’s pump stations (which is currently staffed 24 hrs a 
day) has ail expected completion date of June 2013. This will result in the elimination 
of overtime and a savings of over $500,000 annually. 

The planned shutdown of the City’s incinerator has begun with engineering plans for 
a new load-out facility and is expected to reach completion in approximately 8 
months. The estimated savings is $400,000 annually. 

A new storm water ordinance that shifts the cost allocation to the larger users is in 
process of being developed. 

Transportation 

Discussions have started with the County Road Commissioner on possible shared 
services. 

Both road paving and engineering are seasonal activities and these are at ever 
decreasing levels. These are under review as areas to downsize or eliminate. 
Consideration is being given to developing sendee sharing arrangements or creating 
the ability to source on an as needed basis. 

Outsourcing of Sanitation is now complete and the process of establishing city 
composting is underway with a permit application to DEQ submitted and a site plan 
of action being prepared for the EPA.

Parks and Recreation and Facilities 

The City has identified at least one vendor who has shown the capacity to mow all of 
the city parks (64) multiple times at a rate that fits the current millage. An RFP is 
being issued for procurement in mid-February, 

All city owned facilities are under review for energy savings, revenue generation from 
tenants, or possible liquidation. 

■ Department of Community and Economic Development 

With the end of the Federal NSP program in sight, the City has begun evaluating the 
management needs of the department and what can be outsourced or become a shared 
sendee. This evaluation should be complete and in place by the beginning of fiscal 
year 2014. 

The Emergency Financial Manager has challenged each department to complete the 
use of HUD, CDBG and/or other grant funds within the grant guideline spending 
period. 

Collaborative economic development efforts are underway with the Genesee Regional 
Chamber of Commerce to attract and retain businesses; and to receive and apply new 
tools such as the Next Michigan Development Corporation and Smart Zone 
designation. The city will continue to work with RACER Trust for brownfield 
development, including Buick City. 

The City of Flint is challenged in its current financial condition to provide significant 
investment into job creation and Economic Development. However, the City has 
developed a unique and effective partnership with the Genesee Regional Chamber of 
Commerce (GRCC) which is the recognized economic development entity for 
Genesee County. The City receives specific community and economic development 
services from GRCC each year. 

Public Safety 

Continue to receive patrol assistance and detective assistance from Michigan State Police. 
Patrol assistance is a crime deterrent and increases traffic safety compliance. The detective 
assistance has increased the capacity for investigations within the Flint Police Department. 

Continue existing collaborative efforts with regional partners. Examples: Flint Area 
Narcotics Unit, Safe Streets Task Force, and U.S. Attorney’s Office Zero Tolerance gun 
violence reduction initiative, CeaseFire, and other programs to help eliminate gang activity 
and prevent other violent acts. 

Apply new technologies and information systems to improve police efficiencies and improve 
targeting and effectiveness including New World, CopLogic, Shotspotter and DDACTS.

The Public Safety Administrator resigned from the City of Flint in January 2013. As the 
effectiveness of this position was reviewed the City has decided to pursue installing a full 
time Fire Chief and seek a Police administrator to complete projects associated with the 
Public Safety plan. 

Restructure Fire Department, 911 and emergency response operations to adjust to eliminated 
Federal and County revenue sources. Review options for shared services, station 
configurations, staffing levels, contract services and technology applications. 

All Departments 

Review all city owned assets (both real property and capital equipment) and determine if 
disposal should be pursued. 

Review necessary ordinance and charter revisions which would increase flexibility for 
department reorganization and budget flexibility. 

Investigate appropriate investments necessary to achieve longer term savings, cost avoidance, 
and improved efficiencies. 

The EFM is addressing the financial crisis and also working on meeting the many other needs 
of residents and continuing development of the city. Numerous grant applications have been 
submitted to implement a wide range of programs. 

Grants submitted: 

• Joint application with the Genesee County Landbank for $5 million for demolition. 

• Application to Environmental Protection Agency for nearshore health and lion point 
source pollution, watershed remediation for “Chevy-in-the-Hole” stonnwater 
wetlands. $600,000 

• Application to the Administration for Children and Families for Community 
Economic Development (CED) projects. $800,000 

• The City of Flint is also a partner applicant in the Building Neighborhood Capacity 
Program (Wards 1 & 3) and Promise Neighborhood (Wards 1 & 2) which are part of 
the Federal Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative. ($225,000) 

• The City of Flint and the Flint Farmer’s Market have applied for an Urban Fanner’s 
Market Program which provides funds to entitlement communities, in this application 
the request is for equipment and fees for the SNAP and Double UP Food Bucks. 
($21,742) 


Next Steps 

• Implement department reorganizations, contract agreements, proposed shared 
services, mergers and consolidations. 

# Manage FY1 3 budget compliance.

• Maintain the safety of the residents of the city during this transition and keep the 
citizenry informed, of plans throughout this process. 

• Make and implement key decisions on Infrastructure - particularly water and 
sewer operations. 

• Develop a plan to increase revenue: income tax and other. Include potential for 
urban homesteading. 

• Decide timing and leadership for Charter revision. 


Conclusions 

Significant work has been accomplished to stabilize the financial situation of the City of 
Flint. The whole of the organization is being restructured to reflect a smaller, leaner 
government operation. Services which were routinely provided are being inspected to 
determine if they should continue and if so, in what format. Technology solutions are often 
implemented to increase efficiencies but these also result in reduced opportunities to speak to 
a real person. 

However, the Emergency Financial Manager acknowledges an on-going financial crisis. 

Also, the City of Flint realizes that it is a high priority to address the tremendous public safety 
issues through the improved coordination throughout the criminal justice system in Genesee 
County. Aggressive efforts are being undertaken to clarify and resolve all issues presented in 
this report. 

The City is also approaching the point of diminishing returns. There are only so many 
personnel reductions which can be made before there is no one left to manage the operation. 
We are approaching the limit of the City’s borrowing capability. Capital improvement funds 
are drained. 

Additionally, stable revenue is necessary in order for this city, and most other cities in 
Michigan, to continue to avoid a bankruptcy situation. We have asked our residents to accept 
a significant 6 mil Police and Fire Protection Millage and they have done so. We have 
imposed a street lighting assessment, a waste collection fee and tremendous water and sewer 
rate increases. Our residents have not enjoyed increasing services, increasing property 
valuations or increasing employment opportunities. 

hi the meantime, Flint is still struggling with effects from increased expenses and reduced 
revenue from decisions outside our control. These include: yet another General 
Motors/Delphi closure impacting over 300 jobs, the unknown impact from the changes in 
personal property taxes, the $120,000 cost to hold the State Senate primary election, and the 
$575,000 required match for MDOT projects in FY14. 

We need to hear a state-wide strategy to support Michigan’s cities.

To: Governor Rick Snyder, Treasurer Andrew Dillon 
From: Michael K. Brown, Emergency Manager, City of Flint 
Subject: CLOSING MEMORANDUM 


It has been a pleasure for me to serve the citizens of Flint for the past twenty-two months and I 
thank you for the opportunity to serve as Emergency Manager. 

I have worked hard to begin a cultural change to both improve the approach to city government's 
interaction with citizens and to encourage a wider range of citizen participation. It is important to 
me that the next generation of leaders (I have called them emerging leaders) not be from the 
same mold as the old leaders and have the opportunity to assume positions of responsibility as 
we set a path to the future for Flint. A significant number of my leadership team is comprised of 
Flint residents who are committed to the future of their city. While this approach has meant that 
some things may have taken longer to achieve than it might otherwise take, it has been with the 
realization that changing the culture of City Hall is imperative if history is not to repeat itself. 

I have also tried to champion citizen participation throughout my tenure as Emergency Manager. 
Collectively, hundreds of people have been involved: in the Advisory Teams for Public Safety, 
Infrastructure, Financial, and Legacy issues which I established in January 2012; in the nine ward 
public meetings held in February-March 2012; in the Police and Fire Protection millage campaign 
in Fall 2012; and in the Master Planning process which has involved citizen participation in 
numerous meetings held throughout the City over the past year. I have attached a list of some of 
these individuals who have worked on my advisory groups and the millage team . 

As our regularly submitted reports to the Department of Treasury have documented, we have 
made substantial progress in putting the city on a path to solvency and resolving the financial 
emergency. Many achievements are detailed in the latest Financial and Operating Report which 
was submitted to the Department of Treasury on June 30, 2013. Significant achievements over 
the past twenty-two months include: 


A. Financial 

1 . Developing, adopting and operating with a balanced budget for FY13 - the 
first time in seven years that the City of Flint has lived within a balanced 
budget. 

2. Significantly improving the City’s cash flow - More than $40 million in cash on 
hand as of September 2, 2013 is significantly better than the approximate 

$1 0 million on hand in December 2011. The $10 million in cash at that time 
was due primarily to an $8 million loan from the state in the form of Fiscal 
Stabilization Bonds. 

3. Significantly reducing Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) liabilities by 
more than $500 million - a 60% reduction. Not only have we significantly 
reduced legacy costs by more than 60%, we also have a plan for further 
reducing legacy costs, as detailed in recent presentations to the Department 
of Treasury 



4. Significantly reducing pension administration costs and improving investment 
returns by moving administration of the City’s pension fund to the Municipal 
Employees Retirement Fund, while also changing the structure of future 
pension benefits which will reduce future pension liabilities 

5. Developing a plan for and implementing a reduction in the City's $19.1 million 
deficit ahead of schedule . At the end of FY12, we presented a plan to the 
State Treasurer for eliminating the $19.1 million deficit within 5 years. Based 
on preliminary year end results for FY1 3, we are ahead of the scheduled 
reduction since it appears that FY 1 3 will end with a surplus of revenues over 
expenses by approximately $3 million. This will likely reduce the $19.1 million 
deficit to the $16 million range. Had the Department of Treasury authorized 
the borrowing of $12 million as contained in the approved FY12 Deficit 
Elimination Plan, the remaining deficit would now be closer to $4 million. 

6. Developing a five year financial projection which maps out the continuing 
financial challenges Flint will face, regardless of who is in charge. With FY 14 
balanced and adopted, development of the FY15 budget- which will without 
doubt be the most challenging of the next few years - is underway. In the 
process of developing the multi-year projection, it has also become clear that 
the path for Flint's financial solvency will require additional sources of 
revenue in addition to further reductions in legacy costs. We have identified a 
path for further reductions in legacy costs, and we have also identified an 
increase in the local income tax as the most promising and realistic source of 
new revenue. Unfortunately the Treasurer has not supported that initiative. 

7. Stabilizing Police and Fire Protection revenue . Since being appointed in 

201 1 , it has been clear that.the stabilization and enhancement of public 
safety is the top priority in the City of Flint. Many steps have been taken to 
achieve this, including securing voter approval of a‘6 mill property tax 
increase by a margin of 57% to 43%. Additionally, by ordinance the City must 
now appropriate no less than 55.5% of General Fund revenues for Police 
and Fire budgets. The FY 14 budget dedicates more than 60% of General 
Fund revenues to these purposes, and exceeds 80% when 9-1-1 and District 
Court funding is included. As a result, staffing for police and fire personnel 
was maintained at current levels in spite of the significant staffing reductions 
necessary to balance both the FY1 3 and FY14 budgets. Unfortunately, 
without a new source of revenue in FY15, it is unlikely that can continue. 

8. Resolving Federal Government liabilities - More than $7 million in questioned 
grant costs prior to the EM’s appointment in December 201 1 have been 
resolved - as documented by the OIG report and HUD findings. 

9. Reorganizing City operations - The City workforce has been reduced by 
more than 25% as the City has faced its financial challenges. Doing so while 
still providing for the delivery of city services has required restructuring work 
processes and organizational alignments, as well as the increased use of 
technology. These changes have been made in the context of a newly 
developed strategic plan which identifies the key functions and objectives of 
the City. 

B. Public Safety 

1 . Opening of the Flint Lock-up . The lock-up opened the week of October 1 , 

2012. Public Safety Director Lock recommended selection of the Genesee 
County Sheriff as the operator of the Flint lock-up. Lock also recommended 
that the lock-up be made available to all policing agencies operating within 


2 



Genesee County for warrants and fresh charges, both felony and 
misdemeanor. Well over one thousand outstanding warrants are being 
cleared each month. This funding by the State has been very much 
appreciated and very beneficial to the City. 

2. Creating the Criminal Justice System Advisory Council chaired by Chief 
Judge Richard Yuille. In September 2012 the first meeting of the Criminal 
Justice System Advisory Council (CJSAC) was held. Eight workgroups were 
established. Through these work groups a number of cooperative projects, 
streamlined operations and new collaborations have been identified and 
numerous projects continue to move forward. 

3. Completing the transition to 800 MHz public safety communications system. 
Ail Public Safety departments were operational on the 800 MHz 
communications system in December of 2012. Flint Public Safety is now 
compatible with the communications system used throughout Genesee 
County and with the Michigan State Police. 

4. Securing public safety grants totaling over $1 1 million (not including State 
funded Lock-up). A $6.9 million SAFER grant to employ thirty-nine firefighters 
for two years was received in May 2012. The Mott Foundation has granted 
the City over $1 .8 million for several public safety initiatives. The Treasurer’s 
Office through the C-GAP funding awarded the City $1 .8 million to construct 
a 9-1-1 simulcast communications tower in April 2013. Homeland Security 
awarded Flint a total of $615,000 for 9-1-1 console upgrades and purchase 
of new radios for the 800 MHZ transition. 

5. Up-grading Police Department technology to improve data-driven decision 
making and capability for overall communications with Law Enforcement 
agencies at all levels of government. The Mott Foundation funded MSU 
Training & Technical Assistance Team conducted a technology audit which 
provided a road map of upgrades necessary to ensure that officers and 
firefighters can take maximum advantage of the tools already provided to 
them. New World Systems, Flint’s records management system, required 
server and switch upgrades before the New World update could be made. 
Each of these components has now been completed and the use of the full 
feature set of New World is being implemented throughout the FPD. 

6. Implementing 12 hour shifts for Police Patrol Officers which put more officers 
on the street and vastly reduced overtime in the department. 

7. Taking major steps toward the reconsolidation of the Flint City 9-1-1 with the 
Genesee County 9-1-1 consortium. The C-GAP grant to build the 
communications tower will enhance system coverage for the entire County. 

8. Improving Public Safety Response Recently compiled statistics for FBI Part 
One violent crimes show significant improvements have resulted from the 
implementation of many public safety initiatives. Overall violent crime is down 
an average of 24% in the first six months of 201 3 vs. the first six months of 
2012 . 


C. Infrastructure (this area includes water and sewer, waste collection, roads and 
streets, bridges, parks, facilities as well as commercial and residential demolition 
targets and blight in general) 


3 



1 . Stabilizing funding for water and sewer systems . This enterprise fund 
plunged from a $60 million dollar positive balance in 2007 to a $23M deficit in 
2012. By raising water and sewer rates more than 25%, reorganizations and 
improving technologies we have been able to stop the bleeding and stabilize 
funding for the long term. 

2. Significantly improving the process and cost of providing the Flint and 
Genesee County region with water by joining the KWA. Working with the 
County Drain Commissioner and others, we have begun this long awaited 
KWA project, which will result in several hundred million dollars in cost 
decreases to residents and businesses, i want to acknowledge former 
Emergency Financial Manager Edward Kurtz for his work and detailed 
analysis which brought this complicated process to a decision point. 

3. Reducing costs for Waste Collection and implementing Recycling . By moving 
to a fee for service and contracting with the private sector waste collection 
vendor, we eliminated a General Fund subsidy of more than $1 million 
annually, and for the first time ever we are able to offer city-wide curbside 
recycling. 

4. Finalizing the Smith Village construction project . This housing development 
project has languished for over ten years, important deadlines were ignored 
and Flint was in serious difficulty with HUD. Ed Kurtz cleaned up this tangled 
project, changed developers, and moved this project significantly toward its 
final steps. Thirty-six residences have been completed, seven have been 
sold and ten purchase agreements are in process. 

5. Updating of City's 50 year old Master Plan Mayor Wailing and Chief Planner 
Megan Hunter have coordinated a city-wide, tremendously inclusive planning 
effort. Hundreds of Flint citizens have worked on sub-committees, attended 
visioning sessions and worked hard to develop a plan for a revitalized Flint. 

6. Reducing overtime costs in the Utilities division , by implementing new 
technology and reorganizations. Examples include planned elimination of the 
solid waste incinerator and electronic monitoring of the Third Ave. Pumping 
Station. 

7. Disposing of unused inventory and facilities . Auctions have been used to 
eliminate surplus equipment and vehicles while city facilities which are no 
longer required and which we can not afford to operate are being sold or 
leased. 

8. Contracting management of city ooif courses and Senior Centers in order to 
reduce city costs and still provide access to residents. 

Achieving this level of success in twenty-two months has been extremely challenging. Obstacles 
have arisen from many sources. The team in Flint has taken on each challenge and worked with 
a single-mindedness to keep Flint on the path to sustainability. We firmly believe that with 
continued effort, Flint City government can once again become a financially stable organization 
capable of delivering quality municipal services to it residents, businesses, and visitors. This route 
will involve continued cost reductions, investments in technology and personnel, and additional 
sources of revenues. The alternative of bankruptcy is not the right path - it is expensive, time 
consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. 

There are several major issues which are currently on the horizon. The shortage of revenue to 
balance the FY15 Budget is the primary issue. Public Safety staffing is still at unacceptably low 


4 





levels and with current financial conditions it is likely that the number of police officers and 
firefighters will be reduced in order to achieve a balanced budget. This likelihood is enhanced by 
the pending expiration of the FEMA SAFER grant which supports the wages and benefits of 39 
firefighters. 

Blight is an on-going major issue in Flint. We have few resources and blight issues range from 
unmowed to demolition necessary properties. Flint recently received $20 million in Federal 
“Hardest Hit” funds to demolish approximately 1600 residences, yet we have 20,000 abandoned 
homes and hundreds of vacant commercial properties. 

There has been disagreement within the community regarding the appointment of an Emergency 
Manager, about the difficult choices which were made to impose higher water and sewer rates, 
street lighting assessment and waste collection fees, and about other decisions. Yet, there has 
been no civil unrest, as threatened by a few voices. There was significant support to increase 
property taxes in an economically distressed city, because voters saw that this was the right 
choice for Flint. 

With the changes of the magnitude needed to address Flint’s conditions, there is no doubt 
controversy, disagreement, and anger can result. Often, the most vocal represent the fewest 
number. I have worked with many in the City of Flint who understand the severity of our condition 
and the scope of effort necessary to address it. If you have questions about the support given for 
the direction I have taken to restore Flint to financial solvency, i offer the names of the following 
citizens for you to contact:

I have been a member of the Flint community for over thirty-five years. I grew up on the North 
End in one of the few integrated Flint neighborhoods; my wife and I raised five children, all of 
whom graduated from the Flint Community Schools. I have served Flint as a Runaway 
Counselor, Child Care Operator, Red Cross and United Way Director and as an elected official. I 
have interacted and earned the respect of a broad array of people in Flint. 1 hear from people all 
over the City on a regular basis and I have been pleased to receive their constant support and 
encouragement. 

Please know that I will do everything possible to make this transition smooth and successful. We 
all have to keep our eye on the goal of putting Flint on a path to solvency, safety and 
regeneration.

New Year Update from Flint Mayor Walling 


Now that we are in the new year, I want to send you a note to let you know that we are at an exciting point in Flint’s 
redevelopment due to all of the tremendous contributions that our citizens and partners made in this past year, especially 
with the new comprehensive master plan that provides a road map for creating the community we envision. Thank you for 
your hard work and dedication throughout this past year to bring us to this point of opportunity. 

The City of Flint does continue to face significant challenges, however a number of announcements in the past few 
months show that Flint is regaining its vibrancy. Many of you have asked me for the highlights and it is a great list. There 
have been announcements of developments for more than $900 Million including $600 Million by GM, $270 Million by the 
KWA Water Pipeline, $20 Million in Demolition, $10 Million in Brownfield Cleanups, $15 Million by American Pipe, $4 
Million by Genesys downtown, and $1 .5 Million for Cops in Schools. This adds up to greater economic opportunity, a 
higher quality of life, and more tax base for us going forward. Let me know if you want more information on any of these 
projects. 

We do have momentum and 2014 is going to a good year for Flint as the master plan begins to be implemented with the 
combined capital improvement plan, a revised zoning code, and a number of important neighborhood and development 
projects. Through our combined efforts, we are demonstrating that, at our core, we are a dynamic and progressive 
community. We have gone from a lumber center to a carriage town to an auto center and now we are changing again to a 
diverse and sustainable 21st Century city. 


More than 5,000 people participated in the Imagine Flint planning process and there will continue to 
be ways for everyone to engage. Take a look at the strategies in each of the chapters on land use, 
neighborhoods, transportation, infrastructure, parks, public safety, economic development, education, 
and the arts and start thinking about how you can contribute to Flint’s future success. The Master 
Plan for a Sustainable Flint is online at www. irnaqineflint.com . 


Our vision lays out how we are adapting to change and using partnerships while we provide for the 
fundamental needs of all people, how we can be good stewards of our environment, develop a 
diverse economy, provide safe neighborhoods, and nurture our youth. I hope you will use this vision 
and the guiding principles for inspiration for how you can align with our vision, goals and objectives. 

This will not be any easy process but I know the force of our united community and supporters is 
powerful enough to overcome our challenges when we work together. Here's to a fantastic new year 
in Flint. 

All the best, 

Mayor Dayne Walling

I. Introduction 


A. Recognize Council 

B. Family 

C. Elected Officials incl newest Representative Phelps 

Good afternoon and welcome. Thank you for joining me here today at my fifth annual 
State of the City address. 

Thank City Council President, City Council members and City Clerk for hosting... 

As I mentioned, this is my fifth annual State of the City address. If I had been elected 
and re-elected under normal circumstances, then this would be the first state of the city 
address of my second full term. But we know that these past 5 years have been 
everything except normal. Economic, financial, political and social challenges as great 
as this City has ever seen have met us every morning as we have worked tirelessly 
through the day and night to comeback from the worst economic downtown in a century, 
to push back against a crime wave that carried us to the top of the worst list in the 
country to be on, to keep everyone here at City Hall working in the best interests of the 
public, residents and taxpayers despite conflicting opinions about collective bargaining 
agreements, local home rule, and city service standards. 

Nevertheless, we continue to come together, to this sacred public place. I thank Elder 
Sanders for the invocation. Many of us do what we do each day because of our faith. 

We know that we are each called to be here in this place at this time for a purpose. I 
want to recognize all of the pastors and faith leaders who are here today. Please stand 
and let us recognize you for your leadership and service. 

I am thankful every day for the opportunity--and strength--to serve as your mayor in 
these difficult times. I am also personally thankful every day for the wonderful family that 
surrounds and supports me...

I want to recognize our elected officials who have joined me here today... 

Note newest State Rep Phil Phelps 

I also want to recognize Flint’s EM Darnell Earley and all of the City of Flint officials who 
have taken time to be here this afternoon. Thank you. 



II. State of the City Summary: "Smaller yet Stronger and Smarter” 

A. Citizen Priorities 

B. 2013 Accomplishments & Challenges (City Govt and Community) 

C. Adoption of Master Plan 

D. Key Project Highlights 

a. General Motors & UAW: Paint Shop 

b. SC2: White House Domestic Policy Council 

c. Michigan State University: Medical School 

d. Lavarne Ross, Flint Heritage Exhibit at FIA 

When I look back over my first four years in office compared with where we are today, I 
believe that the State of the City of Flint is that we are smaller yet stronger and smarter. 
Flint is smaller yet stronger and smarter in 2014. 

As an example, last year’s budget which ended last June, was balanced through a 
mixture of significant revenue increases, significant expenditure decreases, and steps 
taken to reduce long term costs. Expenditure reductions included elimination of 20 
percent of the City’s workforce, compensation decreases equivalent to a 20 percent 
wage reduction for remaining employees, and the restructuring of health and retirement 
benefits. 

The financial statements as of June 30, 2013 show that revenues exceeded expenses 
in the General Fund by $6.3 million. And more people are paying their taxes. Delinquent 
collection efforts focus not only on income tax but on personal property tax and 
miscellaneous receivables. Since, the establishment of new enforcement efforts last 
year, $451,196 has been collected in total for delinquent taxes and personal property 
taxes. 

All of this resulted in the City’s accumulated general fund deficit being reduced to less 
than $12.9 million as of June 30, 2013. We have a long way to go but progress is being 
made. Flint is smaller yet stronger and smarter in 2014. 



The current budget was designed and implemented with the same goals in mind - 
operating within the constraints of available revenues; restructuring operations and cost 
factors to enhance future financial stability, and continuing to reduce the remaining 
deficit. The budget includes reducing the deficit by a minimum of $1 million. As of 
January 31, 2014, seven months into the FY14 year, revenues and expenses are on 
target. 

Nevertheless, there remains a list of critical challenges and threats that must be 
resolved but today there are 7 items on the list instead of more like 27. The proposed 
transition management plan calls for action on a deficit elimination plan, a five-year 
financial analysis and two-year budget, governance reforms, organizational 
development, legacy cost reduction, adoption of a strategic plan, and ongoing 
sustainability around training, best-practices and planning. 

Myself and all of the City Council members are engaged with the Emergency Manager 
Darnell Earley, staff and consultants in order to address these challenges and threats 
as fully and quickly as possible. I compliment the steps taken by the City Council’s 
Finance Committee towards putting in place a City of Flint Strategic Plan at their 
meeting this past week. This is the kind of leadership that is going to achieve the goal of 
transition to home rule that I set in this address last year. 

While the challenges are serious, we also have significant accomplishments from 2013 
to build on. 

The Law Office is one area that has dramatically improved in recent years under the 
leadership of City Attorney Peter Bade. As an example, during 2013, we had numerous 
litigation successes, with lawsuits against the City either dismissed or settled at low 
cost. We stayed under budget for suits and settlements, and are at a historic low for 
what we spend on litigation going back 1 5 years. This is due in large part to the Law 
Office handling cases directly. Presently, there are 1 1 1 active litigation matters. Only 5 


7 



matters are being handled by outside counsel in partnership with a staff attorney. We 
have met or bettered the 95% of litigation being handled by staff attorneys for the past 
four years. This is responsible management that serves taxpayers and the City of Flint. 

Another accomplishment is the master plan. Last year in the State of the City I set a 
goal of adopting a new comprehensive master plan for Flint in 2013. In October, with 
the unanimous support of the Flint Planning Commission and the Flint City Council, 
Flint’s first comprehensive master plan since 1960 was adopted! That item had been on 
the to-do list for my whole life — and now we are in a position to move forward with clear 
alignment among our vision, guiding principles, goals, objectives, strategies, resources 
and metrics. 

More than 5,000 volunteers and engaged citizens were the driving force in Flint’s 
master planning process. I am so proud of the way people dedicated thousands upon 
thousands of hours to imagining a better Flint and deciding on strategies to make our 
vision a reality. 

Think about the math of public participation here. At one event alone, the community 
visioning workshop last March at Mott Community College, there were nearly 500 
people for a full day of discussion and goal-setting. The hours that volunteers 
contributed that day alone are equivalent to 2 full time employees for the city of Flint 
working all year long. Citizen engagement is a force multiplier. 

Our efforts going forward, from crime fighting to blight elimination, youth development 
and governance improvements, are all going to take more and more volunteers and 
community leaders. The actions of a few individuals can have a strong impact on 
addressing the issues we face as a city, but that impact is multiplied when more 
residents and community leaders take an active role and get involved.

Instead of working against each other, we are using more and more of our energy to 
collaborate. As you will hear with law enforcement partnerships and the new water 
pipeline, collaboration is a force multiplier too. 

Flint, smaller yet stronger and smarter. 

What a difference a smart plan can make! Especially when it is backed up by 
community volunteers, and partners who are collaborating and investing. 

Since the master plan was adopted in October, there have been a number of positive 
announcements around collaboration as well as new development initiatives that are in 
alignment with the plan for a sustainable — in the sense of economic, social and 
environmental — Flint. 

Let’s start with General Motors and the spectacular ground-breaking this morning. 

GM will invest $600 million for construction of a new paint shop for the assembly plant. 
This is the largest private investment made in the City of Flint in nearly a decade. The 
facility will be the third new paint facility in North America to use an environmentally 
friendly wet-coat paint process. The New addition will be a 596,000 ft 2 building that in 
total represents approximately 1 million construction work hours. The completion target 
is in 2016. 

I want to recognize... [GM Representatives] 

Now there are currently 2,800 hourly and 250 salaried employees at Flint Assembly. 
The workers are represented by UAW Local 598. 

I want to recognize UAW Region 1-C and our Locals... Including 


9 



When the paint shop is finished, GM will have invested more than $1 .5 billion in its Flint 
operations since early 2009. This is an incredible testament to the working men and 
women of the UAW, GM’s leadership, and the community of Flint. 

Flint Engine has received more than $700 million, including $215 million announced last 
year to upgrade the plant for a new small gas engine and an engine for GM’s midsize 
pickups including the Colorado and the Canyon. Flint Assembly also received $328 
million to retool the plant for production of the next generation full-size pickup. 

In Flint, we have been known for vehicle manufacturing and innovation for more than a 
hundred years. It is great to see General Motors also stepping up to preserve the 
carriage and early auto industry heritage with their acquisition of Flint Carriage Factory 
One. This is another investment along the University Avenue corridor that is bringing in 
new energy and will attract people to our community. 

These latest investments by General Motors are proof that Flint will continue to be a 
hub in the auto industry. 1 am pleased to be working with my colleagues, Mayor 
Duggan, Mayor Bernero, and others, along with Michigan State, the University of 
Michigan and Wayne State University for Michigan’s Manufacturing Triangle to be 
recognized by President Obama as a Manufacturing Community region. We are proud 
of our heritage and our future in this growing global industry sector— and we want to the 
world to know! 

We already have the honor of being chosen by the White House as one of the Strong 
Cities, Strong Communities or SC2 sites for this year. President Obama’s Secretary for 
Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan has recognized Flint’s new plan and 
sees the SC2 support as a way to assist with implementing the plan, especially around 
reducing crime, eliminating blight and redeveloping brownfield properties. These are all 
priorities that will position Flint to be more competitive economically. It is wonderful that 
our work is being recognized on Pennsylvania Avenue in our Nation’s Capital and we 
look forward to the project leader being placed in Flint in the near future. 


10 



Our comprehensive master plan also commits us to further diversifying our economy. 
Chapter 9, Economic Development and Education, Objective 8. 

There is no better example of our growth and diversification than the expansion of the 
education and medical sectors in Flint. I can’t tell you how proud I am, as a Flinstone 
and Spartan myself, to see the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine 
establishing a campus in downtown Flint as part of the new Health and Wellness 
District. 

Let’s recognize the leaders and doctors who are here representing MSU 
Their energy and talents are already making Flint smarter for sure. 

The CS Mott Foundation and Uptown Reinvestment nonprofit corporation have 
supported this work in all ways imaginable, i want to recognize Ridgway White, the Vice 
President of Special Projects at the C.S. Mott Foundation. 

The Health and Wellness district bring together our medical and education assets and 
focuses them in the core of our community. The District already has investment 
commitments of over $60 million over more than 4 city blocks. Over $30 million is 
committed for bricks and mortar construction. The District is backed by an additional 
$30 M in programming provided by the C.S. Mott Foundation, MSU and our three 
medical institutions: Hurley, McLaren and Genesys. 

It is anchored by Exploration Park, the MSU Masters of Public Health and College of 
Human Medicine, the expansion and relocation of the Flint Farmers Market and 
Genesys facilities. The District is creating over 150 new high paying jobs at MSU and 
Genesys in addition, plus there will be numerous entrepreneurial opportunities at the 
market and commercial kitchen. The primary goal of the District is to provide an 
opportunity for various health and medical related businesses to co locate downtown. 


11 



The first new component to opens its doors was the Genesys Health Clinic on Saginaw 
Street, which is the west end of the district. And now Genesys is adding a PACE senior 
center on the east end of the district across from UM-Flint Residence Hall. 

Representing Flint’s medical sector is a delegation from Genesys led by CEO Betsy 
Aderholt. Please rise and be recognized... 

We are a lot more than a car town, a college town or medical hub, we are growing a 
diverse and sustainable economy for the 21 st Century. We also continue to honor those 
who brought us to this place and the arts and culture that have become so important to 
our community. I asked Lavarne Ross, one of Flint’s finest artists and painters to join us 
here today. He has an amazing exhibit at the Flint Insitute of Arts that you have to see. 
The special exhibit, Lavarne Ross: Works on Paper features 19 works of art including 
pencil, chalk, acrylic and watercolor. You will see the Flint’s electric trolleys, the Kresge 
store downtown, the Buick, an wonderful images of Flint’s families. He is ensuring that 
we continue to honor our heritage which has brought us to where we are today. Arts 
and Culture is an important part of our plan going forward. 

So when you add up all of the investment commitments this past year in Flint’s private 
sector, public infrastructure, key initiatives, and redevelopment projects, the total is 
nearly one billion dollars. Flint, smaller yet stronger and smarter — attracting attention, 
energy and resources. This is what happens when you have a great plan, a team effort, 
and a united and engaged community. 

We continue to need all of your involvement as we work to implement the master plan 
for a sustainable Flint. In fact, the next steering committee meeting is open to the public 
and takes place tomorrow night, Tuesday March 4 starting at 5:30pm at the Flint Public 
Library. Moreover, the Steering Committee has approved a set of Implementation Task 
Groups for each chapter or area of the master plan. Today I am announcing that the 
application process to be on one of the task groups is open to the public and available 
here this afternoon. It is on the list of Top Ways to Implement the Master Plan — a new 


12 



list that you will receive as you leave today. We are looking for people who will 
champion the plan, work to see it implemented, and have a passion for this place and 
our community. 1 know all of you here fit the bill and I encourage you to apply. 
Remember, volunteers are force multipliers. We need you!

111. Action Plan: Implementing the Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint 


We need you to prove that this plan is not going to sit on a shelf. We have a 
responsibility to see the master plan for a sustainable Flint implemented. Under state 
law, the master plan is supposed to be updated every 5 years — NOT every 50! So the 
way I see it, we have 5 years to implement the short term action items, get started on 
the medium and long term work, and then actually update and amend the plan in 2018. 
We need to approach the implementation process like a 5 Year Action Plan — 
starting this year! I am calling for 2014 to be a Year of Service and Action. . .As the 
first step in a five year process to realize our vision and improve all parts of our 
community. 

Yes we need to identify new financial resources, but more than that, we need more and 
more people and partners in our community to step up and do their part to implement 
the plan. This is why you saw the resource tables set up in the lobby, so that after this 
you can sign up to help in all kinds of different and important ways. This is what I really 
want to talk about this afternoon. A 5 Year Action Plan and 2014 as a Year of Service 
and Action. 


The plan is over 250 double sized pages so I don’t have time to read all of it here. I am 
going to focus on the aspects related to the 5 community priorities that were established 
right at the beginning of the engagement process with the first round of meetings, 
surveys and workshops. The areas are: 

a) increasing safety 

b) creating jobs 

c) addressing blight 

d) improving infrastructure, and 

e) reforming governance 

Let's go through our goals and answer the questions: What did we do last year and 
what are we going to do this year to make progress on each of these priority areas? 


14 




A. Increase Safety 

a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Chiefs Tolbert and Cox, MSP and Partners 

Our goal with safety is simple: We see Flint providing a secure and healthy environment 
for residents, businesses, students and visitors. 

We have 8 objectives in the masterplan that range from developing a state-of-the-art 
efficient and proactive police department to empowering residents to contribute to the 
safety of their neighborhoods. 

The Flint Police and Fire Departments made great strides in 2013 with their 
organizational development and also results: crime and arson rates were down by 
double digits in 2013 compared with the year before, and the trend is continuing into 
2014. 

I want to recognize Flint Police Chief James Tolbert and Flint Fire Chief David Cox for 
their extraordinary service to our community. Chiefs! 

In addition to Flint leadership, another main reason why Flint is a safer community today 
compared with this time last year is the continued dedication of our county, state and 
federal law enforcement partners who are working with us to get offenders off of our 
streets everyday. The US Attorneys Zero Tolerance gun crime prosecutions has 
removed many of the most dangerous individuals who continue to break our laws from 
our neighborhoods. 

The Michigan State Police are there with us everyday. The Michigan State Police are 
assisting with everything from major case detective investigation to traffic enforcement 
and response. This means that Flint Police officers are more available to respond to 91 1 
calls and to community issues. 


15 



[ want to recognize Col. Kristi Etu, commander of the Michigan State Police, who is with 
us here today, Col.! We deeply appreciate your efforts here in Flint. We also have with 
us Lt. Col. Thomas Sands, thank you sir. 

I also want to recognize Harvey Hollins, The Director of the Governor’s Office of Urban 
and Metropolitan Initiatives, and Brian Larkin, the Flint liaison for the office. 

The State of Michigan, with Governor Snyder’s leadership, has also invested in Flint by 
funding the City Lockup. I can state as a fact that the city lock up has been an effective 
crime fighting strategy, it has also been a regional crime fighting tool as it is available for 
use by all policing agencies in Genesee County with the Sheriff’s administration. In total 
949 felons and 1576 misdemeanors were processed by the lockup in 2013. The 
Governor has proposed that the funding continue going forward and we urge the State 
Legislature to support this critical investment that is in alignment with our plan to reduce 
crime. 

There are always competing needs when it comes to a budget and funding, but I believe 
that the data from Flint shows that these dollars are providing a high return on 
investment. As State revenues continue to come in above projections, I suggest public 
safety be a top priority. The sad fact is that the State of Michigan, with all of its local 
units combined, have approximately 2,000 fewer police officers than we had 10 years 
ago. Now that State revenues are back to pre-recession levels there needs to be a 
major investment in public safety — so that everything else we aim to do with education, 
economic development, and neighborhood stabilization has the foundation of safe 
community to build upon. 

I urge the Governor and State Legislature to fully fund local revenue sharing and invest 
in initiatives in the Governor’s Secure Cities proposal before lowering tax rates, lt is not 
fair to make local communities pay the price of the recession and then divert our 
recovery. 


16 



I also call on Flint's voters to support the statewide referendum in August for the State 
to provide a 100% replacement for tax revenues that will be changed with the reform of 
the business equipment, or personal property, tax. 

You see how public safety, being 80% of Flint’s General Fund budget, is as much 
determined by budget and legislative priorities as it is by the community's needs. 

Thankfully, Flint’s citizens are not waiting on the Capitol to tackle crime in their 
neighborhoods alongside of law enforcement. Chief Tolbert has made it a high priority 
to strengthen relationships with community groups. In the master plan, this is the 
second objective on public safety, and second only to eliminating blight which I will 
speak to later. 

Working with community groups and concerned citizens is how we are going to reduce 
crime in Flint. The Flint Police department has a new commitment to placing each 
neighborhood and block club meeting on the patrol calendar so that Command Officers 
know to attend. 

The Flint Police Department is also operating in a more transparent fashion and 
providing information on a daily basis to the public about major crimes. This is posted 
every day on the City of Flint’s website. In the future, a new interactive online tool will be 
in place for citizens and community groups to input specific geographic parameters and 
receive crime updates 3 times a day. New Flint Police facebook and twitter accounts will 
be started this month. 

We need to share more information and also connect more with the community. With 
Blue Badge and the Flint Neighborhoods United, a new training will be offered for crime 
watches to patrol as eyes and ears and rapidly report any criminal behavior. FPD has 
radios we are in the process of narrow banding to use in this effort. We have submitted 
an application for a grant to cover this initiative with the expectation of starting the 
advanced community watches this spring. 


17 



We have an expanded effort with CrimeStoppers through the CrimeStoppers of 
Michigan. You can call 1-800-SPEAKUP with tips to help solve crimes with a guarantee 
of it being 1 00% anonymous. Flint Crime stoppers did an outstanding Job yet we 
needed the expanded resources that CrimeStoppers of Michigan could bring to the 
table. Crime Stoppers of Michigan has been in Flint/Genesee Co. for exactly one month, 
we have received 30 tips in Genesee County, 29-F!int, 1 -Fenton, Tips have been 
submitted for rewards. 

It is part of the new mission of the Flint Police Department to act in partnership with our 
community to protect life and property by striving to prevent crime and preserve peace, 
order and safety. 

Partnerships. Community. Protection. Crime Prevention. Peace. This sounds like a 21 st 
Century police department. 

Now we all need to step up. Volunteer with Blue Badge. Contribute to the new Flint 
Police Foundation. Get involved with Lifelines. Call tips into CrimeStoppers. Check the 
online crime stats. Check on your neighbor. This is how we are going to get Flint off the 
top 10 worst per capita crime list this year!

B. Create Jobs 

a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Planning & Development Dept, and Metro Youth Build 

Of course we also need to create jobs. Our goal for creating jobs is ambitious. We aim 
to have a growing and diverse economy that spurs innovation and small business 
development along with an education system that prepares our workforce, Flint’s 
residents for jobs paving a livable wage . 

We link economic development and education because we believe that human 
development is economic development. We know where we need to start. Community 
schools and community education is objective one, strategy one. All of us who grew up 
here in Flint know that community schools work for youth, for families, for communities 
and for employers. Community education must be there in the fall of 2014 when the 
doors of the Flint Community Schools open for our students. 

The City of Flint is requesting proposals from community partners who will work with the 
Flint Community Schools using federal Community Development Block Grants to 
provide community education services. Superintendent Larry Watkins is a product of the 
community education system — and a graduate of Flint Central High School I should 
add — and he recognizes that this is fundamental. I urge other partners to pledge 
themselves to this work as well. We must work together to get this done. Community 
schools is objective one, strategy one for a growing and diverse economy. 

Objective two is to increase the basic skills of our youth and workforce. One of the 
major successes is the Youth Build program that has moved into the City’s Oak 
Business Center. Metro Community Development initiated this in Flint and is one of the 
leading programs across the country. Today a new group of Youth Build participants 
started and they are going to help us meet our objective here. 


19 



I want to recognize Metro’s director Ravi Yalamanchi and program manager Mark 
Evans. Thank you for believing in our youth and working with us to make this program a 
success. 

The City is stepping up to do our part. A new unified Department of Planning and 
Development has been established to lead our public economic development efforts, 
make Flint more business friendly, and ensure equitable redevelopment across all of 
Flint. I want to recognize the inaugural head of the new Department of Planning and 
Development, Megan Hunter who also serves as our Chief Planning Officer and was the 
primary architect of our adopted master plan. Please join me in showing appreciation for 
Ms. Hunter’s amazing work. We want to encourage her in this ground-breaking 
endeavor. 

I also want to recognize the Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce and the Michigan 
Economic Development Corporation. We meet every Friday morning in my office to go 
over every job creation and investment prospect for Flint. Over the past 4+ years this 
has resulted in more than 4905 created and retained jobs along with $1 .5 billion in 
capital investments through 2013. Our total capital investment will be over $2 billion 
after this year. Our performance this past year with job growth and retention is that we 
achieved 60% more than the previous year so we are on a strong upward swing. 

Our latest success is with bringing the American Pipe company to the former Buick site. 

I look forward to people going to work again where there used to be empty concrete 
slabs. When you see Flint & Genesee in the light of cooperation, innovation, and 
opportunity, you will believe that we can do this as part of our 5 Year Action Plan. 

This year we have a lot to do to create jobs. Its time for a Promise Zone for Flint. Our 
state legislators are stepping up on this one. ts time to update all of Flint's business 
ordinances so we are truly business friendly and redevelopment ready. The City 
Council, Clerk and City Attorney are working to get this done in the next 60 days. This is 
the commitment I made in my first act in office when I hung on open for business sign 


20 



on the front doors of City Hall. We will have a pfan. We will have a process. We will 
have partners. And we will turn this economy around and create job opportunities right 
here in Flint! A strong and smart economy, now that’s SUSTAINABILITY. 

And for those who are looking for work, consider this since I am talking a lot today about 
volunteering. A recent study by the Federal Corporation for National and Community 
Service Office of Research & Evaluation found that active volunteers have a 27% higher 
odds of finding a job afater being out of work than non-volunteers. Volunteers without a 
high school diploma have a 51% higher odds of finding employment. This research 
shows that volunteering increases a person’s social network and skill sets and this 
helps to level the playing field for the unemployed when they apply for jobs. 

Volunteering is an employment multiplier. 


21 



C. Address Blight 

A Declare War on Blight 

b. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

c. Recognize Cities of Service & Chief Service Officer 

Action Area 3. Address Blight. Blight is a clear and present danger to our future. It 
affects our safety, our neighborhoods, our businesses, our youth. The abandoned 
buildings surrounding us offer shelter for crime and drugs. Scrapped out buildings in our 
neighborhoods endanger our children when they walk to school. We no longer can dwell 
in the dangerous remains of the past. This is not a new problem in Flint but the scale of 
the challenge has pushed up the threat level and it is time for an all-out battle against 
blight! 

It is us versus abandonment, us versus scrapping, us versus illegal dumping, and those 
of us who care versus those among us who have given up. 

St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “If the Trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will 
get ready for battle?” 

Today I blow the trumpet against blight. 

Today Flint declares a war on blight. 

I am asking you today to enlist in the army that will defeat blight in Flint over the next 5 
years. Are you with me? 

There are over 20,000 homeowners living in their homes in Flint. This is a great asset to 
build from that a lot of people don't realize we still have. 

Last year with Cities of Service alone, we had 593 volunteers who were on the front 
lines. The Cities of Service volunteers accomplished much: 


22 



24 Blocks revitalized 

1 ,804,273 pounds of yard waste removed 
1 5 trees planted 

57 new green spaces or gardens created 

25 homes boarded 

4,500 sqft of graffiti removed 

122 previously blighted properties cleaned and maintained 


This was a strong start in our campaign to beat blight in Flint over the next 5 years. 
There were 670 demolitions total in 2013, between the City and the Land Bank. This 
year we are going to demolish approximately more than double that, approximately 
2000 structures. And we are ready for more volunteers in the army for all branches of 
the service: Cities of Service, Keep Genesee County Beautiful Park Tenders and Tree 
Tenders, Flint Neighborhoods United, and all of the groups that are already in this fight 
all across the city. 

The demolitions are funded by the Federal government through the State. The 
champion for us in Washington, DC has been our new Congressman Dan Kildee. It is 
unprecedented for a first year congressman to achieve these results and his success is 
a great testament to his trust with the President’s administration and leaders here in the 
State. Congressman Dan Kildee, thank you for your willingness to keep fighting for Flint! 
We need you to lead us in this war. 

Because the battles in front of us are tough. After this year’s work we estimate that we 
will have approximately 5,500 residential structures and 400 commercial buildings still in 
need of demolition at a total cost of $70 million. 

Total blight elimination means cleaning up vacant properties, creating new green 
spaces, and beautifying our neighborhoods. Regular mowing on all of the 12,000 plus 
vacant lots in Flint calculate to 100,000 cuts. Last year our community groups made an 
incredible start with over 10,000 cuts. We must aim to double our effort every year to 
win this front of the blight battle. The Cities of Service grant is supporting the 


23 



Community Tool Shed at Salem Housing where mowers and equipment can be 
borrowed free of charge. 

I also am proud to announce that we have an additional new field captain, a Chief 
Service Officer for the City of Flint through the Cities of Service initiative and an 
executive on loan program with the Boys and Girls Club and the National Service 
Accelerator funded by the CS Mott Foundation. This is at no cost to the City’s 
taxpayers. Smaller but stronger and smarter. Using volunteers, collaborating and 
investing. 

Mary ZumBrunnen’s first official day is tomorrow. She comes to this position from 
having been working on the service accelerator with national service members, 
AmeriCorps, VISTA, Senior Corps and other service efforts that have connected over 
650 national service members and over 2,000 volunteers with efforts meeting the needs 
of our community. And I am pleased that she is joining the City of Flint — at no cost to 
the City! Please welcome Mary ZumBrunnen. 

There is a role for everyone in the army advancing against blight. Neighborhood 
revitalization is everyone’s responsibility, yet we know that the City has to provide the 
leadership and the tools for you to be effective. I am proud to announce the second 
annual LOVE YOUR CITY month this May to give the entire city a spring cleaning. We 
have to have a strong spring campaign once the snow melts so we don’t lose any 
ground. 

In partnership with Cities of Service and Republic Services, we have three unlimited 
curbside pickup weeks. 

- Unlimited large items: May 5-9 

- Unlimited bagged litter: May 12-26 

- Unlimited bundled branches/lawn debris: May 19-23 


24 



We need to wear these unlimited pickups out! When I drive down the street on Monday 
May 5 th I want to see unlimited large items on the curbs. On Monday May 1 9 th , I want to 
see unlimited bundled branches and bagged lawn debris. May is the month to make it 
happen as part of the 2014 Year of Service and Action. Put it on the calendar. These 
are your three weeks of blight battling. Don’t drive up north to go fishing. Don’t head 
down south to see your family. Stay right here in Flint, take out the trash, bag that 
garbage from down the street, clean up the vacant lot on the block, I want to see 
Republic working overtime to keep up with us! 

We are also going to do another tire collection day on May 17 lh and we need you for 
that too, so don’t plan on that weekend for your family reunion. Getting all those old tires 
out is a dirty job but somebody has to do it! 

Now we all need to enlist and fight. The Cities of Service Love Your Block application 
will be available at the Keep Genesee County Beautiful conference this coming 
Saturday. The Ruth Mott Foundation has been a champion of this work for a number of 
years now. 

There are so many ways to make a difference in the blight battle. 

Take care of the vacant property next to your house - shovel snow, mow the yard, pick 
up trash. Report blight and code violations to the City’s Blight Manager, Raul Garcia 

Help organize a clean up for Love Your City Month. 


Apply for a mini-grant for your neighborhood from the Community Foundation, who is a 
great partner in implementing the master plan. 

This is how we are going to fulfill our vision for healthy neighborhoods all over the City 
over the next 5 years. 


25 



D. Improve Infrastructure 

a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Flint River Allies & Karegnondi Water Authority 

Infrastructure — roads, pipes, trails, water — this is another high priority area for Flint. We 
have set a visionary goal in the chapters on transportation, infrastructure and 
community facilities: 

Flint will enjoy a system of reliable and efficient infrastructure and multi-modal 
transportation tailored to meet local needs, and will have a network of comprehensive 
community facilities provided in a coordinated and collaborative manner. 

We have also come out strong with demonstration projects already underway to show 
that we are going to operate in a new paradigm with public works. 

Thanks to the C.S. Mott Foundation, an engineering study is underway to assess the 
best way to put S. Saginaw Street on a road diet. This means reducing the space on the 
road way for vehicular traffic, slowing cars down, and making the corridor more 
accessible for pedestrians and bicyclists. This also can reduce the amount of roadway 
that we need to maintain. We want our transportation network to be safe for all people 
and all ages and not just be surface road expressways moving commuters in and out of 
the city at high speeds. 

Thanks to the Michigan Municipal League Place Plans initiative, we are also designing a 
rails to trails project called the Grand Traverse Greenway. We had a packed room of 
participants in December at the Word of Life church to identify the principles and 
opportunities that will guide the design process. The weather was terrible but it was a 
fantastic session. This is another example of how valuable community engagement is. 
This work needs to be owned by the community and that means folks have to show up 
and participate and that is what is happening coming out of the Imagine Flint planning 
process. 


26 



These projects are clear signs of progress under the objectives in the T ransportation 
section of the master plan. 

We also make a point in the master plan for a sustainable Flint of leveraging our natural 
resources such as our Lakes and River and location in the Great Lakes basin. There 
are a number of objectives related to the Flint River in the environmental features 
chapter, as well as the infrastructure chapter. For instance, objective 5 in the 
infrastructure chapter reads: “Expand opportunities for blue infrastructure” 

So what does this look like? I know when you drive over the Saginaw Street bridge in 
downtown Flint, today you see the decrepit Hamilton Dam. This is a high risk piece of 
infrastructure, right in the middle of the UM-Flint campus and the last barrier to flooding 
downtown during heavy storms. Now with the comprehensive master plan and the Flint 
River Watershed Coalition we have a solution to works towards that will protect the 
waterway, secure downtown, add value to the UM-Flint campus and create access to 
the river for recreational purposes. 

This is a good example of the difference a good plan, collaboration and an investment 
paradigm can make. 

If the City were operating in a reactionary mode, the City would have spent a million 
dollars to drive in concrete pilings to secure the Hamilton dam structure. We would have 
a new permanent monument to failure and the past in downtown Flint. Instead of this, 
and consistent with the master plan objectives of a healthy river waterway through Flint 
(objective 1 of the environmental plan), the City is committing the million dollars to the 
Flint River Restoration initiative. The funding pledge will be leveraged to generate up to 
an additional $4 Million in grant opportunities to create a series of cascades through 
downtown like many other cities have done successfully. The Flint River Restoration 
initiative is about best-practices, good planning, collaboration with partners. This is the 
new way of doing business in Flint and it is working.

The Flint River has helped sustain people in this area for eons. I am proud that we are 
becoming better stewards of this precious natural resource. I am thankful to the 
hundreds of volunteers, the Flint River Watershed Coalition, the Friends of the Flint 
River Trail, and ali of the people who continue to work with us on preserving our part of 
Pure Michigan through the Flint River Corridor Alliance. This includes the University 
Avenue Corridor with Kettering University and Atwood Stadium. A number of 
representatives of our Flint River and corridor allies are here, please stand and be 
recognized. 

Another way you will be able to experience the Flint River is at a revamped Riverbank 
Park. Grants have been secured that will allow for work to begin soon on Riverbank 
Park to make the park ADA accessible and easier to maintain thanks to support from 
the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Trust Fund, the Ruth Mott Foundation, 
the Downtown Development Authority and other community partners and volunteers. 

Another partnership around water that I have to recognize is the Karegnondi Water 
Authority or KWA. This regional entity has become a catalyst for the communities along 
the 1-69 corridor to come together and help each other. We each have unique assets 
from manufacturing to agriculture, urban environments to rural areas that add up to 
more than the sum of the parts and create new opportunities for economic 
development, trade, and innovation. 

KWA is also our future water supply, straight from Lake Huron to the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant at Stewart and Dort Highway. The bond financing for the new pipeline 
is proceeding and the construction schedule is on time. It will take nearly 3 years to get 
the lake water flowing. 

In between, we will leave the Detroit water system now that we have permission 


28 



from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to use the river as a temporary 
primary water source for the next few years as needed until the KWA pipeline can be 
completed. 

This will provide significant savings to the City on the costs of water supply for future 
years. We have been honest that this may not mean lower bills but we will escape the 
escalating costs of the Detroit system because we will be able to manage the water 
treatment system ourselves. The result will be a better capacity here in Flint to mange 
the costs to residents and other customers going forward. The preliminary results from 
the water rate study affirms these savings relative to the Detroit costs. When finalized, 
the data will be shared with the new City Council Public Works Committee and the 
public. The bottom line is that with the master plan, the coming combined capital 
improvement plan, and local control, Flint will be able to maintain the water system 
better. 

One of the ways we will do this is that beginning this Spring, we will be using treated 
water from the Flint River as our temporary primary water source. In recent months and 
due to the eventual increase in use of our Flint Water Treatment Plan, upgrades have 
been made to meet the standards of continuous operation. Instead of paying a bill to 
Detroit, we are investing in Flint's infrastructure and capacity in an efficient manner. 

The track record at the Flint Water Treatment Plan is excellent. For many years, the 
river has been used as the backup system to provide drinking water for Genesee 
County. Because of this function, the Flint Water T reatment Center has conducted 
quarterly water treatment to ensure that river water meets stringent standards. These 
treatments have been done as a test to ensure the plant’s use as a temporary water 
supply should service from DWSD be interrupted. Each time these treatment tests have 
conducted, the water has passed the test. 

So later this Spring we will all be drinking Pure Flint Michigan Natural Mineral Water. 
There is a difference in density of minerals found in river water versus that of a large 


29 



freshwater body like Lake Huron. The new water will be properly treated, lightly 
fluorinated, and will taste slightly different than the water from Lake Huron that came 
through Detroit. Pure Flint Michigan Natural Mineral Water. 

And, once the KWA pipeline is completed, the river will remain as our back-up water 
source should the need arise. See, with a long-term plan in place, then every 
expenditure can meet a current need and contribute to our future resilience. This is a 
landmark project which will assist in the transition to a sustainable Flint. 

We have a number of the leaders on the Flint Water Treatment Plant and KWA here, 
including KWA CEO Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright, all of you please 
stand and be recognized... 


The City's Department of Public Works, which consists of Utilities, Transportation, 
Sanitation, and Facilities, is working on a number of operational changes too, because 
while being good stewards of the natural environment is important, we know we need to 
save some money around here! 

Recently the City of Flint has successfully implemented and tested an automation 
process at the 3 rd Ave. Pump Station facility. This has historically been a continuously 
manned operation (24/7) costing over a half million a year. We now have full remote 
control of all of the pumping, screening and control operations reducing the cost by over 
$315,000 annually. 

At the Pollution Control Facility, the sewer plant, engineering plans are near complete 
that will eliminate the use of the incinerator. Construction will begin this year and after 
completion should result in another half million savings annually. 

Over the next 5 years, think of what we will accomplish. 

$5 million in savings from these 2 plant changes alone 


30 



We will have control of our own lake water supply with the river backup 

We will have a more natural Flint River with better parks 

Our roads will be safer and easier to maintain and trails will connect the city 

I can’t wait to see it all for myself. This is the Flint we imagine for the 21 st Century. 



E. Reform Governance 


a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Blue Ribbon 

c. Partnership Approach with State, EM, Mayor and Council 

There is one more priority area that I need to address. It came up in every community 
planning session. Flint’s Governance. We have to make changes. One of the most 
important objectives in the Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint is Objective #9 in the 
Infrastructure and Community Facilities Plan. It was placed here because of its 
importance related to the City’s large financial commitments in utilities, but it applies 
across the board. And I quote: “Operate in an open and financially stable manner, 
including improving citizen access, focusing on measurable results, improving the City’s 
financial position and eliminating accumulated deficits.” 

As much as we need a City of Flint Strategic Plan to guide future budgets, we also need 
to reform how we manage the City in a fundamental way. Previously I have called for 
reducing mayoral appointees and council and restructuring city functions to protect the 
general fund for public safety. This was about shrinking city hall but upon further 
reflection smaller by itself isn’t the solution. 

As I said, the State of the City is that Flint is smaller yet stronger and smarter. This is 
what we need in our governance too. Stronger and smarter. We need new proposals to 
ensure 5 year financial projections and accurate revenue estimates are used, not as a 
matter of choice but as a matter of law — in the charter and in our ordinances. I believe 
we need to protect the professionalism of top City officials in finance and administration 
so that once they are appointed they can do their jobs in the public interest. 

The Blue Ribbon Governance Committee, that myself and Councilman Nolden and 
other community members are participating in, will be making recommendations about 
how we can improve our governance. It is my hope that we will have charter 


32 



amendments on the ballot this year so we can prove that we are prepared to make 
lasting changes for the better. 

There are a number of members of the Blue Ribbon Governance Committee who are 
here. We are meeting about 2 times a month and will soon be organizing broader public 
input as we consider reform proposals. Would all of the members of the governance 
committee please stand and be recognized for your time and commitment. 

It was the Emergency Manager Darnell Earley who came up with the idea of the 
Governance Committee. I applaud his willingness to engage the community, and work 
with Council and me, to get us to transition as soon as possible. We are all more than 
ready to put these challenges to rest and move forward. Mr. Earley has a part to do. I 
have a part to do. Council President Kincaid has a part to do. Every Council person has 
a role. And so do you. 

Here at City Hall we must work together to check off items on the transition 
management plan as quickly as we can in a responsible manner. Strategic Plan. Five 
Year Forecast. 2 year budget. Get involved in this process. It is going to be a busy 3 
months here on the 3 rd Floor. 

I am prepared to lead the City back to home rule, i will need cooperation from the City 
Council and the Community. 

This is about going forward, not falling back. 

And yes, we will have to address a number of difficult financial challenges that are still 
before us. The FY15 budget will be challenging and with the current court order on 
health care reimbursements, the changes in personnel levels and services may not be 
over. The reality is that we need cost savings from health care in order to protect 
pensions and keep us on a path to solvency and stability. I call on all parties to work 
together. Collaboration is critical in order for us to be successful. 


33 



And we need citizens involved and informed. The next City Council Finance Committee 
meeting is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday March 12 th starting at 4:45pm. Attend if 
you can and let us know your ideas for our strategy and budget going forward. 

IV. Call to Action for Citizens & Partners 

Our new Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint came out of the Imagine Flint planning 
process. As the text in the plan states: Imagine Flint was, and I quote, “the result of 
thousands of people who dared to imagine a better Flint; who love their City so much, 
they took the time to come together to discuss their ideas, voice their fears and 
concerns, and share their dreams and aspirations. With the knowledge that there is 
much more work to be done and the willingness to do it, the people of Flint have 
imagined a better life that they themselves can help create.” 

This spirit of service and commitment to the common good is one of the distinguishing 
features of our community and indeed our country. We have proudly born our burdens 
as we worked for better solutions, often as volunteers, unpaid yet passionate. Consider 
all of the action steps we have touched on today, and this is only a fraction of the 
whole. I see a surge of service stepping up in Flint, there is an army assembling to work 
for change. This is an exciting time to be here and be part of this transformation. 

President John F. Kennedy may have said it best at his first inauguration in 1961 and 
his words apply to our Flint community as well as to the United States at large: “I do not 
believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other 
generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light 
our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And 
so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can 
do for your country.” 

And so my fellow Flintstones, now that you have heard the State of the City, now that 
you know about the key initiatives, now that you have been updated on the war on 


34 



blight, the fight against crime, our commitment to community schools, to jobs, to 
reforms... 

Do not first ask what your City can do for you 
First ask what you can do for Flint 
What wijl you do for Flint? 

We have a list of top ways to implement the master plan. We have a copy for everyone 
as you leave. Choose one. Get started. Love Your Block. Love Your City. Love Your 
Neighbor as Thyself. This starts with families, friends and neighbors taking care of each 
other. 

There is so much to do and so many ways to do it. 

We will be working with the American Red Cross to be better prepared and protected. 
March is Red Cross month. 

I will lead a Mayors Wellness Challenge this April starting with a community weigh in 
right here in City Hall and then doing activities like healthy cooking demonstrations, 
walks and exercise classes. 

We can all be part of the solution for assisting families truly struggling with their utility 
bills by using the new Flint income tax check off for Water Fund contributions that will go 
to the United Way. 

Information on all of these initiatives and more are featured in the Citizen Action Fair in 
the lobby on the first floor as you leave. 

We need you to help implement the master plan. 


35 



We need you to join the battle against blight. 


V. Conclusion 

Volunteers are force multipliers 
Collaboration is critical 

And all of this makes our investments go further, create more jobs, serve more families 

The end to our valley forge winter is inevitable. The snow will melt. A new season will 
come. The war is declared. The battle is in front of us. We are smaller, yet stronger and 
smarter. And in Flint, we never, ever, ever give up. 

May God bless you 

May God bless Flint 

Thank you

4) Financial Update 

a) Deficit Elimination Plan - S. Schafer found no accounting concerns. COF is 
intending to proceed along lines of DEP as we await formal approval. 

b) Approval of the budget amendment still pending - 4 weeks. Because of Water 
Treatment Plant update expense and timeline, we are proceeding as we await 
formal approval of the amendment. That is also important because the amendment 
maintains the $1 million in deficit reduction. 

c) Thanks to Treasury for assistance in moving Administrative Consent Order 
through the DEQ, however the process is still moving slowly. ACO is still not 
approved. 

d) Update on E&Y contract: held a phone conference with Treasury about 
Hurley, Water and Sewer study and their update of the 5 year financial 
projections.

7) Water Issues 

The Water Plant held a ceremonial ground-breaking for the update to the water 
treatment plant in preparation to transition to Flint River use as drinking water 
source. 

We will know by the first of next week the certainty of being on the river in April. 

We are currently in negotiations with GCDC on purchase of pipeline. COF is 
making counter-proposal on sale of pipeline (using $4million appraisal value). 
Need to know Treasury will approve sale using this appraisal.

The proposal also included an Asset Management Plan for the Wastewater 
Treatment Plant. The Plant's NPDES permit renewal will require this in the 
upcoming fiscal year. That AMP is estimated to cost $300,000, which will now 
have to be funded internally. 

4) City Council Update 

a) Schedule for Council review of two year budget established upon receipt of 
proposed budget on April 30. Council, working through its Finance Committee 
will meet between May 5 and May 17 to review budget. Council plans to hold 
public hearing on May 18 and to provide comments and recommendations to EM 
by May 28. 

b) Council held a Special Meeting on April 7 to take up the 7 Point Transition 
Management Plan which was postponed from the March 24 meeting. Plan was 
adopted on a 5-4 vote. 

c) The Public Works Committee met on Thursday April 10 to listen to a 
presentation on the Water and Sewer Rate Study results. Study recommends a rate 
increase and substantiates City’s decision to go with KWA. Only council 
members were allowed to ask questions. A public question and answer session 
will be held on Thursday April 17. Considerable public opposition is brewing to 
any rate increase. 

d) The next regular City Council meetings are scheduled for Wednesday, April 
30; Monday, May 19; Monday June 16, 2014.

6) Water Issues 

a) Water Issues - DEQ construction permits were received last week for the 
Water Treatment Plant and Bray Rd. site. Easement issues with Consumers 
Energy have been resolved. A series of meetings, media activities and other forms 
of notification about water change over are being planned. Start date goal: April 
17,2014. 


b) Negotiations with GCDC continue with regards to sale of the pipeline section. 
COF current proposal is for $3.9 million sale price, the value established in recent 
valuation. Valuation has been submitted and reviewed by Treasury. Submission to

7) Water Issues 

a) The City Council met twice to discuss the sale of a 9 mile section of 
unused pipeline to the GCDC. The City had negotiated a sale price of 
$3.9 million. Council first voted to reject the sale. A second meeting 
resulted in a vote to sell the pipe section for $3.9 million but receive the 
funds in two payments over two fiscal years. It is unknown if the City 
council made a submission of this proposal to the local emergency 
financial assistance loan board. Does Flint have Treasury’s approval to 
execute the contract of sale?

7) Water Issues 

a) The City Council met twice to discuss the sale of a 9 mile section of 
unused pipeline to the GCDC. The City had negotiated a sale price of 
$3.9 million. Council first voted to reject the sale. A second meeting 
resulted in a vote to sell the pipe section for $3.9 million but receive the 
funds in two payments over two fiscal years. It is unknown if the City 
council made a submission of this proposal to the local emergency 
financial assistance loan board. Does Flint have Treasury’s approval to 
execute the contract of sale?

Governor Snyder, 


The recent water concern in the City of Flint has revealed two actions for future drinking water 
shortages. 

In the past, the Flint area has used the National Guard water tanker for local road races. Also, daily 
water tankers fill our local swimming pools. 

When we have large numbers of citizens that must use the "Boil the Water" process, why can't we use 
the tankers I mentioned above? 

Flint has gone days without drinking water. 

With such a basic life need, let's try some possible solutions! We could dispense the water at Senior 
Centers, community gathering locations, neighborhood schools and churches. This could be seen as a 
training experience for the National Guard or Reserves. 

Governor, the need is there and the tankers are at hand. 

Thanks for your time and please let me know what you think. 

I hope this note finds you and your family in fine health. 



Genesee County Clerk 
John J. Gleason

important role to play. Working together as a team, the City of Flint has been successful in the 
pmvi.Qus qearteFiR increasing public safety, improving infrastructure, creating jobs and. 
development, eliminatin'.:; blight, engaging citizens arid managing financial and administrative 
dial ienges. Areas of success include:

water has been complicated by the system's aging infrastructure and varying t emperatures A 
badly needed Update to the City's web site is underway; progress has been delayed from initial

in a customer friendly and financially responsible manner. Near term steps for achieving this 
have further been defined by a set of priorities set by the Mayor and City Council as the biennial 



budget was adopted. Likewise, the Master Rian for a Sustainable Flint, adopted in October 2013 
by the Flint City Council and the Flint Planning Commission, provides the framework for ongoing 
efforts to improve the community as a whole. 

Achieving the outcomes desired will be a lengthy and ongoing process. Specific steps to move 
along this course have been outlined in a series of objectives to be accomplished over the next 
several years. The purpose of the quarterly report Is io hold the City of Flint government

Mdndg!n| : Financial £fc \lmgm 

Operating in a financially sustainable manner is essentiai if the City Is to achieve its Mission of 
. assuring that residents,.; businesses, students and visitors receive municipal services in. a 
customer fiien dly 3 nd financially responsible manner. Mi tie the City continues to address an 
accumulated Ge riefa'i Fanddefigit,. significant; legacy costs; and a continuing structural deficit, 
progress continues to be made; 

* The.Cenferal fu.nd defichcontloues to .bereduced, and the City's financial position is : 
stabilized at least for the: near term Preiiminary projections show the deficit as of June 
30,. 2014 to be sg million, a reduction from $*1.9 million the previous year. The City's 
cash position is adequate. 

* A plan to eliminate the General Fund deficit no later than FYrtg and to accumulate an 
adequate level of financial reserves no Igter than FY24 has been a pproved by the State. 

» Revenues and expenses for the first, quarter of FY15, which ended September 30, are 
generally in. tine., with expectations.. 

* The City is vigorously pursuing externa! funding and resource.;: to implement impo ft ant 
projects in areas such as blight elimination, housing, and pad; improvements. More 
than S3 million has been received so farthis year from federal agencies, state entities 
and community foundations, and additional applications are pending. 

However,, the legal challenge to changes made to retime health care as part of restoring 
financial sd|ye ncy conti hues. The June 30 decision by the Federal Co urtto p ermit the City to 
modify health care for retirees should provide some financial relief to the City while the case is 
being litigated. Should the City not prevail, however, the 55 million additional cost added to * he 
; F Yi5 budget will be continued, a nd may result m Flint’s retu tn to financial solvency becorni ng : 
exceedingly difficult if not; impossible 



Improving Internal Operations 


Achieving the goals setforth in the Strategic Plan will require a city organization that is efficient 
and effective, and capable of operating in an environment of limited resources. Elected leaders, 
appointed officials, and employees must be highly trained and professional, and place high 
priority on excellent customer service. Its organizational structures and process must be 
efficient, modem, and focused on results. Much remains to be done, but progress is being made: 


• The search for an experienced professional City Administrator is underway, and several 
charter amendments are being considered by the voters, which would further enhance 
the efficiency of the government. 

• A badly needed update to the City's web site is underway; progress has been delayed 
from initial completion targets as the selected vendor was unable to perform necessary 
tasks. 

• A comprehensive review of City Ordinances is underway, with revisions in business 
licensing and zoning ordinances nearly complete. 

• The organizational structure of the City has been revised to assure that capacity exists 
to implement the Master Plan. 

• Professional development opportunities have been defined and are being provided for 
city staff. Current focuses include supervision and use of technology. 

• An in-depth evaluation of the structure of the police and fire departments is underway 
with the goal of identifying the most efficient and effective structure for the delivery of 
public safety services. 

• Nearly all labor contracts and personnel policies have been revised to improved 
organizational efficiency while containing short and long term costs associated with 
employee compensation. 

• Review of the City's capacity to provide capacity and leadership in economic 
development is underway, including the potential of collaborative efforts with other 
entities. 

• Reorganization of current staff positions to enhance constituent services is underway. 

• Internal reorganizations and policy/procedure updates within the Police and Fire 
Departments have been enacted. 

• The City's Emergency Management Plan has been updated. 

• Reorganizations within the Utilities Division are being implemented to increase 
capacity to respond to maintenance and other needs. 

• The Transportation Division has increased its capacity and lowered its costs to perform 
right-of-way maintenance activities by assigning casual skilled laborto work with street 
Maintenance crews. 

• Agreement executed with Genesee County Conservation District to compile an 
inventory of street trees in order to develop a sustainable plan for the care and 
preservation of the urban street tree forestry. 

• Improved processes for grant administration and compliance monitoring are being 
implemented 

• Planning is leading an effort to fully utilize GIS capabilities to serve all departments. 



Asset management tools for Transportation a nd Utilities, such as GPS units,; web 
reporting, and .3 new work order system, are scheduled for installation in the coming 
months. 

* Acity wide program to recognize employees is being evaluated. Currently, recognition 
programs exist on a departmental basis, including the Police Department, and a new 
program is scheduled for introduction in Department of Public Works. 

» The Community arid Economic Development Division continues to enact corrective 
actio as,, refine and adopt policies and procedures and provide technics! assistance: to : : 
sub-redplents for federal and state funded programs that reduce the: potential 
repayment from historical HUD OiG monitoring findings and current Field Office and 
MS HDA mon itoriog, reducing exposure to General Fund for repayment. 


Transitiaoinq Back to Horne Buie 


The City has. beenyfiderthajufMtctfonpftfe cuns, as its 

financial condition . placed it on the brink of insolvency . Much progress has been made to address 
that, and the focus is now preparing for the transition back to Home Rule. Progress to date 
Includes; 


« A 7 Point. Plan enacted by the Emergency Manager identifies specific objectives to be 
accompl ished in orderfor the transit! gin to p rooted 
* Target completion dates have been identified for many of the steps 
» Specific objectives which have been accomplished include approval of a Deficit 
Elimination Plan, initiation of the search for a City Administrator, completion of a 
report by the Blue Ribbon Committee and the placement c;rf 5 Charier Amendments 
; plus the question of forming al Charter Review Commission on the November ballot. 


CcHiausfori 


P rog ress is being mad© in accordance withithe expectations of the Strategic Plan and its specific 
objectives. Significant steps are being taken to improve its financial condition and to restructure 
the organ! zation to improve eff iciancys.and .effectiveness; Steps are also being taken, to prepare, 
the City for return to traditional Horne Ride governance. 

Not surprisingly. because this is s first quarter -"sport, not all objectives have been completed, 
and some have yet to start. In addition, many of the objectives require significant amounts of 
fifo e and energy to a chieve 

The positive progress outlined in this report r ust be read in the context of the current overall 
condition of the City of flint. The level of services currently provided by the City is margins! as it: 
struggles to regain financial solvency. Flint continues to be challenged by population loss, 
relatively iovv per capita income, aging infrastructure, and an insufficient revenue stream to 
support a desired level of services. If still has a significant General F uhd deficit, to be a ddressed, : 
along with significant legacy costs. And it still faces the possibility of Insolvency should the

RE: City of Flint Quarterly Financial Report 

July 1, 2014 - September 30, 2014 


The City of Flint's Strategic Plan envisions a "well managed financially stable, and accountable 
government focused on creating and maintaining a vibrant and growing community which will attract 
and retain residents, businesses, students and visitors and improve our quality of life." 

Operating in a financially sustainable manner is a key component to achieving that vision. As part of this, 
a biennial budget has been adopted for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and a commitment has been made 
to a regular and ongoing review of revenues and expenses. To this end, a quarterly report on the status 
of the Cit/ s budget will be provided to the Finance Committee on an ongoing basis. 

Attached is a comparison of the City's budgeted revenues and expenses to actual revenues and 
expenses as of September 30, 2014, 

In summary, at the end of the 1 st quarter, the financial outlook for the remaining FY15 appears to be on 
track. In total, revenues and expenditures are generally meeting expectations. The City continues to 
make timely pension contributions and healthcare premium payment for both active employees and 
retirees. 

Some further observations on the current budget status: 

• in the General Fund, actual revenues are just above 20% of budgeted revenues. At the time of 
the report, however, the City had not received its portion of State Shared Revenues, and when 
those revenues are received {approximately $2.4 million), they will be accrued back to the 1 st 
quarter, 



General Fund expenditures are reported at 22% of the budgeted expenditures, in line with 
expectations. However, it has been discovered that $13,000 in communications expenses was 
inadvertently deleted from the District Court budget. It will be necessary to consider an 
adjustment to the District Court budget to address this shortfall. 

Also, we continue to monitor the personnel expenses in the Police and Fire budgets to 
determine the budgetary impact that reducing staffing levels through attrition rather than 
layoffs at the beginning of the year will have. It appears that attrition is moving staffing levels 
down to the budgeted levels, with Fire already at its reduced level of 75, and Police currently at 
121, with a target of 115. By the end of the second quarter we anticipate that the reduced levels 
will be met by then and in addition, we will have the results of the ICMA organizational and 
staffing study. We will also be beginning to receive a portion of the $1 million allocated for 
police and fire expenditures in the state budget. We presently anticipate that these funds will be 
sufficient to offset any shortfall in the personnel line items in these budgets. With the second 
quarter report, we will provide any necessary budget amendments in these areas. 

Special Revenue Funds, Major and Local Street Funds are operating below budgeted revenues 
and expenditures. Major Streets, Fund 202, revenues are down due to timing in which State 
revenues of the Gas and Weight Tax allocations have not been received as of the date of the 
report. Budgets in the Grant Funds, Funds 274, 295, and 296 reflect timing differences as well. 
The revenues in these funds have not been received as of the date of the report. In addition, it 
will be necessary to create a budget for Fund 297 to reflect the final expenditure of a COPS 
Hiring Grant, with funds carried over into the FY15 budget year. 

Revenues in the Building Safety and Inspections Fund (Fund 542) are coming in higher than 
anticipated for the first quarter of the year. This was due largely to the new construction of the 
paint shop on the General Motor's property expansion. 

Revenues in the Water and Sewer funds are coming in at 19% and 16% respectively in 
comparison to the budgeted totals. At the same time, expenditures are coming in a 13% and 
11% of the budgeted totals. It appears that the trend of reduced water billings are continuing, 
and efforts are underway to increase compliance and to identify areas of water loss from leaks 
as well as from theft. Actual expenditures currently do not include many of the capital 
improvement projects that are budgeted this fiscal year. The DPW and the Finance Department 
will continue to closely monitor the Utilities revenues and expenditures to keep them in line. 

The June 30, 2014 ruling by the Federal Court which modified its injunction to allow the City to 
implement certain changes to retiree health care benefits should provide some financial relief to 
the City budget, at least for the time during which the matter is being litigated. However, at this 
time it is not possible to project the amount of relief from the $5 million which was added to the 
budget for retiree health care as a result of the Courts initial decision prohibiting any change to 
retiree health care. This is because implementing the approved changes will not be effective 
until November 1 because of the time necessary to incorporate the changes into the current 
plans. With the second quarter report, we anticipate being able to project the anticipated costs 
in comparison to the budgeted amounts.

City of Flint Quarterly Update October 2014 
Fact Sheet.PDF 


The City of Flint recently presented a quarterly strategic plan and budget review to the City Council and the public for the 
period July 1 -September 30, 2014. We are pleased to report on the progress made despite the significant challenges and 
risks that remain. 


Overall, the City of Flint has a vision and a plan and now it is focused on implementation in order to achieve a stronger 
and financially sound municipal government along with a safer and more stable community. Working together as a team, 
the City of Flint has been successful in the previous quarter in increasing public safety, improving infrastructure, creating 
jobs and development, eliminating blight, engaging citizens and managing financial and administrative challenges. 


The quarterly strategic plan and budget review documents are available on the City’s website at www.cilvofflint.com and I 
encourage you to take a look and become informed on the City’s current condition. 


Areas of success noted in the quarterly report overview include: 

to Law enforcement is working hard with growing community support and total homicide victims is down 28% compared 
with 2013. 

to Utilities is managing with an eye toward the future and the construction of the KWA pipeline is underway, on time and 
within budget. 

to Development activities have increased with new facilities under construction at GM Flint Assembly, on the Buick City 
brownfield site with American Pipe, and downtown in the Health and Wellness District. 

tn Blighted properties continue to be eliminated, using state and federal funds, and neighborhood volunteer groups have 
removed more than 2 million pounds of trash in major cleanup efforts. 

to The General Fund deficit continues to be reduced, and the City’s financial position is stabilized at least for the near 
term. Preliminary projections show the deficit as of June 30, 2014 to be $9 million, a reduction from $12.9 million the 
previous year. 

to Revenues and expenses for the first quarter of FY1 5 are in line with expectations. 

to Internal restructuring of the City continues at it strives to become efficient, effective, and customer service focused in an 
environment much smaller than in the past. 


to The transition from state oversight to traditional home rule is underway, guided by the Seven Point Plan recently 
enacted. If progress continues as anticipated, the next step in transition will occur in 2015. 



Challenges also continue. The transition from DWSD to the Flint River for the City’s temporary supply of water until KWA 
is complete has occurred; however, the work of producing treated water has been complicated by the system’s aging 
infrastructure and varying temperatures. A badly needed update to the City’s web site is underway; progress has been 
delayed from initial completion targets as the selected vendor was unable to perform necessary tasks. The retiree lawsuit, 
whose outcome can seriously affect the financial solvency of the City, remains unresolved. Work continues to get done 
under difficult circumstances with limited resources, however the new strategic planning process is improving the City of 
Flint’s productivity, responsiveness and accountability. 


Another aspect of achieving the City’s vision and mission is in governance and administration. Six charter questions are 
on the November 4 th ballot that cover a charter commission, mayoral appointees, required offices, and the budget 
process. A fact sheet is attached so that you can be informed on the questions. 


The next quarterly update and budget amendment is expected in January 2015. Stay tuned for that and please contact 
me anytime with questions, suggestions or concerns.

FLINT BALLOT QUESTIONS 
FACT SHEET 


ELECTION DAY - NOVEMER 4, 2014 


On November 4, 2014, City of Flint voters will have an opportunity to decide on five charter 
amendment ballot questions, as well as whether to establish a charter review commission. The 
following is intended to provide basic information about these important issues. 

A. What questions are on the Ballot? 

There are six City of Flint Charter questions on the ballot, five charter amendment ballot questions, 
as well as whether to establish a charter review commission. The ballot language for each question 
is noted below. The ballot language is a summary of the proposed action that is approved by the 
State to ensure it is accurate and understandable. The actual change in the Charter is also provided 
for information purposes where applicable. 

A PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL REVISION OF THE FLINT CITY CHARTER 

Shall there be a general revision of the Flint City Charter? 

AN AMENDMENT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MAYORAL PRINCIPAL STAFF APPOINTMENTS 

Shall Flint City Charter §4-202(C) be amended to reduce the number of mayoral principal staff 
appointments from no more than ten (10) to no more than five (5)? 

AN AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE BUDGETARY BEST PRACTICES 

Shall Flint City Charter §7-101 be amended to provide that the annual budget presented to City 
Council be accompanied by a budget message explaining the budget, providing for multi-year 
financial plans and revenue projections, and the establishment of a Budget Stabilization Fund? 

AN AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE FLINT CITY CHARTER SECTION 4-203, EXECUTIVE 
DEPARTMENTS 

Shall Flint City Charter §4-203 be eliminated, which would eliminate the requirement for specific 
executive departments? 

AN AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION 

Shall Flint City Charter §5-101 through §5-205 be eliminated, which would eliminate the Civil 
Service Commission? 

AN AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN 

Shall Flint City Charter §3-501 through §3-517 be eliminated, which would eliminate the Office of 
the Ombudsman?

B. What is a Charter Review Commission? 

A charter review commission is established in order to consider changing the form of government. 
Often a charter review commission will propose substantial changes to the form of government 
with a total revision of the Charter. However, there is no requirement that they do so. 

The establishment of a charter review commission is a long-term process, which is defined by 
Michigan’s Home Rule City Act. (Act 279 of 1909, MCL 117.1, et seq.) The process entails 
several steps: 

a) First, voters must decide whether to establish a charter review commission. That is 
the decision Flint voters will make on November 4, 2014. 

b) If voters decide in favor of a charter review commission, then candidates for the charter 
review commission will have a period of time to submit nomination petitions. In this 
case, each candidate will need to submit a minimum of 246 valid signatures. 

c) A second election will be held to elect nine (9) members to the charter review 
commission. 

d) The charter review commission will then meet, analyze the Charter and, after an 
extensive period of careful study, either propose a new charter or take no action. 

e) If the charter review commission proposes a new charter, it is placed on the ballot for 
Flint voters to decide. Flint voters will have the right to accept or reject the proposed 
new charter. 

A charter review commission has independent authority to decide if any revisions to the Charter 
are necessary and, if so, what revisions should be made. 

C. What is a Charter Amendment? 

A charter amendment is a modification of an existing charter section. An amendment does not 
modify the form of government. Rather, an amendment addresses a needed change in a particular 
section of the charter. Even if all of the proposed amendments are approved by voters, the City of 
Flint will continue to have a strong mayor form of government, with the powers of the Mayor and 
City Council unchanged. The current Charter has been amended numerous times since 1974. 

D. How did these questions get on the Ballot? 

The ballot questions are the culmination of months of dedicated efforts by the Blue Ribbon 
Committee on Governance Reform, a research and study group composed of twenty-two members, 
more than 75% of whom are Flint residents including Mayor Dayne Walling and Councilman 
Bryant Nolden. These residents, like many in our community, are very concerned about the future 
of Flint. They carefully analyzed and debated Flint’s government, and considered various ways 
the Charter might be revised to allow the City to maintain fiscal stability and improve governance. 
The BRC concluded its mission by preparing a report which can be read at: www.citvofflint.com . 
The report includes numerous recommendations including, among other things, six ballot 
questions that were approved by the Emergency Manager to be placed on the ballot.

E. Additional Information 

On November 4, 2014, Flint voters will have a momentous opportunity to shape the future of their 
city. In determining whether the current City Charter should be revised, they have the power to 
set in motion changes to a governmental structure that has existed for forty years. Voters will also 
have the power to amend existing provisions of the Charter. These amendments, if adopted, would 
modify certain functions of government, but would not change the form of government. All of the 
proposed amendments would benefit the financial condition of Flint. With both a charter review 
commission and charter amendments, Flint voters face significant decisions about their 
government, and careful study and deliberation are warranted.

2. Amendment: Reduce Mayoral Executive Staff 

This amendment to subsection 4-202(C) proposes reducing the maximum number of mayoral 
principal staff appointments from ten (10) to five (5). If it passes, the Mayor will appoint fewer 
individuals as staff.

3. Amendment: Require Budgetary Best Practices 


This amendment to subsection 7-101 would require that the annual budget presented to City 
Council be accompanied by a budget message prepared by the Mayor. The budget message would 
explain the budget and provide for a multi-year financial plan and revenue projections. 

It would also establish a Budget Stabilization Fund. This fund would be created and added to from 
surpluses within the General Fund. It will be used as a “rainy day fund” for when the City faces 
future economic downturns, recessions, or financial difficulties. 


AN AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE BUDGETARY BEST PRACTICES 


Shall Flint City Charter §7-101 be amended to provide that the annual 
budget presented to City Council be accompanied by a budget message 
explaining the budget, providing for multi-year financial plans and 
revenue projections, and the establishment of a Budget Stabilization 
Fund? 

Yes 

No 


This charter amendment would add language to the Charter Sec. 7-101 BUDGET as follows. 

Sec. 7-101 BUDGET. 

Current: A. On or before the first (1st) Monday in April of each year, the Mayor shall submit to 
the City Council a proposed annual budget for the next fiscal year which shall begin on July 1 . 

Add: B. The Mayor’s message shall explain the budget both in fiscal terms and in tenns of the 
work programs, demonstrating how spending priorities are guided by and adherent to the City’s 
Master Plan. It shall outline the proposed financial policies of the City for the ensuing fiscal year 
and the impact of those policies on future years. It shall describe the important features of the 
budget, indicate any major changes from the current year in financial policies, expenditures, and 
revenues together with the reasons for such changes, summarize the City’s debt position, including 
factors affecting the ability to raise resources through debt issues, and include such other material 
as the Mayor deems desirable.

C. The budget shall provide a complete three (3) year financial plan of all City funds and activities, 
with five (5) years of revenue projections, and, except as required by law or this Charter, shall be 
in such form as the Mayor deems desirable or the City Council may require for effective 
management and an understanding of the relationship between the budget and the City’s strategic 
goals. The budget shall begin with a clear general summary of its contents; shall show in detail 
all estimated income, indicating the proposed property tax levy, and all proposed expenditures, 
including debt service, for the ensuing fiscal year; and shall be so arranged as to show comparative 
figures for actual and estimated income and expenditures of the current fiscal year and actual 
income and expenditures of the preceding fiscal year. It shall indicate in separate sections: 

1. The proposed goals and expenditures for current operations, detailed for each fund by 
department or by other organization unit, and program, purpose or activity, method of 
financing such expenditures, and methods to measure outcomes and performance related 
to the goals; 

2. Proposed longer-term goals and capital expenditures, detailed for each fund by department 
or by other organization unit when practical, the proposed method of financing each such 
capital expenditure, and methods to measure outcomes and performance related to the 
goals; and 

3. The proposed goals, anticipated income and expense, profit and loss for each utility or 
other enterprise fund or internal service fund operated by the City, and methods to measure 
outcomes and performance related to the goals. For any fund, the total of proposed 
expenditures shall not exceed the total of estimated income plus carried forward fund 
balance exclusive of reserves. 

D. The City shall establish a budget stabilization fund which shall be separate and distinct from 
the City’s general fund. Appropriations to the fund and expenditures from the fund shall be made 
in compliance with Act 30, Public Acts of Michigan of 1978, as amended, being MCL 141 .441 et 
seq.

4. Amendment: Eliminate Executive 
Department Requirements 


Currently, the City Charter Sec 4-203 requires the City to create specific executive departments 
with department heads appointed by the Mayor “to administer the responsibilities of the City for 
public safety, public works, utilities, parks and recreation, transportation including aviation, 
finance, community development, and environmental protection.” The proposed amendment 
would eliminate this requirement and in the future, executive departments will be created and 
reorganized by ordinance, when necessary, pursuant to City policy.

Shall Flint City Charter §4-203 be eliminated, which would eliminate the 
requirement for specific executive departments? 

Yes 

No

5. Amendment: Eliminate Civil Service Commission 


This amendment would eliminate the Civil Service Commission. Under the current City Charter, 
the Civil Service Commission provides oversight to the personnel administration of the City 
through a separate staff. The Commission must be staffed at all times, even during periods of 
financial stress. Eliminating the Civil Service Commission and addressing its functions through 
an ordinance would grant the City flexibility to change as City policy is shaped. In addition, 
eliminating the Civil Service Commission will save the City an estimated $187,643 annually. 


AN AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION 


Shall Flint City Charter §5-101 through §5-205 be eliminated, which 
would eliminate the Civil Service Commission? 

Yes 

No

6. Amendment: Eliminate Ombudsman Office 

This amendment would eliminate the Office of the Ombudsman from the City Charter. Under the 
Charter, the Office investigates grievances against City agencies. Currently, the Ombudsman’s 
Office must be staffed at all times, even during periods of financial stress. Eliminating the 
Ombudsman will save the City an estimated $635,780 in each adopted two-year budget. 
Eliminating the Ombudsman and addressing its functions through an ordinance would grant the 
City flexibility to change as City policy is shaped. 


AN AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN 


Shall Flint City Charter §3-501 through §3-517 be eliminated, which 
would eliminate the Office of the Ombudsman? 

Yes 

No

For Immediate Release 

City of Flint Ann ounces New Timeline for Charter Review Commission Election 

Flint, Michigan - November 10, 2014 - Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley issued the following 
statement this morning: 

“Flint City Attorney Peter Bade and outside counsel have had further discussions with election 
law experts regarding the timing of the charter review commission election. Based on changes in 
Michigan election law that became effective in 2014, it has been concluded there is insufficient 
time to submit this matter to the electorate in February, 2015, and achieve the best possible 
outcomes. Accordingly, the charter review commission election will be scheduled in May, 2015. 
This will afford Flint residents additional time to consider this important matter and, for those 
interested in serving on the commission, more time to gather petition signatures.” 

The date of the May election and the deadline for submission of nomination petitions will be 
announced shortly. 

Earley further stated, “We want to get this right and provide the citizens of Flint every opportunity be a 
part of this civic engagement process. The extra time to pull together all of the components of such an 
effort should assure a relatively smooth process and produce some candidates ready to roll up their 
sleeves and delve into this veiy critical exercise in governance and public policy.”

Understanding trends in state revenue sharing with 
local governments in Michigan 

by Martin Lavelle, business economist 


wet I as 


Over the past few years, discretionary cutbacks in state revenue sharing, as w 
other related fiscal and economic factors, have led to budgetary challenges for local 
governments across the country, including those in Michigan. To study this issue in depth, 
the author looks at trends in revenue sharing between state and local governments in 
Michigan since the early 2000s. 



Starting in January 2015, 
Chicago Fed Letter will be 
printed on an occasional basis

more frequently online. To sign

This Chicago Fed Letter examines die 
general role of state revenue sharing in 
local governments’ budgets by focusing 
on the case of Michigan. Many observers 
have asserted that: a major contributor 
to the financial difficulties of local 
governments in Michigan has been the 
significant drop in revenue sharing funds 
from the state government. To study 
this assertion, I examine the roots of 
the fiscal problems facing Michigan’s 
local governments in recent years and 
the ways in which these governments 
have been dealing with diminished tax 
revenue bases. 

Michigan’s local governments began to 
experience fiscal stress about a decade 
ago, when the state economy started to 
perform poorly. More recently, the finan- 
cial conditions of many local governments 
in Michigan continued to deteriorate 
even as the state government saw sur- 
pluses following the Great Recession. 
Gonsequendy, multiple units of local 
government — including the City of 
Detroit, the Detroit Public Schools, and 
the City of Flint — have been under the 
authority of suite-appointed emergency 
managers (EMs), who have the task, of 
returning these public entities to fiscal 
solvency. If an EM determines that fiscal 
solvency cannot be regained through 
cost-cutting, die selling of assets, and 


negotiations with creditors, drat EM 
can ask for state approval to take the 
public entity into bankruptcy proceed- 
ings, which is what happened with the 
City of Detroit. 1 

Current trends 

Revenue sharing programs can come 
under stress when economic activity 
slows, putting state budgets under 
pressure, which may in turn lead to 
decreases in revenue sharing with local 
governments. 2 To a large extent, declin- 
ing revenue sharing in Michigan has 
been due to die state’s weak economy. 
Michigan suffered a one-state recession, 
which began in late 2003 and lasted 
until mid-2009, when the nation’s Great 
Recession also concluded. During die 
one-state recession, Michigan experi- 
enced decreases in its own-source reve- 
nues and population, which ultimately 
resulted in declining state revenue shar- 
ing with local governments. As seen in 
figure 1, since 2002, local governments 
in Michigan have generally received 
fewer revenue sharing funds from the 
state with each passing year. 

The long decline in state funds available 
for revenue sharing with localities can 
best be understood by examining indi- 
cators of Michigan’s economy. The 2010 
U.S. Census revealed that Michigan was

the only state to lose population during 
the period 2000-10. 3 The population 
loss was brought on by a sharply declin- 
ing job base and a jump in unemploy- 
ment Meanwhile, Michigan’s residential 
real estate sector suffered a severe down- 
turn. Michigan is not commonly identi- 
fied with the mid-2000s housing price 
bubble. However, Michigan’s drop in 
housing market activity during that time 
was comparable to what happened in 
those places that were hardest hit by the 
housing crisis. Today, new home con- 
struction in Michigan remains around 
67% below its long-term trend — twice 
the gap that; exists between overall U.S. 
new home construction and its long-term 
trend. 4 And with, home prices having 
decreased sharply statewide over the 
2006-12 period, 6 taxable home values are 
down significantly. Amid all these diffi- 
culties, retail sales on an annual basis 
were lower in 2009-10 than in 2002-08, 
which meant that the state had fewer 
sales tax collections — the primary basis 
of the state’s revenue sharing program. 6 

As evident in figure 1, the state’s reve- 
nue sharing with local governments in 
Michigan is composed of two parts: a 
portion that is determined by the for- 
mula set forth in the state constitution 
and a portion that is based on tire for- 
mula set by the state statutory program 
in place at the time. Since 2002, reve- 
nue sharing funds as mandated in the 


state constitution have been fairly fiat, 
while such funds from the statutory 
program have fallen sharply. 

In Michigan, constitutionally mandated 
state revenue sharing with local gov- 
ernments began with the passage of an 
amendment to the state constitution in 
1946; 7 under article IX, section 10 of the 
Michigan Constitution, die state gov- 
ernment must share sales tax revenue 
with local governments. 8 In 1963, die 
amendment was modified to apportion 
15% of he 4% statewide sales tax reve- 
nue to local governments on a per cap- 
ita basis. 9 A locality’s population count, 
is determined by the U.S. Census Bureau 
and adjusted by subtracting 50% of die 
number of patients, wards, and convicts 
confined to public-tax-supported insti- 
tutions within its borders.’ 0 . Although 
certain individual units of local govern- 
ment might have gotten fewer funds 
from die state under this formulation 
in recent years, the overall levels of 
constitutionally mandated state revenue 
sharing have stayed fairly consistent 
over the past. 13 years. 

hi contrast, there has been a dear trend 
in falling statutory revenue sharing. 
This pattern can be traced back to the 
early part of the last decade, when the 
State of Michigan started to face signif- 
icant budgetary pressures. From then 
on, the state addressed its own fiscal 


problems partly through deep cuts to 
the existing statutory revenue sharing- 
program. Over die period 1999-2010, 
statutory revenue sharing amounts were 
distributed according to a formula 
that was based generally on taxable 
home value per capita and population.” 
Hence, those communities most, adversely 
affected by economic travails (i.e., those 
that were already experiencing dramatic 
home value declines and population 
flight) tended to have their fiscal stress 
magnified by the erosion of state revenue 
sharing funds under this distribution 
formula. Shortly after Governor Rick 
Snyder took office in 201 1, the Economic. 
Vitality Incentive Program (EVIP) became 
Michigan’s statutory revenue sharing- 
program. Local governments that re- 
ceived revenue sharing funds through 
die EVIP got significantly less than what 
they would have under the previous 
statutory revenue formula (e.g., in 2012 
and 2013, local, governments received a 
combined $173.5 million less dian they 
would have). 12 For fiscal year 2015, the 
City?, Village, and Township Revenue 
Sharing (CVTRS) program has replaced 
die EVIP. 15 Like die EVIP, the CVTRS 
program is likely to fall short of fully 
restoring statutory'- revenue sharing 
funds to levels before Michigan’s one- 
state recession (see figure 1). Given 
these policy changes, it is easy to see 
why state revenue sharing in Michigan

Conclusion 

While economic downturns clearly put. 
pressure on state and local governments 
alike, in Michigan’s case they have also 
added volatility and uncertainty into the 
revenue relationships between state, arid 
local governments. Because of changes to 
Michigan’s statutory revenue sharing 


There is a wider context, for understanding 
tire impact of Michigan’s declining state 
revenue sharing with localities since the 
early 2000s. In 1994, the state imposed 
a 2 percentage point, increase in its sales 
tax (from 4% to 6%) to help fund a 
much-expanded local school aid system 
(as mandated by Proposal. A, which I 
discuss in more detail later). 14 And so, 
for most of tire 1990s and early 2000s, 
local governments in Michigan became 
more dependent on state revenue sharing 
than those in most other states — -and. this 
relatively high state dependence remains 
in place today. As seen in panel A of 
figure 3, among communities of states 
in the Seventh. Federal Reserve District,’ 5 
local governments in Michigan are the 
most, reliant on state funding (with 43.3% 
of heir budgets funded by the state); 
among all U.S. communities, Michigan 
localities rank, fifth in his regard (see 
panel B of figure 3) . In fiscal year 2012, 
state revenue sharing with local govern- 
ments represented almost, three-fifths 
(nearly $15 billion) of all state spending 
from state resources. 16 Figure 2 shows 
that he percentage of state resources 
dedicated to intergovernmental revenue 
sharing has fallen since the beginning 
of Michigan’s one-state recession, but 
Iras remained above its constitutional 
mandate (of 48. 97%). 17 

Local fiscal ability 

Michigan’s economic collapse during 
he past decade also directly impacted 


Constitution explicitly forbids the use 
of some alternative revenue sources for 
local governments in Michigan that 
are employed in other states: Local 
governments ar e limited in their local 
income tax options; they may not insti- 
tute taxes such as sales or motor fuel 
taxes; and their use of the local prop- 
erty tax is tightly constrained. 18 The 
vast majority of states place some limi- 
tations on tire local property tax, but 
Michigan is among the very few with, 
all four types of limitations (revenue, 
levy, rate, and assessment limits).’ 9 More 
specifically, local property and other 
local taxes may not be raised without 
local voter approval. 20 If Michigan's 
property tax revenue base is broadened, 
property tax rates must decrease. If 
property values (excluding those for 
new construction and improvements) 
increase at a rate greater than infla- 
tion, property tax rates must, be adjust- 
ed in order to maintain he same gross 
revenue (changing strictly in line with 
inflation alone). 2 ’ However, property 
tax rates are allowed to drop at a rate 
greater than the inflation rate. 22 

A related feature currently putting addi- 
tional fiscal stress on local governments 
is the manner in which Michigan schools 
are funded. Michigan schools’ operating 
expenditures are funded primarily 
through state tax revenues as a result 
of the passage of Proposal A in I994. 2 ® 
While his program shifts the responsi- 
bility for funding education (equitably 


program and tax code, local government 
officials have become increasingly un- 
certain hat statutory revenue sharing trill 
reach pre-2003 levels. Local governments 
in Michigan may be forced to adjust what 
heir services programs can deliver be- 
cause of expected lower amounts of state 
aid over the medium term and possibly 
the long term. Meanwhile, Michigan 
localities’ latitude to maintain heir own 
programs with heir own revenue sources 
is seemingly limited by law.

Demo Request of MSHDA: Flint Eligibility Status 


Nov. 26, 2014 


Last October, the City of Flint adopted its first Master Plan since 1960. On the heels of the adoption, the City 
began development of a blight elimination framework, which prioritizes blight elimination activities based upon 
the new land use or "place types" in the Master Plan. This framework has gotten widespread community 
support with the goal of eliminating blight within the City in five years. Businesses, institutions, and residents 
are already pledging their support to help eliminate blight whether it is vacant lot maintenance or residential 
rehabilitation. Still the largest cost continues to be demolition and will require significant governmental 
resources. 

Given the significant challenges Flint faces due to extreme population loss over several decades, we are 
requesting that the City is considered for additional MSHDA resources for demolition. Even after the 
Hardest Hit Fund and Michigan Blight Elimination Grant are expended completing a total of 2,037 demolitions, 
the City will have an additional 6,000 properties in need of demolition. Of these properties, 1610 properties will 
come to the Land Bank on January 1 , 201 5 (see map of properties attached). We are also working on code 
enforcement of privately held properties in need of demolition, which tend to impact our "tipping point" 
neighborhoods more dramatically. As we work through the code enforcement process, these properties are 
increasingly being transferred to the Land Bank. Thus, the 1610 properties in need of demolition will go up. 














Demolition Update for Flint, Michigan - November 2014 


Flint’ s current administrative capacity and its data-driven blight elimination strategy leave it opportunistically poised for 
continuing to successfully removing blight through demolition. 

The City of Flint and the Genesee County Land Bank (GCLBA) have led demolition in Flint over the last ten years 
through a strong partnership. Together, the two demolished more than 4,000 blighted structures in Flint through the year 
2013. Over the last eighteen months this capacity for administering demolition has greatly increased. The GCLBA is 
successfully administering $26.41 million of funding for demolition in Flint, which will remove more than 2,000 blighted 
structures in record time. 


In 2014 the City of Flint released Beyond Blight: City of Flint Comprehensive Blight Elimination Framework. This data- 
driven Framework quantifies the scale of blight in Flint today, identifies roles and responsibilities for a collaborative 
approach, and provides priorities and strategies for eliminating blight in Flint in alignment with the City’s new Master 
Plan. The Framework includes a five-year demolition strategy. The Framework and its demolition strategy have been 
touted as models for approaching and prioritizing blight elimination broadly, and demolition specifically.

Demolition in Hardest Hit Fund Areas 

• Demolition in the Hardest Hit Fund areas aligns with the top priorities of Flint's Blight Elimination Framework. 
These areas comprise a subset of the Tier 1 areas in the table above. More specifically, Hardest Hit Fund areas 
include Neighborhood Centers, the vast majority of Traditional Neighborhoods, Green Neighborhoods with 
greater occupancy, the majority of Mixed Residential areas, the University Avenue Core, and the majority of City 
Corridors. 

• Given the recent large investment in the Hardest Hit Fund areas, remaining blighted structures in these areas 
are the first priority for demolition. 

o $30,720,000 needed to remove all blighted structures in Hardest Hit Fund areas. 

o $8,860,000 needed to demolish 662 (606 residential and 56 commercial) remaining blighted Land Bank 
structures in the Hardest Hit Fund areas, including structures the Land Bank will receive on January 1, 
2015. 

o $21,850,000 needed to demolish 1,653 (1,520 residential and 133 commercial) remaining blighted 
structures, privately owned, in the Hardest Hit Fund areas.

Beyond Blight: City of Flint Comprehensive Blight Elimination Framework , October 2014 


37 



Demolition of blighted and dangerous properties within Flint neighborhoods was identified as a top 
priority during Master Plan community engagement input sessions. In 2013 the Genesee County 
Land Bank Authority received two grants totaling roughly $23.8 million to demolish blighted 
residential and commercial structures, the vast majority of which are located in Flint. Accordingly, 
roughly 1,600 blighted structures will be demolished between the fall of 2013 and the spring of 
2015, according to the guidelines and requirements of the two funding sources. Because the 
demolition of these properties is funded and under way they are not included in the calculation of 
needed demolition and are considered demolished moving forward in this framework. There are 
still approximately 5,028 houses and 432 commercial buildings that will need to be demolished 
over the next five years at a cost of roughly $71.88 million. Additional expected funding for 
demolition over the next five years totals only $2.5 million ($500,000 of City of Flint CDBG funding 
annually), leaving a $69.38 million gap for demolition. Thus, pursuing funding for demolition is a 
top priority for the next five years. Demolition accounts for 66% of the total cost of removing blight 
over the next five years. Furthermore, although government agencies will typically take the lead on 
demolition, partnerships between government and institutions should be created and solidified for 
a complementary demolition approach. 


Collaboration Between Partners 



Residents 

Residents should support demolition by reporting both properties in need of demolition and 
improperly completed demolition projects to local government. 

Local Government 

Because the vast majority of demolition in Flint is needed for blight removal and not 
redevelopment, government will lead demolition throughout the city. 

Institutions 

Institutions such as non-profit organizations, churches, and places of learning and higher 
education and should support demolition by purchasing and demolishing nearby blighted 
properties in coordination with government agencies. 

Community Groups 

Residents should support demolition by reporting both properties in need of demolition and 
improperly completed demolition projects to local government. Community groups should 
also share information about demolition efforts with other community members. 

Businesses and Developers 

Like institutions, businesses and developers can support demolition by purchasing and 
demolishing nearby blighted properties. While businesses and developers will lead 
demolition for redevelopment purposes, government will likely support demolition for 
redevelopment given property values and market conditions in Flint.

Action Steps and Potential Strategies 

• Actively pursue funding for demolition to fill the gap between funding needed to demolish blighted structures over 
the next five years and funding currently available. 

• Develop demolition plans in line with the priority chart and place type descriptions provided in this framework. 

• Prioritize demolition within place types according to block-level occupancy. Prioritize demolishing blighted 
structures on blocks with higher occupancy. See vacancy by block maps for Traditional Neighborhoods on page 62 
and Green Neighborhoods on page 66. 

• Review and revise demolition infill specifications to reduce future maintenance and infrastructure costs. 

• Refrain from boarding vacant properties planned and funded for demolition. Board vacant properties identified for 
demolition but not funded. 

• Ensure collaboration between local government and University Avenue Core institutions. The demolition recently 
completed by the institutions in the University Ave Core is a leading example of a cross-sector demolition 
partnership. 93 properties are in need of demolition in this place type: 91 residential and 2 commercial structures 
costing approximately $1 ,01 0,000 total. Plans should be developed with University Avenue Core institutions to 
complete this demolition over the next five years. 

• Direct any deconstruction projects to Green Innovation sites to precede Green Innovation pilot projects. 

• Incorporate demolition into an online Problem Property portal (see page X for more details). Consider creating an 
online demolition-tracking tool. 

• Consider establishing a matching fund for demolition whereby private parties (residents, businesses, community 
organizations, institutions, etc.) can contribute money towards demolition in a particular place type that will be 
matched by one or more local foundations. Consider a specific request to homeowners in Traditional 
Neighborhoods. If each homeowner in Traditional Neighborhoods contributed $300 to a matching fund, all 
residential structures in need of demolition could be demolished in Traditional Neighborhoods.

From: Michael K. Brown, Emergency Manager, City of Flint 
Subject: CLOSING MEMORANDUM 


It has been a pleasure for me to serve the citizens of Flint for the past twenty-two months and I 
thank you for the opportunity to serve as Emergency Manager. 

I have worked hard to begin a cultural change to both improve the approach to city government’s 
interaction with citizens and to encourage a wider range of citizen participation. It is important to 
me that the next generation of leaders (I have called them emerging leaders) not be from the 
same mold as the old leaders and have the opportunity to assume positions of responsibility as 
we set a path to the future for Flint. A significant number of my leadership team is comprised of 
Flint residents who are committed to the future of their city. While this approach has meant that 
some things may have taken longer to achieve than it might otherwise take, it has been with the 
realization that changing the culture of City Hall is imperative if history is not to repeat itself. 

I have also tried to champion citizen participation throughout my tenure as Emergency Manager. 
Collectively, hundreds of people have been involved: in the Advisory Teams for Public Safety, 
Infrastructure, Financial, and Legacy issues which I established in January 2012; in the nine ward 
public meetings held in February-March 2012; in the Police and Fire Protection miliage campaign 
in Fall 2012; and in the Master Planning process which has involved citizen participation in 
numerous meetings held throughout the City over the past year. I have attached a list of some of 
these individuals who have worked on my advisory groups and the miliage team . 

As our regularly submitted reports to the Department of Treasury have documented, we have 
made substantial progress in putting the city on a path to solvency and resolving the financial 
emergency. Many achievements are detailed in the latest Financial and Operating Report which 
was submitted to the Department of Treasury on June 30, 201 3. Significant achievements over 
the past twenty-two months include: 


A. Financial 

1. Developing, adopting and operating with a balanced budget for FY13 - the 
first time in seven years that the City of Flint has lived within a balanced 
budget. 

2. Significantly improving the City’s cash flow - More than $40 million in cash on 
hand as of September 2, 2013 is significantly better than the approximate 
$10 million on hand in December 2011. The $10 million in cash at that time 
was due primarily to an $8 million loan from the state in the form of Fiscal 
Stabilization Bonds. 

3. Significantly reducing Other Post Employment Benefits (QPEB1 liabilities by 
more than $500 million - a 60% reduction. Not only have we significantly 
reduced legacy costs by more than 60%, we also have a plan for further 
reducing legacy costs, as detailed in recent presentations to the Department 
of Treasury 



4. Significantly reducing pension administration costs and improving investment 
returns by moving administration of the City’s pension fund to the Municipal 
Employees Retirement Fund, while also changing the structure of future 
pension benefits which will reduce future pension liabilities 

5. Developing a plan for and implementing a reduction in the City’s $19.1 miliion 
deficit ahead of schedule . At the end of FY12, we presented a plan to the 
State Treasurer for eliminating the $19.1 million deficit within 5 years. Based 
on preliminary year end results for FY13, we are ahead of the scheduled 
reduction since it appears that FY 13 will end with a surplus of revenues over 
expenses by approximately $3 million. This will likely reduce the $19.1 million 
deficit to the $16 million range. Had the Department of Treasury authorized 
the borrowing of $12 million as contained in the approved FY12 Deficit 
Elimination Plan, the remaining deficit would now be closer to $4 million. 

6. Developing a five year financial projection which maps out the continuing 
financial challenges Flint will face, regardless of who is in charge. With FY 14 
balanced and adopted, development of the FY15 budget -which will without 
doubt be the most challenging of the next few years - is underway. In the 
process of developing the multi-year projection, it has also become clear that 
the path for Flint's financial solvency will require additional sources of 
revenue in addition to further reductions in legacy costs. We have identified a 
path for further reductions in legacy costs, and we have also identified an 
increase in the local income tax as the most promising and realistic source of 
new revenue. Unfortunately the Treasurer has not supported that initiative. 

7. Stabilizing Police and Fire Protection revenue . Since being appointed in 

201 1 , it has been clear that the stabilization and enhancement of public 
safety is the top priority in the City of Flint. Many steps have been taken to 
achieve this, including securing voter approval of a 6 mill property tax 
increase by a margin of 57% to 43%. Additionally, by ordinance the City must 
now appropriate no less than 55.5% of General Fund revenues for Police 
and Fire budgets. The FY 14 budget dedicates more than 60% of General 
Fund revenues to these purposes, and exceeds 80% when 9-1-1 and District 
Court funding is included. As a result, staffing for police and fire personnel 
was maintained at current levels in spite of the significant staffing reductions 
necessary to balance both the FY13 and FY14 budgets. Unfortunately, 
without a new source of revenue in FY1 5, it is unlikely that can continue. 

8. Resolving Federal Government liabilities - More than $7 million in questioned 
grant costs prior to the EM’s appointment in December 201 1 have been 
resolved - as documented by the OIG report and HUD findings. 

9. Reorganizing City operations - The City workforce has been reduced by 
more than 25% as the City has faced its financial challenges. Doing so while 
still providing for the delivery of city services has required restructuring work 
processes and organizational alignments, as well as the increased use of 
technology. These changes have been made in the context of a newly 
developed strategic plan which identifies the key functions and objectives of 
the City. 

B. Public Safety 

1 . Opening of the Flint Lock-up . The lock-up opened the week of October 1 , 

2012. Public Safety Director Lock recommended selection of the Genesee 
County Sheriff as the operator of the Flint lock-up. Lock also recommended 
that the lock-up be made available to all policing agencies operating within 


2 



Genesee County for warrants and fresh charges, both felony and 
misdemeanor. Well over one thousand outstanding warrants are being 
cleared each month. This funding by the State has been very much 
appreciated and very beneficial to the City. 

2. Creating the Criminal Justice System Advisory Council chaired by Chief 
Judge Richard Yuille. In September 201 2 the first meeting of the Criminal 
Justice System Advisory Council (CJSAC) was held. Eight workgroups were 
established. Through these work groups a number of cooperative projects, 
streamlined operations and new collaborations have been identified and 
numerous projects continue to move forward. 

3. Completing the transition to 800 MHz public safety communications system. 
Ail Public Safety departments were operational on the 800 MHz 
communications system in December of 2012. Flint Public Safety is now 
compatible with the communications system used throughout Genesee 
County and with the Michigan State Police. 

4. Securing public safety grants totaling over $1 1 million (not including State 
funded Lock-up). A $6.9 million SAFER grant to employ thirty-nine firefighters 
for two years was received in May 2012. The Mott Foundation has granted 
the City over $1 .8 million for several public safety initiatives. The Treasurer’s 
Office through the C-GAP funding awarded the City $1 .8 million to construct 
a 9-1-1 simulcast communications tower in April 2013. Homeland Security 
awarded Flint a total of $61 5,000 for 9-1-1 console upgrades and purchase 
of new radios for the 800 MHZ transition. 

5. Up-grading Police Department technology to improve data-driven decision 
making and capability for overall communications with Law Enforcement 
agencies at all levels of government. The Mott Foundation funded MSU 
Training & Technical Assistance Team conducted a technology audit which 
provided a road map of upgrades necessary to ensure that officers and 
firefighters can take maximum advantage of the tools already provided to 
them. New World Systems, Flint’s records management system, required 
server and switch upgrades before the New World update could be made. 
Each of these components has now been completed and the use of the full 
feature set of New World is being implemented throughout the FPD. 

6. Implementing 12 hour shifts for Police Patrol Officers which put more officers 
on the street and vastly reduced overtime in the department. 

7. Taking major steps toward the reconsolidation of the Flint City 9-1-1 with the 
Genesee County 9-1-1 consortium. The C-GAP grant to build the 
communications tower will enhance system coverage for the entire County. 

8. Improving Public Safety Response Recently compiled statistics for FBI Part 
One violent crimes show significant improvements have resulted from the 
implementation of many public safety initiatives. Overall violent crime is down 
an average of 24% in the first six months of 2013 vs. the first six months of 
2012 . 


C. Infrastructure (this area includes water and sewer, waste collection, roads and 
streets, bridges, parks, facilities as well as commercial and residential demolition 
targets and blight in general) 


3 



1 . Stabilizing funding for water and sewer systems . This enterprise fund 
plunged from a $60 million dollar positive balance in 2007 to a $23M deficit in 
2012. By raising water and sewer rates more than 25%, reorganizations and 
improving technologies we have been able to stop the bleeding and stabilize 
funding for the long term. 

2. Significantly improving the process and cost of providing the Flint and 
Genesee County region with water by joining the KWA. Working with the 
County Drain Commissioner and others, we have begun this long awaited 
KWA project, which will result in several hundred million dollars in cost 
decreases to residents and businesses. I want to acknowledge former 
Emergency Financial Manager Edward Kurtz for his work and detailed 
analysis which brought this complicated process to a decision point. 

3. Reducing costs for Waste Collection and implementing Recycling . By moving 
to a fee for service and contracting with the private sector waste collection 
vendor, we eliminated a General Fund subsidy of more than $1 million 
annually, and for the first time ever we are able to offer city-wide curbside 
recycling. 

4. Finalizing the Smith Village construction project . This housing development 
project has languished for over ten years, important deadlines were ignored 
and Flint was in serious difficulty with HUD. Ed Kurtz cleaned up this tangled 
project, changed developers, and moved this project significantly toward its 
final steps. Thirty-six residences have been completed, seven have been 
sold and ten purchase agreements are in process. 

5. Updating of City's 50 year old Master Plan Mayor Walling and Chief Planner 
Megan Hunter have coordinated a city-wide, tremendously inclusive planning 
effort. Hundreds of Flint citizens have worked on sub-committees, attended 
visioning sessions and worked hard to develop a plan for a revitalized Flint. 

6. Reducing overtime costs in the Utilities division , by implementing new 
technology and reorganizations. Examples include planned elimination of the 
solid waste incinerator and electronic monitoring of the Third Ave. Pumping 
Station. 

7. Disposing of unused inventory and facilities . Auctions have been used to 
eliminate surplus equipment and vehicles while city facilities which are no 
longer required and which we can not afford to operate are being sold or 
leased. 

8. Contracting management of city golf courses and Senior Centers in order to 
reduce city costs and still provide access to residents. 

Achieving this level of success in twenty-two months has been extremely challenging. Obstacles 
have arisen from many sources. The team in Flint has taken on each challenge and worked with 
a single-mindedness to keep Flint on the path to sustainability. We firmly believe that with 
continued effort, Flint City government can once again become a financially stable organization 
capable of delivering quality municipal services to it residents, businesses, and visitors. This route 
will involve continued cost reductions, investments in technology and personnel, and additional 
sources of revenues. The alternative of bankruptcy is not the right path - it is expensive, time 
consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. 

There are several major issues which are currently on the horizon. The shortage of revenue to 
balance the FY15 Budget is the primary issue. Public Safety staffing is still at unacceptably low 


4 



levels and with current financial conditions it is likely that the number of police officers and 
firefighters will be reduced in order to achieve a balanced budget. This likelihood is enhanced by 
the pending expiration of the FEMA SAFER grant which supports the wages and benefits of 39 
firefighters. 

Blight is an on-going major issue in Flint. We have few resources and blight issues range from 
unmowed to demolition necessary properties. Flint recently received $20 million in Federal 
"Hardest Hit" funds to demolish approximately 1600 residences, yet we have 20,000 abandoned 
homes and hundreds of vacant commercial properties. 

There has been disagreement within the community regarding the appointment of an Emergency 
Manager, about the difficult choices which were made to impose higher water and sewer rates, 
street lighting assessment and waste collection fees, and about other decisions. Yet, there has 
been no civil unrest, as threatened by a few voices. There was significant support to increase 
property taxes in an economically distressed city, because voters saw that this was the right 
choice for Flint. 

With the changes of the magnitude needed to address Flint’s conditions, there is no doubt 
controversy, disagreement, and anger can result. Often, the most vocal represent the fewest 
number. I have worked with many in the City of Flint who understand the severity of our condition 
and the scope of effort necessary to address it. If you have questions about the support given for 
the direction I have taken to restore Flint to financial solvency, i offer the names of the following

I have been a member of the Flint community for over thirty-five years. I grew up on the North 
End in one of the few integrated Flint neighborhoods; my wife and I raised five children, all of 
whom graduated from the Flint Community Schools. I have served Flint as a Runaway 
Counselor, Child Care Operator, Red Cross and United Way Director and as an elected official. I 
have interacted and earned the respect of a broad array of people in Flint. I hear from people all 
over the City on a regular basis and I have been pleased to receive their constant support and 
encouragement. 

Please know that I will do everything possible to make this transition smooth and successful. We 
all have to keep our eye on the goal of putting Flint on a path to solvency, safety and 
regeneration.

To: Governor Rick Snyder, Treasurer Andrew Dillon 
From: Michael K. Brown, Emergency Manager, City of Flint 
Subject: CLOSING MEMORANDUM 


It has been a pleasure for me to serve the citizens of Flint for the past twenty-two months and I 
thank you for the opportunity to serve as Emergency Manager. 

I have worked hard to begin a cultural change to both improve the approach to city government's 
interaction with citizens and to encourage a wider range of citizen participation. It is important to 
me that the next generation of leaders (I have called them emerging leaders) not be from the 
same mold as the old leaders and have the opportunity to assume positions of responsibility as 
we set a path to the future for Flint. A significant number of my leadership team is comprised of 
Flint residents who are committed to the future of their city. While this approach has meant that 
some things may have taken longer to achieve than it might otherwise take, it has been with the 
realization that changing the culture of City Hall is imperative if history is not to repeat itself. 

I have also tried to champion citizen participation throughout my tenure as Emergency Manager. 
Collectively, hundreds of people have been involved: in the Advisory Teams for Public Safety, 
Infrastructure, Financial, and Legacy issues which I established in January 2012; in the nine ward 
public meetings held in February-March 2012; in the Police and Fire Protection millage campaign 
in Fall 2012; and in the Master Planning process which has involved citizen participation in 
numerous meetings held throughout the City over the past year. I have attached a list of some of 
these individuals who have worked on my advisory groups and the millage team . 

As our regularly submitted reports to the Department of Treasury have documented, we have 
made substantial progress in putting the city on a path to solvency and resolving the financial 
emergency. Many achievements are detailed in the latest Financial and Operating Report which 
was submitted to the Department of Treasury on June 30, 2013. Significant achievements over 
the past twenty-two months include: 


A. Financial 

1 . Developing, adopting and operating with a balanced budget for FY13 - the 
first time in seven years that the City of Flint has lived within a balanced 
budget. 

2. Significantly improving the City’s cash flow - More than $40 million in cash on 
hand as of September 2, 2013 is significantly better than the approximate 

$1 0 million on hand in December 2011. The $10 million in cash at that time 
was due primarily to an $8 million loan from the state in the form of Fiscal 
Stabilization Bonds. 

3. Significantly reducing Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) liabilities by 
more than $500 million - a 60% reduction. Not only have we significantly 
reduced legacy costs by more than 60%, we also have a plan for further 
reducing legacy costs, as detailed in recent presentations to the Department 
of Treasury 



4. Significantly reducing pension administration costs and improving investment 
returns by moving administration of the City’s pension fund to the Municipal 
Employees Retirement Fund, while also changing the structure of future 
pension benefits which will reduce future pension liabilities 

5. Developing a plan for and implementing a reduction in the City's $19.1 million 
deficit ahead of schedule . At the end of FY12, we presented a plan to the 
State Treasurer for eliminating the $19.1 million deficit within 5 years. Based 
on preliminary year end results for FY1 3, we are ahead of the scheduled 
reduction since it appears that FY 1 3 will end with a surplus of revenues over 
expenses by approximately $3 million. This will likely reduce the $19.1 million 
deficit to the $16 million range. Had the Department of Treasury authorized 
the borrowing of $12 million as contained in the approved FY12 Deficit 
Elimination Plan, the remaining deficit would now be closer to $4 million. 

6. Developing a five year financial projection which maps out the continuing 
financial challenges Flint will face, regardless of who is in charge. With FY 14 
balanced and adopted, development of the FY15 budget- which will without 
doubt be the most challenging of the next few years - is underway. In the 
process of developing the multi-year projection, it has also become clear that 
the path for Flint's financial solvency will require additional sources of 
revenue in addition to further reductions in legacy costs. We have identified a 
path for further reductions in legacy costs, and we have also identified an 
increase in the local income tax as the most promising and realistic source of 
new revenue. Unfortunately the Treasurer has not supported that initiative. 

7. Stabilizing Police and Fire Protection revenue . Since being appointed in 

201 1 , it has been clear that.the stabilization and enhancement of public 
safety is the top priority in the City of Flint. Many steps have been taken to 
achieve this, including securing voter approval of a‘6 mill property tax 
increase by a margin of 57% to 43%. Additionally, by ordinance the City must 
now appropriate no less than 55.5% of General Fund revenues for Police 
and Fire budgets. The FY 14 budget dedicates more than 60% of General 
Fund revenues to these purposes, and exceeds 80% when 9-1-1 and District 
Court funding is included. As a result, staffing for police and fire personnel 
was maintained at current levels in spite of the significant staffing reductions 
necessary to balance both the FY1 3 and FY14 budgets. Unfortunately, 
without a new source of revenue in FY15, it is unlikely that can continue. 

8. Resolving Federal Government liabilities - More than $7 million in questioned 
grant costs prior to the EM’s appointment in December 201 1 have been 
resolved - as documented by the OIG report and HUD findings. 

9. Reorganizing City operations - The City workforce has been reduced by 
more than 25% as the City has faced its financial challenges. Doing so while 
still providing for the delivery of city services has required restructuring work 
processes and organizational alignments, as well as the increased use of 
technology. These changes have been made in the context of a newly 
developed strategic plan which identifies the key functions and objectives of 
the City. 

B. Public Safety 

1 . Opening of the Flint Lock-up . The lock-up opened the week of October 1 , 

2012. Public Safety Director Lock recommended selection of the Genesee 
County Sheriff as the operator of the Flint lock-up. Lock also recommended 
that the lock-up be made available to all policing agencies operating within

Genesee County for warrants and fresh charges, both felony and 
misdemeanor. Well over one thousand outstanding warrants are being 
cleared each month. This funding by the State has been very much 
appreciated and very beneficial to the City. 

2. Creating the Criminal Justice System Advisory Council chaired by Chief 
Judge Richard Yuille. In September 2012 the first meeting of the Criminal 
Justice System Advisory Council (CJSAC) was held. Eight workgroups were 
established. Through these work groups a number of cooperative projects,

Ail Public Safety departments were operational on the 800 MHz 
communications system in December of 2012. Flint Public Safety is now 
compatible with the communications system used throughout Genesee 
County and with the Michigan State Police. 

4. Securing public safety grants totaling over $1 1 million (not including State 
funded Lock-up). A $6.9 million SAFER grant to employ thirty-nine firefighters 
for two years was received in May 2012. The Mott Foundation has granted 
the City over $1 .8 million for several public safety initiatives. The Treasurer’s

a 9-1-1 simulcast communications tower in April 2013. Homeland Security 
awarded Flint a total of $615,000 for 9-1-1 console upgrades and purchase 
of new radios for the 800 MHZ transition. 

5. Up-grading Police Department technology to improve data-driven decision 
making and capability for overall communications with Law Enforcement 
agencies at all levels of government. The Mott Foundation funded MSU 
Training & Technical Assistance Team conducted a technology audit which 
provided a road map of upgrades necessary to ensure that officers and

implementation of many public safety initiatives. Overall violent crime is down 
an average of 24% in the first six months of 201 3 vs. the first six months of 
2012 . 


C. Infrastructure (this area includes water and sewer, waste collection, roads and 
streets, bridges, parks, facilities as well as commercial and residential demolition 
targets and blight in general)

1 . Stabilizing funding for water and sewer systems . This enterprise fund 
plunged from a $60 million dollar positive balance in 2007 to a $23M deficit in 
2012. By raising water and sewer rates more than 25%, reorganizations and 
improving technologies we have been able to stop the bleeding and stabilize 
funding for the long term. 

2. Significantly improving the process and cost of providing the Flint and 
Genesee County region with water by joining the KWA. Working with the 
County Drain Commissioner and others, we have begun this long awaited 
KWA project, which will result in several hundred million dollars in cost 
decreases to residents and businesses, i want to acknowledge former 
Emergency Financial Manager Edward Kurtz for his work and detailed 
analysis which brought this complicated process to a decision point. 

3. Reducing costs for Waste Collection and implementing Recycling . By moving 
to a fee for service and contracting with the private sector waste collection 
vendor, we eliminated a General Fund subsidy of more than $1 million 
annually, and for the first time ever we are able to offer city-wide curbside 
recycling. 

4. Finalizing the Smith Village construction project . This housing development 
project has languished for over ten years, important deadlines were ignored 
and Flint was in serious difficulty with HUD. Ed Kurtz cleaned up this tangled 
project, changed developers, and moved this project significantly toward its 
final steps. Thirty-six residences have been completed, seven have been 
sold and ten purchase agreements are in process. 

5. Updating of City's 50 year old Master Plan Mayor Wailing and Chief Planner 
Megan Hunter have coordinated a city-wide, tremendously inclusive planning 
effort. Hundreds of Flint citizens have worked on sub-committees, attended 
visioning sessions and worked hard to develop a plan for a revitalized Flint. 

6. Reducing overtime costs in the Utilities division , by implementing new 
technology and reorganizations. Examples include planned elimination of the 
solid waste incinerator and electronic monitoring of the Third Ave. Pumping 
Station. 

7. Disposing of unused inventory and facilities . Auctions have been used to 
eliminate surplus equipment and vehicles while city facilities which are no 
longer required and which we can not afford to operate are being sold or 
leased. 

8. Contracting management of city ooif courses and Senior Centers in order to 
reduce city costs and still provide access to residents. 

Achieving this level of success in twenty-two months has been extremely challenging. Obstacles 
have arisen from many sources. The team in Flint has taken on each challenge and worked with 
a single-mindedness to keep Flint on the path to sustainability. We firmly believe that with 
continued effort, Flint City government can once again become a financially stable organization 
capable of delivering quality municipal services to it residents, businesses, and visitors. This route 
will involve continued cost reductions, investments in technology and personnel, and additional 
sources of revenues. The alternative of bankruptcy is not the right path - it is expensive, time 
consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. 

There are several major issues which are currently on the horizon. The shortage of revenue to 
balance the FY15 Budget is the primary issue. Public Safety staffing is still at unacceptably low 


4 





levels and with current financial conditions it is likely that the number of police officers and 
firefighters will be reduced in order to achieve a balanced budget. This likelihood is enhanced by 
the pending expiration of the FEMA SAFER grant which supports the wages and benefits of 39 
firefighters. 

Blight is an on-going major issue in Flint. We have few resources and blight issues range from 
unmowed to demolition necessary properties. Flint recently received $20 million in Federal 
“Hardest Hit” funds to demolish approximately 1600 residences, yet we have 20,000 abandoned 
homes and hundreds of vacant commercial properties. 

There has been disagreement within the community regarding the appointment of an Emergency 
Manager, about the difficult choices which were made to impose higher water and sewer rates, 
street lighting assessment and waste collection fees, and about other decisions. Yet, there has 
been no civil unrest, as threatened by a few voices. There was significant support to increase 
property taxes in an economically distressed city, because voters saw that this was the right 
choice for Flint. 

With the changes of the magnitude needed to address Flint’s conditions, there is no doubt 
controversy, disagreement, and anger can result. Often, the most vocal represent the fewest 
number. I have worked with many in the City of Flint who understand the severity of our condition 
and the scope of effort necessary to address it. If you have questions about the support given for 
the direction I have taken to restore Flint to financial solvency, i offer the names of the following

I have been a member of the Flint community for over thirty-five years. I grew up on the North 
End in one of the few integrated Flint neighborhoods; my wife and I raised five children, all of 
whom graduated from the Flint Community Schools. I have served Flint as a Runaway 
Counselor, Child Care Operator, Red Cross and United Way Director and as an elected official. I 
have interacted and earned the respect of a broad array of people in Flint. 1 hear from people all 
over the City on a regular basis and I have been pleased to receive their constant support and 
encouragement. 

Please know that I will do everything possible to make this transition smooth and successful. We 
all have to keep our eye on the goal of putting Flint on a path to solvency, safety and 
regeneration.

To: Governor Rick Snyder, Treasurer Andrew Dillon 
From: Michael K. Brown, Emergency Manager, City of Flint 
Subject: CLOSING MEMORANDUM 


It has been a pleasure for me to serve the citizens of Flint for the past twenty-two months and I 
thank you for the opportunity to serve as Emergency Manager. 

I have worked hard to begin a cultural change to both improve the approach to city government's 
interaction with citizens and to encourage a wider range of citizen participation. It is important to 
me that the next generation of leaders (I have called them emerging leaders) not be from the 
same mold as the old leaders and have the opportunity to assume positions of responsibility as 
we set a path to the future for Flint. A significant number of my leadership team is comprised of 
Flint residents who are committed to the future of their city. While this approach has meant that 
some things may have taken longer to achieve than it might otherwise take, it has been with the 
realization that changing the culture of City Hall is imperative if history is not to repeat itself. 

I have also tried to champion citizen participation throughout my tenure as Emergency Manager. 
Collectively, hundreds of people have been involved: in the Advisory Teams for Public Safety, 
Infrastructure, Financial, and Legacy issues which I established in January 2012; in the nine ward 
public meetings held in February-March 2012; in the Police and Fire Protection millage campaign 
in Fall 2012; and in the Master Planning process which has involved citizen participation in 
numerous meetings held throughout the City over the past year. I have attached a list of some of 
these individuals who have worked on my advisory groups and the millage team . 

As our regularly submitted reports to the Department of Treasury have documented, we have 
made substantial progress in putting the city on a path to solvency and resolving the financial 
emergency. Many achievements are detailed in the latest Financial and Operating Report which 
was submitted to the Department of Treasury on June 30, 2013. Significant achievements over 
the past twenty-two months include: 


A. Financial 

1 . Developing, adopting and operating with a balanced budget for FY13 - the 
first time in seven years that the City of Flint has lived within a balanced 
budget. 

2. Significantly improving the City’s cash flow - More than $40 million in cash on 
hand as of September 2, 2013 is significantly better than the approximate 

$1 0 million on hand in December 2011. The $10 million in cash at that time 
was due primarily to an $8 million loan from the state in the form of Fiscal 
Stabilization Bonds. 

3. Significantly reducing Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) liabilities by 
more than $500 million - a 60% reduction. Not only have we significantly 
reduced legacy costs by more than 60%, we also have a plan for further 
reducing legacy costs, as detailed in recent presentations to the Department 
of Treasury 



4. Significantly reducing pension administration costs and improving investment 
returns by moving administration of the City’s pension fund to the Municipal 
Employees Retirement Fund, while also changing the structure of future 
pension benefits which will reduce future pension liabilities 

5. Developing a plan for and implementing a reduction in the City's $19.1 million 
deficit ahead of schedule . At the end of FY12, we presented a plan to the 
State Treasurer for eliminating the $19.1 million deficit within 5 years. Based 
on preliminary year end results for FY1 3, we are ahead of the scheduled 
reduction since it appears that FY 1 3 will end with a surplus of revenues over 
expenses by approximately $3 million. This will likely reduce the $19.1 million 
deficit to the $16 million range. Had the Department of Treasury authorized 
the borrowing of $12 million as contained in the approved FY12 Deficit 
Elimination Plan, the remaining deficit would now be closer to $4 million. 

6. Developing a five year financial projection which maps out the continuing 
financial challenges Flint will face, regardless of who is in charge. With FY 14 
balanced and adopted, development of the FY15 budget- which will without 
doubt be the most challenging of the next few years - is underway. In the 
process of developing the multi-year projection, it has also become clear that 
the path for Flint's financial solvency will require additional sources of 
revenue in addition to further reductions in legacy costs. We have identified a 
path for further reductions in legacy costs, and we have also identified an 
increase in the local income tax as the most promising and realistic source of 
new revenue. Unfortunately the Treasurer has not supported that initiative. 

7. Stabilizing Police and Fire Protection revenue . Since being appointed in 

201 1 , it has been clear that.the stabilization and enhancement of public 
safety is the top priority in the City of Flint. Many steps have been taken to 
achieve this, including securing voter approval of a‘6 mill property tax 
increase by a margin of 57% to 43%. Additionally, by ordinance the City must 
now appropriate no less than 55.5% of General Fund revenues for Police 
and Fire budgets. The FY 14 budget dedicates more than 60% of General 
Fund revenues to these purposes, and exceeds 80% when 9-1-1 and District 
Court funding is included. As a result, staffing for police and fire personnel 
was maintained at current levels in spite of the significant staffing reductions 
necessary to balance both the FY1 3 and FY14 budgets. Unfortunately, 
without a new source of revenue in FY15, it is unlikely that can continue. 

8. Resolving Federal Government liabilities - More than $7 million in questioned 
grant costs prior to the EM’s appointment in December 201 1 have been 
resolved - as documented by the OIG report and HUD findings. 

9. Reorganizing City operations - The City workforce has been reduced by 
more than 25% as the City has faced its financial challenges. Doing so while 
still providing for the delivery of city services has required restructuring work 
processes and organizational alignments, as well as the increased use of 
technology. These changes have been made in the context of a newly 
developed strategic plan which identifies the key functions and objectives of 
the City. 

B. Public Safety 

1 . Opening of the Flint Lock-up . The lock-up opened the week of October 1 , 

2012. Public Safety Director Lock recommended selection of the Genesee 
County Sheriff as the operator of the Flint lock-up. Lock also recommended 
that the lock-up be made available to all policing agencies operating within 


2 



Genesee County for warrants and fresh charges, both felony and 
misdemeanor. Well over one thousand outstanding warrants are being 
cleared each month. This funding by the State has been very much 
appreciated and very beneficial to the City. 

2. Creating the Criminal Justice System Advisory Council chaired by Chief 
Judge Richard Yuille. In September 2012 the first meeting of the Criminal 
Justice System Advisory Council (CJSAC) was held. Eight workgroups were 
established. Through these work groups a number of cooperative projects, 
streamlined operations and new collaborations have been identified and 
numerous projects continue to move forward. 

3. Completing the transition to 800 MHz public safety communications system. 
Ail Public Safety departments were operational on the 800 MHz 
communications system in December of 2012. Flint Public Safety is now 
compatible with the communications system used throughout Genesee 
County and with the Michigan State Police. 

4. Securing public safety grants totaling over $1 1 million (not including State 
funded Lock-up). A $6.9 million SAFER grant to employ thirty-nine firefighters 
for two years was received in May 2012. The Mott Foundation has granted 
the City over $1 .8 million for several public safety initiatives. The Treasurer’s 
Office through the C-GAP funding awarded the City $1 .8 million to construct 
a 9-1-1 simulcast communications tower in April 2013. Homeland Security 
awarded Flint a total of $615,000 for 9-1-1 console upgrades and purchase 
of new radios for the 800 MHZ transition. 

5. Up-grading Police Department technology to improve data-driven decision 
making and capability for overall communications with Law Enforcement 
agencies at all levels of government. The Mott Foundation funded MSU 
Training & Technical Assistance Team conducted a technology audit which 
provided a road map of upgrades necessary to ensure that officers and 
firefighters can take maximum advantage of the tools already provided to 
them. New World Systems, Flint’s records management system, required 
server and switch upgrades before the New World update could be made. 
Each of these components has now been completed and the use of the full 
feature set of New World is being implemented throughout the FPD. 

6. Implementing 12 hour shifts for Police Patrol Officers which put more officers 
on the street and vastly reduced overtime in the department. 

7. Taking major steps toward the reconsolidation of the Flint City 9-1-1 with the 
Genesee County 9-1-1 consortium. The C-GAP grant to build the 
communications tower will enhance system coverage for the entire County. 

8. Improving Public Safety Response Recently compiled statistics for FBI Part 
One violent crimes show significant improvements have resulted from the 
implementation of many public safety initiatives. Overall violent crime is down 
an average of 24% in the first six months of 201 3 vs. the first six months of 
2012 . 


C. Infrastructure (this area includes water and sewer, waste collection, roads and 
streets, bridges, parks, facilities as well as commercial and residential demolition 
targets and blight in general) 


3 



1 . Stabilizing funding for water and sewer systems . This enterprise fund 
plunged from a $60 million dollar positive balance in 2007 to a $23M deficit in 
2012. By raising water and sewer rates more than 25%, reorganizations and 
improving technologies we have been able to stop the bleeding and stabilize 
funding for the long term. 

2. Significantly improving the process and cost of providing the Flint and 
Genesee County region with water by joining the KWA. Working with the 
County Drain Commissioner and others, we have begun this long awaited 
KWA project, which will result in several hundred million dollars in cost 
decreases to residents and businesses, i want to acknowledge former 
Emergency Financial Manager Edward Kurtz for his work and detailed 
analysis which brought this complicated process to a decision point. 

3. Reducing costs for Waste Collection and implementing Recycling . By moving 
to a fee for service and contracting with the private sector waste collection 
vendor, we eliminated a General Fund subsidy of more than $1 million 
annually, and for the first time ever we are able to offer city-wide curbside 
recycling. 

4. Finalizing the Smith Village construction project . This housing development 
project has languished for over ten years, important deadlines were ignored 
and Flint was in serious difficulty with HUD. Ed Kurtz cleaned up this tangled 
project, changed developers, and moved this project significantly toward its 
final steps. Thirty-six residences have been completed, seven have been 
sold and ten purchase agreements are in process. 

5. Updating of City's 50 year old Master Plan Mayor Wailing and Chief Planner 
Megan Hunter have coordinated a city-wide, tremendously inclusive planning 
effort. Hundreds of Flint citizens have worked on sub-committees, attended 
visioning sessions and worked hard to develop a plan for a revitalized Flint. 

6. Reducing overtime costs in the Utilities division , by implementing new 
technology and reorganizations. Examples include planned elimination of the 
solid waste incinerator and electronic monitoring of the Third Ave. Pumping 
Station. 

7. Disposing of unused inventory and facilities . Auctions have been used to 
eliminate surplus equipment and vehicles while city facilities which are no 
longer required and which we can not afford to operate are being sold or 
leased. 

8. Contracting management of city ooif courses and Senior Centers in order to 
reduce city costs and still provide access to residents. 

Achieving this level of success in twenty-two months has been extremely challenging. Obstacles 
have arisen from many sources. The team in Flint has taken on each challenge and worked with 
a single-mindedness to keep Flint on the path to sustainability. We firmly believe that with 
continued effort, Flint City government can once again become a financially stable organization 
capable of delivering quality municipal services to it residents, businesses, and visitors. This route 
will involve continued cost reductions, investments in technology and personnel, and additional 
sources of revenues. The alternative of bankruptcy is not the right path - it is expensive, time 
consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. 

There are several major issues which are currently on the horizon. The shortage of revenue to 
balance the FY15 Budget is the primary issue. Public Safety staffing is still at unacceptably low 


4 





levels and with current financial conditions it is likely that the number of police officers and 
firefighters will be reduced in order to achieve a balanced budget. This likelihood is enhanced by 
the pending expiration of the FEMA SAFER grant which supports the wages and benefits of 39 
firefighters. 

Blight is an on-going major issue in Flint. We have few resources and blight issues range from 
unmowed to demolition necessary properties. Flint recently received $20 million in Federal 
“Hardest Hit” funds to demolish approximately 1600 residences, yet we have 20,000 abandoned 
homes and hundreds of vacant commercial properties. 

There has been disagreement within the community regarding the appointment of an Emergency 
Manager, about the difficult choices which were made to impose higher water and sewer rates, 
street lighting assessment and waste collection fees, and about other decisions. Yet, there has 
been no civil unrest, as threatened by a few voices. There was significant support to increase 
property taxes in an economically distressed city, because voters saw that this was the right 
choice for Flint. 

With the changes of the magnitude needed to address Flint’s conditions, there is no doubt 
controversy, disagreement, and anger can result. Often, the most vocal represent the fewest 
number. I have worked with many in the City of Flint who understand the severity of our condition 
and the scope of effort necessary to address it. If you have questions about the support given for

7) Water Issues 

a) The City Council met twice to discuss the sale of a 9 mile section of 
unused pipeline to the GCDC. The City had negotiated a sale price of 
$3.9 million. Council first voted to reject the sale. A second meeting 
resulted in a vote to sell the pipe section for $3.9 million but receive the 
funds in two payments over two fiscal years. It is unknown if the City 
council made a submission of this proposal to the local emergency 
financial assistance loan board. Does Flint have Treasury’s approval to 
execute the contract of sale?

Interim Water Quality Report 


Weekl 


Week 2 

o Provide a review of current 


o Carry out more detailed study 

actions 


of initial findings 

o Engage staff, visit facilities 

i |x \ 

o Make recommendations for 

and analyze data 

: - 

Improving water quality 

o Make interim report 


o Provide a plan, cost and 
schedule for change 


Items of Note 

• Not in scope - studying why the change from DWSD or the history of the utility 

• What we found - A very frustrated community and a staff trying to solve the problem, 
having some success but frustrated with the pace of change 


© February 18, 2015 Flint Public Works Committee

Everybody Is Checking the Safety of Water 


oCity, state, news media, universities and 
other groups 

oSafe = compliance with state and federal 

standards and required testing 

o Latest tests show water is in compliance with 
drinking water standards 

o Monthly report available on web page 

oMore than 20,000 tests required annually 
for city 

o Strict testing requirements in place (what 
and how to test) 





oTTHM is formed as a result of the reaction between chlorine 
and organic material in the water 

o City is required to test quarterly at 8 sites 

o Last summer, several sites had more TTHM than allowed 

oCity has reduced levels of TTHM and now all sites are in 
compliance 

o Customer notification letters are required until tests are in 
compliance an average of four quarters 

o It will take at least 2 more quarters to lower average 

o Even a change to DWSD water doesn’t solve problem 

o Flint is not alone - hundreds of communities are facing 
TTHM issues 


© February 18, 2015 Flint Public Works Committee 




Why Discolored Water? 


Ml 




o Old cast iron pipes 

o Always has been some 
discolored water problems ■ 
mostly after water breaks 

o Efforts to reducing TTHM 
didn’t help discoloration 

o Doesn’t mean the water is 
unsafe but it is not appealing 
and raises questions 

o City will test the water at 
your home - call 787-6537 
or email 

flintwater@cityofflint.com 

o Tracking customer 
complaints is important 


Location of water quality complaints 
The last 12 months - fewer than you think

or months due to State approval being required or weather. 

o Cost of changes - Don’t know yet but we are aware of the 
financial concerns

o How are TTHM formed - It’s the reaction of chlorine to 
organics (leafs, dirt) in the water. 

o How to reduce TTHM - Reduce organics before introducing 
chlorine and shorten time chlorine has to react with the 
organics 

o What causes discoloration - Older lines, the iron parts of 
the system will leach iron into the water causing the 
discoloration. Other times its just air built up. 

o Why no discoloration with DWSD - There was. Flint had 
a bad time with breaks of old line and is doing lots of 
construction. This stirred up the water and caused 
discoloration.

o Can you test my water - The city will test your water for 
free. But, only 2 of 20 people have taken the city up on the 
offer since it began offering the service. 

o Medical problems - Some people may be sensitive to any 
water. Talk to your doctor. The City is communicating with the 
medical community. 

o Confidence that future problems will be avoided - 

Recommendations will include putting programs in place to 
better respond to water changes and assure quality

Attachments: 2015 Q2 Strategic Plan Update.pdf; 2014 Year in Review Master Plan.pdf 


Dear Citizens and Stakeholders: 


The City of Flint is continuing its efforts of implementing the adopted master plan and organizational strategic 
plan. The integration of the strategic plan into the organizational processes is also a key component in the seven 
point transition management plan to guide the way by which the operation of the City will be assumed by the 
Mayor and City Council. 


Flint City government is focused on enabling Flint to become an attractive place to live, work, play, study, and 
visit. In order to do this, the city government must become and remain financially stable, must provide 
residents, businesses, students, and visitors with an adequate level of municipal services. It must also have the 
capacity to encourage and guide others in the achieving its vision and goals. 


Each quarter the City is producing a report. The first quarter of FY15 ended on September 30, 2014 and the 
results were reported to the public last October. We are now pleased to share the progress which has been made 
during the second quarter, which ended on December 31, 2014. Also attached is the 2014 summary of 
accomplishments related to the master plan. We have identified more than 100 strategies underway with nearly 
$15 million in activities. As you review the summary here and attached reports, please consider sending us your 
feedback and ideas. The strategic plan is currently being revised to extend to 2020 and the report on the master 
plan is being expanded by including more projects from partners. 


With the strategic plan, over 300 specific objectives are identified in the current plan, with 98 now completed. 
They include increasing public safety, improving infrastructure, creating jobs and development, eliminating 
blight, engaging citizens and managing the financial and administrative challenges which are reflective of an 
organization striving to regain sustainable financial solvency. Much of this work is done in partnership with the 
community and everyone is to be commended for their willingness to embrace change. 


Important areas of progress from this past quarter include: 

❖ - Voters approving the creation of a charter commission and the adoption of charter amendments to 
strengthen financial management and reduce administrative costs. 


l 



❖ - City Council supported a package of ordinance reforms to codify the strategic planning process and the best 
practices in financial management. 

❖ - Flint recorded its lowest number of homicides in more than ten years and the overall violent crime rate was 
down compared with 2013. 

❖ - Flint’s economy continues to improve steadily with coordinated economic development efforts supporting 
more than 300 jobs in 2014 including jobs with expanding companies in health care, manufacturing, retail, and 
environmental technologies along with new small businesses. 

❖ - Improvements in infrastructure are progressing in accordance with the strategic plan and completed 
combined capital improvement plan despite the evident challenges with water quality and costs. 

❖ - A new City of Flint website has been launched to provide citizens, businesses, students and visitors have 
access to timely information regarding services and information. 

♦> - The FY2014 audit was completed on time and confirms the reduction in the General Fund deficit to less 
than $9 million and the stabilization of other City accounts. 

♦♦♦ - The transition from state oversight to home rule is advancing with the new City Administrator starting and 
the preparation of a final list of items to be completed before April 2015. 

While significant progress has been made on many fronts, significant challenges and risks remain. One primary 
issue, of course, is water quality. We all know it is a very serious concern, and our staff is working every day to 
improve water quality with the guidance being provided by independent consultants with expertise in improving 
water quality where the source of water is a river. We also posted on the City’s web site answers to questions 
which have been raised in the community along with testing data so we are fully transparent. Another issue is 
the low level of resources available to address public safety issues in the City. As you know, we commissioned 
an independent study of our police and fire organization in order to assess our capacity and to determine how to 
best organize our police and fire departments in light of their diminished resources. 


The issues surrounding water and public safety emphasize the tenuous financial situation of the City — one 
which, while significantly improved, will remain tight. The five year financial projections done last year, and 
the adopted budgets for FY15 and FYI 6, showed financial stability for FY15 and FY26, but projected a very 
significant gap between revenues and expenses for FYI 7. Balancing the FYI 7 budget in a financially 
responsible manner will be a challenging task. If decisions become necessary to further reduce the workforce 
and service levels, they will be very difficult, as there are no easy answers. Likewise, responding to demands for 
high levels of service and lower costs in the form of water rates or taxes will also be difficult. 


We will be looking to the community and partners to continue to be engaged and work with us on solutions. For 
instance, the new Water Advisory Board is being established. If you are interested in participating on the new 
board, other commissions, or becoming more involved in any way, please contact mavor@cityoffIint .com . And 
again, we welcome your feedback on the revision of the strategic plan and the compilation of master plan 
accomplishments.

City of Flint Strategic Plan, Second Quarter Report 


In 2014 the City Council of Flint adopted a Strategic Plan for the City of Flint. This plan 
announced a vision, mission, and goals to guide the operation of the City government for the next 
five years and was adopted in the context of the City’s recently adopted Master Plan for the 
community. It was followed by a statement of budget priorities adopted by the City Council and 
ultimately by a biennial budget for FY15 and 16. The budget also projected the city finances for 
the following three years - FY17, FY1 8, and FY19. During this same period a Deficit Elimination 
Plan and Reserve Accumulation Plan was approved by the State and a Seven Point Transition 
Management Plan was enacted to guide the way by which the operation of the City will be assumed 
by the Mayor and City Council. The integration of the Strategic Plan into the organizational 
processes of the City is a key component of the Seven Point Transition Management Plan. 

In total, these actions comprise a broad framework guiding the direction of the Flint City 
government as it restores financial stability and once again becomes an active leader focused on 
making Flint a safe, secure city attractive to residents, businesses, students and visitors. 

The first quarter of FY15 ended on September 30, 2014 and the results were reported to the public 
in October. A copy of that report is available on the City’s web site. 

We are pleased to report on the progress which has been made during the second quarter, which 
ended on December 31, 2014. While significant progress has been made on many fronts 
significant challenges and risks remain. 

We wish to commend the Management Team and our employees for their dedicated efforts to 
move the City forward. We look forward to discussing the contents of the report with you.

Qvervieif 


The progress of the City of Flint is now defined by the steps it takes to achieve its stated vision, 
mission, and goals. Flint City government is focused on enabling Flint to become an attractive 
place to live, work, play, study, and visit. In order to do this, the city government must become 
and remain financially stable, must provide residents, businesses, students, and visitors with an 
adequate level of municipal services. It must also have the capacity to encourage and guide 
others in the achieving its vison and goals. 

Achievement of the vison will be measured by the progress which is being made towards 
specific goals and objectives. Over 300 specific objectives are identified in the current plan, with 
nearly aoo completed. They include increasing public safety, improving infrastructure, creating 
jobs and development, eliminating blight, engaging citizens and managing the financial and 
administrative challenges which are reflective of an organization striving to regain sustainable 
financial solvency. Much of this work is done in partnership with the community and everyone is 
to be commended for their willingness to embrace change. Important areas of progress from 
this past quarter include: 

Voters approving the creation of a charter commission and the adoption of three 
charter amendments to strengthen financial management and reduce administrative 
costs. 

❖ City Council supported the first reading of a package of ordinance reforms to codify the 
strategic planning process and the best practices in financial management. 

❖ Flint recorded its lowest number of homicides in more than ten years and the overall 
violent crime rate was down in nearly all areas, compared to 2013. 

❖ Flint's economy continues to improve steadily with coordinated economic development 
efforts supporting more than 300 jobs in 2014 including jobs with expanding companies 
in health care, manufacturing, retail, and environmental technologies along with new 
small businesses. 

❖ Improvements in infrastructure are progressing in accordance with the strategic plan 
and nearly completed combined capital improvement plan. 

❖ A new City of Flint website is ready to be launched in January, providing citizens, 
businesses, students and visitors have access to timely information regarding services 
and information. 

❖ The FY2014 audit was completed on time and confirms the reduction in the General 
Fund deficit to less than $9 million and the stabilization of other City accounts. 

❖ The transition from state oversight to home rule is advancing with the announcement 
of the new City Administrator and the preparation of a final list of items to be 
completed before April 2015. 



Assuring Accountability to Adopted Plans and Budgets 

As the City of Flint continues to work towards its adopted Vision of being, “a well-managed, 
financially stable, and accountable government," there is a shared commitment to continually 
updating and improving plans and budgets. The City Council is poised to adopt a package of 
ordinance reforms to codify the strategic planning process and the best practices in financial 
management. The ordinance reforms will require the City of Flint to establish priorities, regularly 
update the five year strategic plan, adopt a biennial budget, receive quarterly reports on the 
status of the budget, consider quarterly budget amendments, and develop appropriate fund 
balances and retiree health care reserves. 


This is a report on the progress made during the three month period ended December 31, 2014. 
This three month period is the second quarter of the City's Fiscal Year 2014, which began July 1, 
2014. A first quarter report was presented to the community in October, 2014, and is available 
on the City's web site.

The City of Flint is increasing public safety through the involvement of the community, 
collaboration with the Michigan State Police, Genesee County Sheriffs Department and other 
law enforcement partners, and, most importantly, the hard work of the Flint Fire Department 
and Flint Police Department along with the 911 center and courts. While managing force 
reductions as required by the budget, success is notable in the following: 


❖ The City has selected the State Records Management System for replacement of its 
current system. 

❖ The Citizens Radio Patrol is now active and planning on expansion in 2015. 

❖ Leads on Line has been implemented and is functional. 

❖ 100% of Flint school children have been provided with fire safety and prevention 
education and all Senior Centers have been provided with fire safety and prevention 
information. 

❖ Fire suppression personnel have distributed arson reward literature in the community. 

❖ A reorganization has been implemented within District Court resulting is reduced costs 
and upgraded technology. 

❖ A reduction in Violent Part 1 Crimes continues, including a 40% reduction in homicides; 
with the exception of arsons, other major areas are also showing a decline. 

❖ Response time to calls for service for the Police Department has been reduced by 7.5%, 
but still short of the goal of 8%. 

❖ An alternate plan to calls for service not requiring direct police response is being 
developed to further reduce response time and to improve effectiveness of available 
resources. 

❖ An organizational study of the police and fire organization and staffing is nearing final 
completion, and will give guidance to future organizational and budgetary decisions 
regarding public safety.

The mission of the City of Flint Government is to assure that residents, businesses, students and 
visitors receive municipal services in a customer friendly and financially responsible manner. 
Infrastructure, in the form of utilities, streets, trails, and waste collection, are vital municipal 
services that require ongoing attention due to the age of current systems and the express desire 
of the community for modern improvements. Despite evident challenges, the Department of 
Public Works has developed plans and steps are being taken to strengthen Flint's infrastructure 
systems. Strategic objectives have been met, or are in progress in these areas: 


❖ A list of capital improvement needs for city facilities was developed and provided to the 
public for review as part of the development of the Capital Improvements Plan portion 
of the MasterPlanning process, which is scheduled for final submission to the Planning 
Commission and the Flint City Council in January 2015. 

❖ Repairs and improvements to the City's water treatment and distribution system are 
being made to ensure the water is safe to drink and for all other purposes. 

❖ A written pipe replacement matrix has been developed for determining the priority of 
pipe replacement annual plans. 

❖ Infrastructure repairs on the water and sewer system continue with nearly 40 valves 
replaced this quarter alone. 

❖ The process of selecting a vendor to replace all inoperable residential meters is 
underway. 

❖ Engineering has started for the replacement of seven miles of underground pipe. 
Replacement is scheduled to begin this spring. 

❖ Work has started on rebuilding manholes as a part of the water infiltration elimination 
program. 

❖ A list of potential shared services opportunities with Genesee County has been 
developed. 

❖ The process of selecting a vendor and funding mechanism to provide an energy 
evaluation of the City Hall campus is underway. 


Fostering Jobs and Development 

The City's Department of Planning and Development has the mission of organizing and 
facilitating, "targeted investment and rational, well-designed and physically integrated land use 
and development that advances economic prosperity, eliminates blight and stabilizes 
neighborhoods, protects the environment, and provides a better quality of life in the city." With 
the adopted Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint as a framework, the Department is working with 
partners to support long-term planning, comprehensive economic and community development 
including effective planning, zoning, business licensing and permitting, and parks maintenance. 
A number of efforts are being made to implement the specific strategies identified in the master 
plan, including developing a Capital Improvement Plan and a new zoning code. Other initiatives 
are underway that leverage grants and opportunities that fit within the community's vision. 
Areas of progress include: 


❖ Coordinated economic development efforts supporting the creation more than 300 jobs 
and $850 Million in capital investment in 2014 including jobs with expanding companies 
in health care, manufacturing, retail, and environmental technologies along with new 
small businesses. 



❖ A review of the process of submitting planning applications was conducted in order to 
assure that applications are processed in a timely manner. 

❖ At least three "Adopt a Park" agreements have been executed to fulfill the initial 
commitment in the Strategic Plan and the "Friends of Berston" has been established as 
an independent non-profit organization. 

❖ The capacity for conducting rental inspections will be increased shortly as a contract for 
inspection services is being finalized. 

❖ Significant progress has been made with the sale of homes at Smith village, with only 9 
of the 39 remaining unsold. 

❖ Ongoing coordination with the Land Bank to continue demolitions* 

❖ A draft of the City's comprehensive 5-Year Blight Elimination Framework has been 
completed and is being circulated for review by the public, partners and the Planning 
Commission with the intention of an adoption as a policy document in the coming 
quarter. 

❖ An agreement with MDOT has been executed which will allow the construction of the 
Genesee Valley trail and connection to the new Chevy Commons to begin this spring. 

❖ A preliminary draft of the City's Zoning Code has been completed and is being prepared 
for public review in 2015. 

❖ A draft of the Capital Improvement Plan has been completed and shared with the 
public; consideration of adoption by City Council is planned for January 2015. 

❖ A planning grant application to the EPA was submitted in order to provide for 
additional planning forthe area around Chevy Commons. 


Managing Financial and Administration Challenges 

As the City of Flint moves to resolve the financial emergency, a number of financial and 
administrative challenges are being managed in accordance with the Strategic Plan. The 
following objectives have been completed: 


❖ The City's accumulated General Fund deficit has now been reduced to less than $9 
million from the $12.9 million which existed as of June 30, 2013, more than double the 
amount targeted in the state adopted Deficit Elimination Plan. 

❖ A City Administrator has been selected to lead the City government as it transitions 
from oversight by an Emergency Manager back to home rule. 

❖ A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City's utility system 
have been completed, concluding that no change in ownership status would be 
beneficial at this time. 

❖ A decision has been made to rejoin the County 911 Consortium, which will improve 
service to the Flint community while reducing overall costs. 

❖ Video capabilities have been improved in City Council Chambers, providing for 
improved recording of Council proceedings. 

❖ A review of professional development needs for city officials, department heads, and 
employees has been completed. 

❖ A new fixed asset accounting policy has been implemented. 

❖ The FY14 audit has been completed and filed with state 

❖ An Internship program has been established forthe Finance Department. 

❖ Staffing is now in place to enhance delinquent collections. 

❖ The office space for the Assessing Division has been renovated to address health and 
safety issues. 



❖ New labor contracts were negotiated and implemented with AFSCME 1600 and 1799, 
and FPD Command officers, providing consistent benefit packages, achieving short and 
longterm costs, and improving efficiency of operations. 

❖ A new labor contract was imposed on FPOA for the same purposes. 

❖ Modifications to exempt employee policies were approved for the same purposes. 

❖ A new Family Medical Leave Act administration program was implemented. 

❖ A new Employee Assistance Program was implemented. 

❖ Several specific vehicle and equipment acquisitions were made. 

❖ New lease arrangements for several vehicles were also implemented. 

❖ GPS tracking units were installed on several city vehicles as a pilot project. 

❖ A regular schedule of seasonal meetings with DPW to assess vehicle readiness was 
established. 

❖ A technology training calendar was established for all employees. 


V.sLy wi > v.! KSHCS VSVS!K| 4 ViWwU 

Progress continues on the remaining objectives, with progress to be reported in the next 
quarterly report. Challenges to the City's progress continue in the form of events such as: 


❖ While the transition from DWSD to KWA is underway, including the use of the Flint 
River on a temporary basis, the work of producing treated water continues to be 
complicated by the systems' aging infrastructure and varying temperatures. 

❖ The departure of three key management staff in Finance and Human Resources will 
affect timelines for completion of some objectives. 

❖ Difficulties in finding qualified candidates for plumbing and mechanical inspectors has 
affected the timeliness of providing inspections. 

❖ The inability of the City and IAFF to reach a mutually acceptable labor contract 
patterned after the basic terms and conditions in all other contracts has resulted in a 
delay in achieving desired cost savings. 

❖ The slow progress of the retiree health care lawsuit continues the uncertainty of the 
City's financial stability. 

❖ Slow deployment of budgeted personnel assigned to delinquent tax collections may 
affect the ability to reach targeted revenues amounts. 

❖ Evidence of consistent instances of water theft has required the assignment of public 
works, finance and public safety personnel to investigate and prosecute offenders. 


U j c v, I. > y c r % u U U U Us s \ H s U V t:. U 

A viable plan must be flexible enough to adjust to unexpected circumstances and these 
modifications need to be made transparent to the community. Significant adjustments to this 
plan as of the end of the second quarter include: 


❖ Objectives for improving City 911 operations are being replaced With the objective of 
transferring City 911 operations to the County 911 Consortium by July 1, 2015. 

❖ An objective of developing an agreement with Genesee County for the consolidation of 
the 67 th and 68 th District Courts by January x, 2016 will be added. 

❖ An objective of improving inventory control in the Utilities and Fleet divisions by June 
30, 2015 will be added. 

❖ An objective of selecting permanent replacements forthe City Treasurer, Human 
Resources Director, and Finance Director no later than April 30, 2015 will be added. 



♦> An objective to reduce instances of water theft by 50% no later than June 30, 2015 will 
be added. 

❖ An objective to develop policy review and recommendation regarding the "My 
Brother's Keeper Initiative" by February 1, 2015; and to develop and help launch action 
plan by September 1, 2016 will be added. 

❖ Secure funding and complete construction of a road diet, and addition of bike lane, 
along Harrison Street by September 1, 2016, per the Master Plan, will be added. 

Conclusion 

Adoption and implementation of a strategic planning process is one of the elements identified 
by Flint's Emergency Manager in the 7-point Transition Plan as necessary for the transition back 
to Home Rule. Progress is being made in accordance with the expectations of the Strategic Plan 
and its specific objectives. Significant steps are being taken to improve its financial condition 
and to restructure the organization to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Steps are also being 
taken to prepare the City for return to traditional Home Rule governance. 

The second quarter report shows completion of a number of specific objectives and progress on 
others. There have also been a number of unexpected events which have or will affect timely 
completion of objectives, or resulted in the elimination or addition of others. These types of 
adjustments are to be expected in the implementation of any plan. 

The positive progress outlined in this report must be read in the context of the current overall 
condition of the City of Flint. The level of services currently provided by the City is marginal as it 
struggles to regain financial solvency. Flint continues to be challenged by population loss, 
relatively low per capita income, aging infrastructure, and an insufficient revenue stream to 
support a desired level of services. It still has a significant General Fund deficit to be addressed, 
along with significant legacy costs. And it still faces the possibility of insolvency should the 
challenge to changes in retiree health care prevail.

A YEAR IN REVIEW - MASTER PLAN 

H C S 8 fTA § j&S A O 1 £T Cl B&i’T 

OR SUil AIM/%BLE FLIsm i 

Since the adoption of the Master Plan on October 
28, 2013, the community commitment to advancing 
the hundreds of strategies found in the plan has truly 
been amazing. Likewise, the City of Flint has fully 
embraced the Master Plan, relying on it heavily to 
develop the five-year strategic plan and two-year 
budget. Other Flint institutions and organizations 
have also revised their own strategic plans and 
priorities to align with the Master Plan. Perhaps most 
remarkable are Flint's residents who willingly volun- 
teered thousands of hours and contributed a variety 
of resources to maintain parks, rehabilitate houses, 
and mow vacant lots in alignment with the Master 
Plan. As we review our 2014 achievements, it is 
important to highlight our biggest accomplishment; 
the creation of a new community culture around 
Master Plan implementation. 

This document a Year in Review is more of a broad 
synopsis broadly highlighting the master planning 
work. However, due to our pledge regarding account- 
ability and transparency, the Department of Planning 
and Development (DPD) will work with the Planning 
Commission, Steering Committee, and other stake- 
holders to more accurately quantify the impact of 
the Master Plan. In February, the DPD will present a 
draft Annual Report to the Planning Commission for 
further vetting and ultimate approval for widespread 
distribution. Even in a more detailed annual report, 
we recognize that it will be difficult to quantify the 
collective community impact aligned with the Master 
Plan. 

In drafting this synopsis, we took a very conservative 
approach in quantifying the impact. The total num- 
ber of projects identified is tied directly to a Master 
Plan strategy and involves mostly new grants or shifts 


in funding to accomplish a specific strategy, in a few 
instances, the synopsis includes grants awarded to 
an entity other than the City. In these circumstances, 
the City was closely involved in securing the grant, 
but felt the partnering agency was better positioned 
for implementation. 

Over the course of 2014, 118 Master Plan strategies 
were initiated with an estimated of nearly $15 
million. 

2014 accomplishments that have a larger impact that 
the chapters outline below include; 

• Selection by the White House as one of seven 
Strong Cities, Strong Communities. The initiative 

is providing additional federal staff support to help 
implement the Master Plan 

• Development of a draft Zoning Code, which will be 
vetted by the community in early 2015 and 
transmitted to City Council for consideration in the 
spring 

• Creation of new financial policies and ordinances 
and ongoing strategic planning to ensure the City 
operates in an open and financially stable manner 

It goes without saying that the achievements out- 
lined in the following pages are really the commu- 
nity's achievements, in particular, we want to thank 
the Mayor and City Council, Planning Commission, 
Master Plan Steering Committee, and Implementa- 
tion Task Groups who continue to guide the Master 
Plan Implementation.

Civic engagement and community outreach remains 
at the forefront of Master Plan Implementation, Built 
through extensive public interaction over the duration 
of the planning process, trust with Flint residents and 
community members continues to drive our work. 
Transparency, accountability, active public partici- 
pation and collaboration were identified as the key 
characteristics to uphold a high level of civic life, one 
of the 6 Guiding Principles identified by Flint citizens 
throughout Imagine Flint. 

Over the course of 2014, the City: 

® Partnered with 45 neighborhood and block-based 
groups 

• Hosted over 75 public meetings and community 
events and engaged over 1,500 unique individuals 

• Convened and facilitated 34 implementation 

Task group meetings connecting with 78 individuals 
monthly on master plan implementation 

® Partnered with Flint Community Schools to host a 
21st Century town hall meeting on Community 
Education, nearly 300 individuals 

• Trained and recruited over 50 volunteers for 
community wide events 

• Hosted 2, interactive design-charrettes for planning 
processes 


• Hosted 11 monthly Steering Committee meetings, 
attracting over 400 members of the public 


• Hosted 3 
over 80 p 


Improvement Meetings drawing 


Launched the "My Brother's Keeper" initiative, 
engaging over 180 individuals 

Reached 995 "likes" on Facebook, reaching over 
1,000 individuals weekly 

Averaged over 50 "hits" weekly on the Imagine Flint 
website 

Released 11 unique newsletters, reaching over 218 
individuals per mailing and generating 2,407 


Civic Engagement Spotlight: 

Imagining Community Education - A 21st Century 
Town Hal! Meeting 

In response to the feedback regarding Community 
Education throughout the master plan process, Flint 
Community Schools and the City of Flint partnered 
together to host a first-of-its-kind workshop around 
Community Education in Flint Schools. Aimed at 
identifying what Community Education means to Flint 
residents, participatory tools and technology were 
used to form consensus, generating real-time polling 
through small group discussion and data collection. 

The workshop presented a tremendous opportunity 
for residents to assist the Flint Community Schools 
with crafting a vision for the future of a sustainable 
model of community education in Flint and addressed 
a primary strategy in chapter 9 of Imagine Flint: "The 
reinstitution of a sustainable form of community edu- 
cation through K--12 schools, community centers, and 
early learning sites". Over 250 individuals attended 
with 78% identifying as Flint residents. 





Throughout the Master Planning process, it was clear 
that residents and stakeholders wanted the City to 
concentrate its efforts on neighborhood stabilization 
and blight elimination. Thus, the City crafted its Blight. 
Elimination Framework and focused most of the 
implementation efforts around neighborhood clean- 
ups, mowing, demolition, and housing rehabilitation. 
Realizing that better data and planning was needed to 
more effectively target investment, the City secured 
funding for a target housing market analysis, received 
an allocation of eight AmeriCorps VISTAs, and applied 
for two neighborhood planning grants. 

16 Housing & Neighborhoods projects have been 
undertaken with an estimated value of $4.8 million 
involving support of 51 neighborhood groups and 
community organizations. 

Project Highlights include: 

® Development of a CDBG funded neighborhood 
mini-grant program to distribute more resources to 
local, grassroots revitalization efforts 

® Coordination with the Land Bank, FARO, Diplomat 
and the neighborhood residents in securing an 
additional $2,600,000 for demolition in the Civic 
Park Neighborhood 

® Completion of a citywide neighborhood assessment 
including 51,607 parcels and auditing 11,478 street 
lights 



Housing & Neighborhoods Spotlight: 

Beyond Blight 5~¥ear Elimination Framework 

A key strategy within the Housing & Neighborhoods 
Chapter, the Beyond Blight Elimination Framework 
was released in 2014. The detailed and data-driven 
plan lays out an aggressive approach to eliminate 
blight in Flint within 5-years by focusing on seven key 
activities for blight elimination. These include: dem- 
olition, code enforcement, waste removal, mowing, 
boarding, vacant lot reuse, and building rehabilitation 
and redevelopment. 

As the five-year cost of removing blight in Flint is 
estimated at roughly $112 million, the Framework 
proposes collaborative blight elimination between 
residents, local government, institutions, community 
groups, and businesses and developers. It also recom- 
mends priorities and strategies for eliminating blight 
in Flint in alignment with the City's land use plan. A 
six-month engagement effort occurred after the draft 
framework was released, with staff hosting 16 gath- 
erings attended by more than 500 individuals. Blight 
budgeting and mapping exercises were utilized to 
create highly interactive settings with participants. 




The Master Plan understands the importance 
of establishing a sustainable, modern, and safe, 
multi-modal transportation network that efficiently 
provides for the needs of all people and businesses. 
Working towards this vision, plan implementation 
focused on trail construction and acquisition, 
complete street development, wayfinding and pedes- 
trian improvements, and strategic coordination with 
the MTA. 

10 Transportation & Mobility projects with an 
estimated value of over $1.4 million and involving 6 
neighborhood groups and community organizations 
have been initiated. 

Project highlights include: 

• Initiation of the City's first walkability audit carried 
out by the implementation task group 

® Kick off on construction of the the Genesee 
Valley Trail including over $700,000 of MOOT and 
CDBG funding 

® Design work for complete street conversion of 
Harrison and Saginaw Streets 


Transportation & Mobility Spotlight: 

Grand Traverse Greenway Trail Place Plans Initiative 

The Greenway Trail is a 3-mile long former rail line 
that the City is working to acquire and convert to 
a non-motorized public trail through support from 
MDIMR, MDOT, MSHDA and the Michigan Municipal 
League. The City and South Saginaw Task Force were 
awarded a Place Plan designation to guide a commu- 
nity-led design process. They also created a concep- 
tual design that would provide a sense of connection 
between places along the trail, as well as support 
both recreational needs and safety interests. Over 70 
different individuals were engaged through the mul- 
tiple meetings and the Place Plan grant was matched 
through a $6,000 donation from Diplomat Pharmacy. 
In all an estimated $700,000 worth of investment has 
been contributed to the project. 







Plan implementation focused on establishing Flint as a 
proactive environmental leader with a dean, healthy, 
and equitable system of parks, waterways, and open 
spaces. To facilitate this goal, the newly formed 
Department of Planning & Development assumed 
the day-to-day responsibilities of parks maintenance, 
programming and improvements in July. With limited 
funding and staff resources, the new department 
formalized dozens of partnerships to help maintain 
and construct public improvements within Flint's 
network of parks and open space. 

20 Environmental Features, Open Space & Park 
projects were kicked off representing an estimated 
value of over $1,4 million involving partnerships with 
18 neighborhood groups and community organiza- 
tions. 

Project highlights include: 

® The Max Brandon Eco-Park Initiative 

• Park Management Agreements with Crim Fitness 
Foundation, Genesee County Parks and Recreation, 
and Genesee Conservation District 

® Park stewardship initiatives such as the City Adopt- 
a-Park partnership with Keep Genesee County 
Beautiful and neighborhood-led park planning 
efforts in Brennan Park 


Environmental Features & Parks Spotlight: 

Max Brandon Eco-Park Project 

The Max Brandon Eco-Park Project is a 2-year 
initiative, generously funded through grants from 
GLAA-C and the Ruth Mott Foundation, As one of 
the first Imagine Flint implementation projects, this 
$87,500 initiative implements numerous strategies of 
the Master Plan, including the healthy maintenance of 
urban woodland, wetland expansion for storm water 
retention, and habitat restoration through the remov- 
al of invasive species and planting of native vegeta- 
tion. As a collaborative, community based initiative, 
the Max Brandon Eco-Park project has involved the 
cooperation of 7 neighborhood groups and communi- 
ty organizations, including the Friends of Max Bran- 
don Park, Salem Housing, Crim Fitness Foundation, 
Genesee Conservation District, and Genesee County 
Parks, and has involved the engagement of dozens of 
residents and community members.

Aging infrastructure coupled with years of deferred 
maintenance and a lack comprehensive capital im- 
provement planning have further weakened Flint's 
utility system, adding to the high costs of water 
and sewer services. Recognizing that better capital 
improvement planning can improve the efficiency, 
reliability, and longevity of our infrastructure includ- 
ing water distribution, the Department of Planning 
& Development in concert with the Department of 
Public Works drafted the City's first comprehensive 
Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). This Plan is scheduled 
to be presented to the City Council by February 2015 
for adoption. 

In addition to the development of the CIP and approx- 
imately $16 million in City capital improvements, 18 
Infrastructure & Community Facilities projects were 
launched in 2014 with an estimated value of nearly 
$200,000 and support of 6 neighborhood groups and 
community organizations. 

Project highlights include: 

® CDBG funding for programming and improvements 
at the Haskell Youth Center through the Flint Police 
Activities League (PAL) and Boys and Girls Club 

® Formation of the non-profit organization Friends of 
Berston with over $100,000 in capital 
improvements to Berston Field House through 
CDBG funding 

® Conversion of 50 sodium and mercury street lights 
into new, high-efficiency LED bulbs in the Centra! 
Park Neighborhood saving the City over $2,500 
annually. This is the first LED streetlight conversion 
that Consumer's Energy has ever installed. 



/ 





in 2014, the community strongly coalesced around 
the Objective #1, Strategy #1 in the Master Plan 
"re-instituting a sustainable form of community 
education through K-12, early learning centers, and 
community centers". As a result, the Mayor and 
Department of Planning & Development, several 
community-based organizations, and Flint parents and 
students committed to working with Flint Community 
Schools in piloting a community education program at 
the Brownell/Holmes STEM Academy. 

Another education focus this year was literacy. The 
City contributed significant CDBG resources to Mott 
Community College for the establishment of the Flint 
& Genesee Literacy and Basic Skills Network. Through 
this network, dozens of community stakeholders are 
helping improve coordination and increasing resourc- 
es for literacy. 

The City has played a vital role in spurring economic 
development through business attraction, econom- 
ic development incentives, and case management 
services. In 2014, the City supported the creation of 
more than 300 jobs and $850 Million in capital in- 
vestment and collaborated with regional partners on 
the development of a Regional Prosperity Plan and 
Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy. The 
City has also begun an internal re-organization of its 
zoning, permitting, and licensing services resulting in 
better response times. In 2015, the Planning & 
Development Department will expand online licensing 
services, create a centralized business counter, and 
enhance case management services with the goal of 
receiving Michigan Economic Development Depart- 
ment (MEDC)'s "Redevelopment Ready" certification. 
IB Economic Development 8s Education projects 
have been undertaken with an estimated value of 
$4.8 million. 


Project highlights include: 

® Organization of a 21st Century Town Hall meeting 
on community education in partnership with Flint 
Community Schools with nearly 300 participants 

® Award of a $2.6 million grant for reconstruction of 
two critical street segments around Buick City 

* Ongoing collaboration with the Flint & Genesee 
Literacy Network and commitment of nearly 
$230,000 in CDBG funding for literacy programming 

• Award of an EPA grant in the amount of $1.9 million 
for the construction of a vegeta tive cap over a 
brownfield known as Chevy-in-the-Hole

This year, the City has focused on improving efficien- 
cy of the Police and Fire Departments, particularly 
through advances in technology and community 
involvement. Upgrades to communication systems, 
better usage of data to target resources, and im- 
proved collaboration between Saw enforcement, 
agencies have helped the City achieve significant 
reductions in violent crime and arson. For example, in 
2014, the City achieved a 42% reduction in homicides 
from 2013. Moreover, the City has made tremendous 
strides in rebuilding trust between police and resi- 
dents, resulting in additional community partnerships 
such as the newly established Citizens Radio Patrol. 
This improved community collaboration is generating 
more leads, more arrests, and solved cases. 

Currently, 26 Public Safety, Health & Welfare projects 
have been initiated with an estimated value of over 
$2.4 million. 

Project highlights include: 

• Construction of a $1.4 million 911 dispatch and 
communications tower 

® Launching of crimemapping.com software to 
provide easy access to crime data for residents and 
establishment: of a new Citizens Radio Patrol 
Program 

* Award of $1,000,000 from the Justice Department 
to Kettering University to address safety and crime 
in the University Avenue Corridor.

Over the course of 2014, numerous Flint art and 
cultural institutions have embraced the Master Plan, 
expanding offerings to Flint residents and providing 
free space for Master Plan meetings and events. 

Many of these institutions have also begun working 
with Flint Community Schools to reach out. to more 
Flint youth and define their involvement in communi- 
ty based education. At this point it is hard to quantify 
the overall value of these contributions, but it is 
clearly in the hundreds of thousands. 

In addition to the related work of these larger arts 
and culture institution, 10 grassroots Arts & Culture 
projects have been undertaken with an estimated 
value of over $20,000, involving the support, of 2 
neighborhood groups and community organizations. 
The City has also partnered with 5 local arts & cultur- 
al organizations to provide access to arts & cultural 
opportunities in City parks and community centers 
and provided significant input into the development 
of the Cultural Center Master Plan. 

Project highlights include: 

® Partnership with the Flint Public Art Project on the 
integration of public art within Master Plan subarea 
locations 

« Expansion of more arts & cultural programming in 
the Neighborhood Center place type and within 
other neighborhood venues accessible to more 
residents 

® input in the development of the Cultural Center 
Master Plan to ensure alignment with the City’s 
Master Plan

Attached is the release with the proper date. 


For Immediate Release 


Recent Tests Show Flint Water within EPA Guidelines 


Flint, Michigan - February 27, 2015 - The Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing lab has provided results to the City of Flint showing that 


1 



test results for TTHM levels for the month of February are well within EPA 
guidelines for safe water. All eight testing sites showed levels of TTHM ranging 
between 14.9 and 28.5 micrograms per liter (pg/L), well below the Maximum 
Contamination Level of 80 (see chart below). 

The testing results confirm the progress made by the City to address concerns 
regarding the safety of its water supply and corroborates findings by the City and 
independent tests by other organizations that the water today is safe. “Flint’s 
water supply is meeting all safety guidelines set forth by the EPA,” said DPW 
Director Howard Croft. “Today’s findings by the MDEQ reinforce the progress 
we have made, and should help rebuild confidence in the safety of Flint’s drinking 
water. We still have work to do to improve water quality and are committed to 
being vigilant to assure that water safety is maintained.” 

These results also show that the four month average for test results is now within 
EPA guidelines for five of the eight testing areas in the City. However, because 
EPA regulations require that the four month average for all testing sites be within 
guidelines, the City of Flint will still be considered to be out of compliance by 
MDEQ. The City expects to receive notice within the next few weeks indicating 
non-compliance, and system users can expect to receive official notice of non- 
compliance in the month of March. 

Meanwhile, the City continues to work on maintaining water safety and 
improving water quality. While steps are being taken daily to improve quality, the 
City is expecting a formal set of recommendations from its water quality experts 
within the next few weeks. 

The detail of the study results, a report of the progress being made and 
preliminary recommendations from Veolia will be shared with the newly formed 
Water Advisory Committee and Water Technical Committee, whose first 
meetings are scheduled for next week.

being vigilant to assure that water safety is maintained.” 

These results also show that the four month average for test results is now within 
EPA guidelines for five of the eight testing areas in the City. However, because 
EPA regulations require that the four month average for all testing sites be within 
guidelines, the City of Flint will still be considered to be out of compliance by 
MDEQ. The City expects to receive notice within the next few weeks indicating 
non-compliance, and system users can expect to receive official notice of non- 
compliance in the month of March. 

Meanwhile, the City continues to work on maintaining water safety and 
improving water quality. While steps are being taken daily to improve quality, the 
City is expecting a formal set of recommendations from its water quality experts 
within the next few weeks. 

The detail of the study results, a report of the progress being made and 
preliminary recommendations from Veolia will be shared with the newly formed 
Water Advisory Committee and Water Technical Committee, whose first 
meetings are scheduled for next week.

Chemical Free Water Disinfection by Ozone 


Today about 98% of water treatment facilities in the U.S. use some form of chlorine to disinfect 
drinking water supplies. It is a cost effective method for destroying potentially harmful bacteria 
and viruses. However, chlorine’s ability to interact with organic compounds in water leads to 
trihalomethanes (THMs) formation. Especially, river or lake water with high level of organic 
matter require heavy chlorination to combat high level of bacteria, resulting in dangerous levels 
of THMs and bad smell. THMs, when ingested can encourage the growth of free radicals that 
can destroy or damage vital cells in the body. Besides cancer, exposure to THMs has been 
linked to other health issues including asthma, eczema, heart disease and higher miscarriage 
and birth defect rates. Further, high level of chlorine also poses serious risk to the aging 
infrastructure. 

Chemical free water disinfection technologies such as UV light and ozone have long been 
recognized to be much safer than chlorination, however, their high cost has prevented wider 
adoption. The basic mechanism of ozone 
generation and disinfection is shown in 
the picture. Ozone has a high oxidation 
potential (much higher than chlorine) and 
a superior response time compared to 
other sanitizing products. Its high 
oxidizing potential enables ozone to break 
down organic matters that chlorine 
cannot. Some pollutants can only be 
oxidized by ozone. For example, Cryptosporidium Parvum, a drinking water pollutant, is 
resistant to most disinfectants, but is effectively destroyed by ozone. Most importantly, the 
emission from ozone is pure oxygen and it leaves no residues. 

UV light is a competing non-chemical sterilization technique. Intense UV rays break down the 
sensitive RNA and/or DNA of microorganisms, thus preventing the organism from reproducing. 
Ozone, on the other hand, oxidizes the microorganisms, thus destroying their cells completely. 
UV sterilization being a line of sight process, to be effective, one needs to remove most of the 
suspended matter prior to the treatment. In contrast, ozone oxidizes the soil or particulate 
matter, changing or destroying the chemistry of the soiling materials such as organic 
compounds. 

Despite the great benefits of ozone, its widespread adoption is limited due to the high total 
ownership cost of current commercial ozone generators. Somnio’s AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator is 
a paradigm shift in ozone generation technology. The first and only commercial barrier less 
ozone generator eliminates the requirement of dielectric barriers and highly filtered dried oxygen 
(pure or enriched) supplies, which restrain current commercial ozone generators. This 
groundbreaking technology brings a market-competitive, robust, energy efficient, and scalable 
modular device that offers a financially attractive alternative with the capability of producing 
varying levels of ozone depending on the application at hand. 

Producing ozone cost effectively is only part of the greater story of the far reaching benefits of 
ozone. Applying ozone effectively for a given application requires careful and intelligent design, 
sensing and monitoring. In addition to its revolutionary AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator, Somnio 


Gas Discharge 




collaborates with end users to provide complete and economical turnkey solutions. Somnio’s 
current in-house test plant incorporates all necessary safety features and automation.

Sorry I missed the meeting. Had a couple conflicts. Here’s what I want to share with you: 

1 . 


2 . 


3. Flint Water: had a meeting yesterday with a company Baird put in the room to discuss their 
ozone technology. It was a good conversation but a non-starter for several reasons (Flint 
already has an Ozone system to modify its water, this company hasn’t had its system certified 
for use on public drinking water supplies, and the problem they propose to address is not at 
the water plant but throughout various sections of the distribution system). More broadly, 
Harvey is looking for a ‘thing’ the state can be doing for Flint that will position SOM / RS 
positively. Suggestions range from handing out home water filters (think Britta faucet mount) to 
passing out jugs of water. After consulting with our experts in the Drinking water program, what 
we’ve really come to at DEQ is that if there’s funding from treasury (or some charitable donor 
foundation), the best short-term use of dollars would probably be to hire a company to ‘pig’ the 
lines in the distribution system. This is a routine maintenance activity in municipal systems that 
involves an in-line device under pressure that clears funk out of the lines. The good news on 
Flint : Flint EM Jerry Ambrose noted yesterday that the city has some work to do on its system 
in the weeks ahead; the TTHM issue is quickly going away; the ‘brown water’ folks are loud but 
really few in number; the consultants are doing their work to make suggestions to help the city 
prioritize its needs; and, broadly, nobody seems to be targeting the administration recently.

Subject: PRESS RELEASE: EM Authorizes DWRF Bond Restructuring 


Flint Emergency Manager Authorizes Bond Restructuring to Afford Additional $2.24 

Million toward Capital Improvements in Water 


Flint, Michigan - March 19, 2015 - Flint Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose today authorized a restructuring of 
four outstanding Drinking Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) bonds to allow postponing current principal 
payments in the total amount of $2.24 million. This action will allow the $2.24 million budgeted for debt 
service to be utilized for expenses associated with maintaining safety and improving quality of the Flint water 
supply. Approval of the State Treasurer is required before the restructuring can occur. 

Flint has recently received a final report from Veolia, its water expert advisor, making a series of 
recommendations to maintain and improve the Flint water supply. These recommendations, and other items 
identified in the City’s current capital improvements plan, will be considered as the City develops and 
implements its action plan to maintain and improve the Flint water supply. Discussion on the development of 
the action plan will begin today, March 19, 2015 at the Water Advisory Committee meeting, scheduled to begin 
at 2:00 pm at the Flint Public Library. 

The State of Michigan was instrumental in allowing the restructuring, as approvals are required by both the 
State Treasurer and the Director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. “At all levels, the State 
of Michigan has been most cooperative in assisting the City of Flint as it addresses the many issues confronting 
the Flint water system”, said Ambrose. “Access to $2.24 million at this time will be very helpful in moving 
forward with our action plan.” 

The proposed restructuring will free up funds to enable the City to more quickly begin implementing 
recommended improvements to its water treatment and distribution system. Several recommendations for 


l 



improvement are currently unbudgeted and the $2.24 million will help assure that the most important can be 
performed. 


Recommendations to be considered include the addition of a Granulated Activated Carbon Filter, estimated at 
as much as $1.5 million; acceleration of the repair and replacement of values, estimated at an additional 
$120,000 annually; additional pipeline replacement, estimated at $1 million per mile; and acceleration of the 
project to automate plant operations, estimated at $450,000. $1,315 million will become available in the City’s 
current fiscal year, and the remaining $925,000 will be available in the next fiscal year. 

The bonds are currently financed at a rate of 2.5%, and postponement of the principal payment will incur some 
additional interest expense over the life of the issue. While the interest rate will not increase, the total interest 
cost will increase by approximately 2% ($228,000) over the 20 year life of the issues.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Flint 

Emergency Manager: Gerald Ambrose 
Appointed: January 13, 2015 
Anticipated Exit : April 20 1 5 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the city’s water system 
through improved waste management, leak detection, and pipe assessments. 

An EM Order is being prepared that will restructure its SRF loans. This would free up 
approximately $2.2M allowing the city to further improve its water system. 

- The City of Flint had informed residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of 
February are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe 
water. However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all 
testing sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant 
by the MDEQ. Monthly testing will be ongoing, and is being conducted by several 
parties. 

The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements, and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. On March 19, 2015, the report was presented to 
the Flint Water Advisory Committee, but the presentation broke down due to citizen 
unrest. An International City/County Management Association (ICMA) comprehensive 
public safety study has been completed, and was presented to the City Council on 
January 22, 2015. Several recommendations for both police and fire are currently being 
reviewed. Of the 16 major recommendations for public safety, the following four are 
most crucial: 

o Establish more aggressive protocols for responding to service demands from the 
public.

Subject: Flint Water Issue - Rep. Kildee Letter Received By Federal Agencies 

Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

To be honest I am not sure... i don't have the history/background to know whether we would actually turn 
them/communities down ( & we might) if they can't fully fund their project. I arn sure that area (assessing) is in chaos 
as weli in Flint. 

If that were the case i.e., we would say no to the assessing project; then yes in terms of the switch to water related 
projects. I think the number 1 heard yesterday was 10,000-15,000 filters for $250k. Or maybe you create a program 
to replace the curb-to-home lead piping. 


The call with Flint got cancelled today. They are not available now at that time.

Thanks. Are you suggesting they modify their request to one that asks for money for filters instead of the assessing 
since the assessing cost exceeds the grant and they couldn't do the project anyway?

One of my 'take-aways' from the meeting this afternoon was to follow up on whether they could 
use those Distressed Cities' $s for filters. Remember last year they did receive $2mm which they 
used for water related items. This year they want funds for the property assessing area. Their 
project cost is more than the grant limit, it is not clear they realize that. The deadline application is 
Oct 15 if they were willing to change the application. Assuming that is doable. 

With Wayne away ( and before the 1:00 mtg)... a call was set up actually earlier today with Natasha 
Henderson. Do you care if we still do that ? The email setting it up is attached. Obviously we are 
not going to commit to anything. 

Let me know if you need anything eise.

Tom, 


Below are the answers to your questions, if you have any further questions, let us know. Thank you. 


Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these (FDCVT) $s ? 

ANSWER: We received an application from the City of Flint on September 17 th . The amount requested for the project is 
$2M (the limit for a local unit) and it is estimated to take $3.1M to complete the entire project. They also indicated that 
if full funding is not awarded, it is doubtful that they will be able to move forward with the project. The proposed 
project is: 

"The city proposes to hire a qualified contractor to provide property assessing services. Specifically, this 
contractor will create digital property sketches of all improved properties, evaluate existing property conditions 
and improvements by providing real property data verification, and conduct a comprehensive appraisal 

valuation study. This process will take place over a period of 3 years, from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2019." 


Do we know if they have plans to? 

ANSWER: Since they asked for the entire $2M for the above project, we would assume they are not submitting any 
further projects, however we are not sure. 


And have they asked (& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, and If so, what did they use those $s for? 

ANSWER: Treasury awarded Flint two grants in FY 2015 under the FDCVT program. Treasury has not yet received any 
reimbursement requests from the City. Therefore, we have not distributed any of the FDCVT grant related funds to the 
City. The two grants are:

The writeup below was included in Flint Water Talking Points from last winter. 

The City has received significant financial assistance through both grant programs and bond 
restructuring initiatives administered by the Ml Department of Treasury. This financial 
assistance has allowed the City to replace miles of aged pipeline and begin efforts to install a 
specialized filter at the Water Treatment Plant. 

In February, Flint was awarded a total of $2 million through two Financially Distressed Cities, 
Villages, and Townships Grants. $1.1 million was awarded for water system enhancements

to? And have they asked (& rec’d) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, [knowing that it 
hasn't been going that long], if so, what did they use those $s for. 


Finally, if they hadn't applied yet... given the current Flint water situation; 

Could they use these grant funds to purchase filters for individual residents for use in their homes ? 


if you can get back to me quickly I would appreciate it Thanks

Poke, the bureau director there, has already talked to DEQ about some pipe inspection in Flint schools, but we may be

suggestions.

the last several years with winter fuels. Mostly the same cast of characters with a few departmental additions and a 
switch in the impacted interest groups. If Dan (or someone else) wants to run lead, I could loan Karen Towne to either 
staff/organize the meetings/calls or train the department staff person on the template of how these work. She is pretty 
experienced in organizing this kind of thing.

Subject: ACTION NEEDED on Flint water documents 


Good afternoon Governor, 


Sorry for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHHS is hoping to issue the release this 
afternoon to avoid issuing news on Friday. The DHHS team has answered the questions and 
made significant revisions to the press release at my request. 1 think this is far more reader 
friendly and people focused. 


Here are the specific answers to the questions: 


Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to lead sources is 
reduced. The purpose of screening children for lead is to identify those with elevated levels. 
Removing potential sources of lead exposure and ensuring proper nutrition and healthcare leads 
to decreases in blood lead levels in follow-up testing, which is an important part of case 
management. Lead has a half-life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 
days; and in the non-labile portion of bone, more than 25 years. 


l 



Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter 
of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors 
including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer months. 


DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr Wells available to answer questions. 


Thank you for your consideration. 


Dave 


The notifications will be timed as follows: 


1:30 p.m. 

• Send final embargoed release and summary report to:

Subject: ACTION NEEDED on Flint water documents 

Good afternoon. Governor, 


l 



Sorry for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHHS is hoping to 
issue the release this afternoon to avoid issuing news on Friday. 
The DHHS team has answered the questions and made significant 
revisions to the press release at my request. I think this is far more 
reader friendly and people focused 


Here are the specific answers to the questions: 


Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place 
and exposure to lead sources is reduced. The purpose of screening 
children for lead is to identify those with elevated levels. 
Removing potential sources of lead exposure and ensuring proper 
nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in blood lead levels in 
follow-up testing, which is an important part of case management. 
Lead has a half-life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft 
tissue, about 40 days; and in the non-labile portion of bone, more 
than 25 years. 


Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is 
highest during the third quarter of each year - July through 
September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors 
including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer 
months. 


DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr Wells available 
to answer questions. 


Thank you for your consideration. 


Dave

Subject: RE: Edwards Report Response 

With edits from the gov's team in bold.. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has consistently provided information 
regarding blood lead levels in the city of Flint. 

When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase 
appeared to be consistent with the routine seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months. It wasn't 
until the Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by ZIP 
code, controlling for seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result 
of this process, we have determined that the way we analyze data needs to be thoroughly reviewed. 
Additionally, Gov. Rick Snyder has created a Flint Water Task Force to review all city, state and federal 
responses and actions and is expected to make recommendations moving forward. 

Our department is focused on ensuring that appropriate case management and follow up is occurring in 
Flint. Summary reports outlining blood lead level testing are posted online on a bi-weekly basis, and we 
are working closely with local partners to fulfill data requests as we receive them. 

Regarding the FOIA, Mr. Edwards received all of the requested documents, with personal information 
redacted, on Friday, December 18.

Don't know but could it be someone with health credentials. If not from Flint then "Local" in my mind means other then 
state. Any other local health department experts (not Genessee county) that could lend a local perspective?

So just to you-has it been decided that it is only our responsibility to fix? 
Is it mere resource request. Wouldn't the chair be the singular lead with 
the co-Vice chairs having some skin in the game? At the end of the day 
it will be important for the locals to buy in at the 
responsibility/programmatic level. I am new to the discussion so will 
yield to your expertise. Keith

The concern I have with having a local as a vice chair is 
that this is being pushed to the state level to fix. Similar 
to an emergency that reaches the state level, we need 
to have one lead to move this forward and that should 
be at the state level. I have run numerous state and 


l 



federal disasters in this manner. The locals are pushing 
the request for resources to the state so this is them 
saying they cannot do anything more and handing this 
off to the state. This is one of the areas I mentioned 
that needs to stay consistent with the Emergency 
Management Act and how we manage incidents. 


Locals still have a voice in this (one way is that they are 
generating the requests for resources to assist).

Thanks for the opportunity to comment. I agree with 
Jim that it would be good to have a local entity at least 
be a co vice chair if possible. I would question 
statement of need wording and ask that it be reflect of 
the need for additional resources, integrated approach, 
additional professional expertise, enhanced 
communication, coordination and connection. ..you get 
the gist. Rich I would be happy to discuss at your 
convenience if appropriate. This would appear 
consistent with the request from Flint. Also in my 
limited (and I stress limited) discussions today I asked 
what success looked like and it included many of the 
suggested components. The individual I was speaking 
with wanted to further explore: 

Increased funding/focus for Head start to get ahead of 
the curve 

School nutrition and distribution systems (year around) 
Fresh produce/local foods 

Individual health screening 
Infrastructure improvements 

I know most if not all are identified in the outline but 
might want to further explain the nutrition component 
if the Docs in the group say it might be beneficial for 
those involved. 

Thanks again-Keith

A Proposal to Create the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee 

(FIACC) 

In collaboration with the Flint After-Action Task Force, MSP Captain Chris Kelenske, DHFHS Chief Deputy 
Tim Becker and DFIFIS Director Nick Lyon, Flarvey Hollins and Rich Baird are recommending the 
immediate creation of the above referenced entity, with its sustained role and responsibility enabled 
under the Governor's Executive Order. 

Statement of Need 

Due to a combination of resource constraints, inexperienced personnel, "silo" bureaucratic processes 
and reactionary approaches to immediate problems, there is a n e arly comp l et e lack of coordination, 
communication, and connected management amongst all the departments and stakeholders who must 
work together to ensure Flint's return to clean, safe water and to coordinate mid and long term efforts 
to mitigate and address future health and behavioral consequences from lead ingestion. This group 
MUST be stood up regardless of whether (or when) the conditions required for a declaration of 
emergency are met by the City, County, State or Federal authorizers. This coordinating body must 
include: 

• The creation of a routine information process between all parties. 

• Pursuit of other avenues of funding including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• While the Emergency Management Act or the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
may not be mechanisms to fix all the issues in Flint, portions of the Emergency Management Act 
outlining management of emergencies or disasters events are applicable and should be 
implemented without delay (e.g. Local emergency operations plans/emergency operations guides as 
well as emergency operations support plans). 

Action Plan and Establishine the FIACCC 

It appears that a request for a Governor's declaration may be from the county as soon as January 4, 
2016. The state's Deputy State Director of Emergency Coo r d i n a tor Management and Homeland Security 
(Capt. Kelenske) will evaluate the request and provide a recommendation whether to issue a 
declaration, following established protocol and due diligence. But immediately, we will: 


1 . Establish an interagency workgroup Chaired and Vice-Chaired by Flarvey Hollins and Chris Kelenske, 
respectively, and be comprised of DFIFIS, MDEQ, MSP, Treasury, Genesee County, City of Flint, MDE, 
LARA and external Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Civil Rights may be added at a later time. If 
additional agencies/stakeholders who can assist with accomplishing the action plan are needed, 
they will be added. Personnel must be goal oriented, transparent with findings and measures of 
progress, and able to work toward accomplishing the Incident Action Plan created by the state in a 
timely manner. A draft Organization Chart is attached under separate cover. Staff will be needed 
that is familiar with disaster/emergencv planning, operations, logistics, and finance as outlined by 
the National Incident Management System (NIMS). These management components would report 
to the chair/vice chair and ensure resource requests are tracked and the incident action plan 
objectives are created, documented, and completed. 

2. This body should be created by Executive Order and it must complement and not replace the 
current system under the Emergency Management Act. In fact, it should demonstrate how to best 
leverage support where existing laws fall short under a man-made emergency. 

3. Utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as appropriate. 

4. Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive, and legislative levels as 
determined appropriate. 







5. Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 
Interagency Workgroup Objectives 


1. Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 

■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to all stakeholders and interested parties. 

■ Logistics plan for distribution and serving homebound citizens with water and 
filtration 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods. 

■ Nutrition education and support 

■ Coping with lead exposure (care, monitoring, neurodevelopmental screening, access 
to DBP specialists, psychologists/psychiatrists, expanded county services, etc.) 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community of the situation 
and actions taken. 

■ Identify existing Public Information outlets within the city, county, and state. 

■ Establish a Joint Information Center 

■ Provide for Emergency Alerts and Updates 

■ Leverage public and private education schools 

■ Determine official information flow and approval of information. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water 
system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 

■ Develop priorities, costs, and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades 
as part of a long term recovery plan. 

■ Seek partners to assist (NGOs, Foundations, Business, etc.) 

■ Implement the plan. 

Final Thoughts 

After the team provides input to this document, I would ask that Governor Snyder review and approve 
the approach, authorize Flarvey Hollins to get the plan to Mayor Weaver no later than this weekend, and 
then proactively communicate the plan regardless of whether we get an Emergency declaration or not. 

Also, we do not believe s e tting up activating a n Em e rg e ncy Comm a nd the State Emergency Operations 
Center (SEOC) which requires 24/7 staffing |is| sensible until AFTER Genesee County has demonstrated 
they did all they could , utilized all available resources to include contracts and mutual aid, -and couldn't 
solve the problem. Additiona llv, this incident is more in the recovery phase where other types of 
coordination center are utilized. That is what is required under the fa wEmereencv Management Act . 


Comment [CK1]: We do not always have 24 our 
staffing, it is dependent upon the incident.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 9, 2015, DEQ staff held a conference call with staff from the city of Flint 
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to discuss DEQ’s comments 
regarding EPA’s preliminary assessment of corrosion control optimization for the city of 
Flint. The preliminary assessment was to identify and document activities necessary to 
enable the EPA and the DEQ to provide advice and support the city in maintaining 
optimal corrosion control while maintaining their source of water from Detroit as well as 
during and after the upcoming transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) 
pipeline. During the discussion, it was agreed that the document needed to be broken 
down into two separate documents. The first document would identify the absolute 
needs necessary for Flint to transition to the KWA for their source water. The second 
document would outline actions that the city of Flint could take moving forward that 
would provide useful scientific information but would not impede the transition to the 
KWA. 

On December 1 1 , 201 5, staff from the DEQ, the EPA, and the city of Flint, along with 
their consultant (Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. [LAN]), met to discuss the various 
projects that needed to be completed in order for the city to switch its water source to 
the KWA. The main topic of discussion was how to balance the overarching concern of 
ensuring that the transition did not create safety issues, while at the same time taking 
precautions to ensure that the project did not run overtime or over budget. There were 
a number of proposals made during the discussion, and LAN will meet with the EPA on 
December 15, 2015, to discuss the various options in more detail. 

On December 11 and 12, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted a plumbing 
evaluation and subsequent sampling of the fixtures used for drinking water consumption 
at the Flint Community School’s administration building and Holmes 3-6 STEM 
Academy in Flint. There were a total number of 74 samples taken at 12 different 
locations throughout the administration building and 222 samples taken at 43 different 
locations throughout the school. There were 296 samples taken in total at the two 
facilities. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report since last week. 

Concerns : 

During the meeting on December 1 1 , 201 5, among the DEQ, the EPA, the city of Flint, 
and LAN, the EPA proposed that the city of Flint run a 12-inch line in addition to the 
existing main that would enable the city of Flint to conduct in-depth studies for switching 
to the KWA. The cost of this line would be approximately $4 million, and currently there

Page 2 


is no funding source identified that could cover this expense. The city expressed 
concerns that it was being asked to cover expenses for measures that other supplies 
would not be expected to implement. LAN will meet with the EPA to discuss other 
options. 

Significant Event : 

On December 8, 2015, the Department of Technology, Management and Budget 
(DTMB) confirmed that the e-mail sent from Liane Shekter Smith on August 25, 2015, to 
Lee-Anne Walters was successfully delivered to the gmail.com system at the e-mail 
address provided by Ms. Walters. The DTMB was asked to confirm delivery of that 
e-mail based on an accusation that the DEQ never responded to an inquiry, and then 
when a copy of the original e-mail was provided, an accusation was made with respect 
to the authenticity of the e-mail. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• DHHS incorporated comments from the DEQ regarding a phosphate fact sheet 
being designed for public education purposes. DHHS then finalized the fact 
sheet utilizing the suggestions provided by the DEQ. 

• Instructions for lead and copper sampling were finalized, based on comments 
received from the EPA. The final draft was shared with city of Flint personnel on 
December 11, 2015, for use in their next round of lead and copper compliance 
monitoring. Microsoft Word and pdf versions were posted on the DEQ Web site 
on December 14, 2015, to replace the previous version of the instructions. 

• The city of Flint has hired an outside consultant to identify 150 Tier 1 sites for a 
sampling pool for use in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule. This effort 
is being taken to ensure that future sampling events include verified and 
documented Tier 1 sampling sites to ensure compliance with the Lead and 
Copper Rule. 

® DEQ staff visited Control Station #2 to observe the operation of the phosphate 
feed system. The inspection of the phosphate feed system confirmed that the 
system is in operation and the system is dosing at 2.5 mg/I as phosphate. A 
couple of minor provisions had not been completed at the time of the inspection 
but do not currently affect the operation of the supplemental addition of 
phosphate to the water. 

• DEQ staff modified the Act 399 construction permit for the Flint raw water 
transmission line. The modification was needed to allow for rerouting of the 
transmission main due to poor soil conditions that were encountered along the 
original route.

DRINKING WATER LEAD AND COPPER SAMPLING INSTRUCTIONS 


Dear Resident: 

Thank you for helping to monitor for lead and copper in your drinking water. This sampling is 
required by the federal and state Safe Drinking Water Acts, and is being accomplished with 
the cooperation of homeowners, residents, and water system customers. 

It is important that you follow these instructions so we obtain an accurate measurement of the 
lead and copper in your drinking water. This sample should represent the water you would 
typically drink and the faucet from where you drink the water. Select a faucet for sampling 
that was used the day before you intend to sample. Call your water supply if you have 
questions. 

1 . Water must sit idle in the pipes for an extended length of time before sampling. 

Therefore, do not use any water in the house for at least 6 hours before sampling. The 
best times to sample are early morning or after returning from work. 

2. Select an unfiltered/untreated faucet in the KITCHEN or BATHROOM that is commonly 
used for drinking. DO NOT sample from a laundry sink or a hose spigot as these samples 
cannot be used for compliance. DO NOT use a faucet that has a filter attached to it 
unless you bypass the filter. DO NOT use a faucet that is connected to a home water 
treatment device (like a water softener, iron filter, reverse osmosis) unless you bypass the 
home water treatment device. 

3. Place the open sample bottle below the faucet and gently open the COLD water tap. If 
you have a single handle faucet, turn it fully to the COLD side. Fill the sample bottle to 
the neck with the “first draw" of COLD water. 

4. Tightly cap the sample bottle and place in the sample kit provided. Review the sample kit 
label to ensure all information contained on the label is complete and correct. 

5. Answer the questions on the back of this form and sign the form. 

6. Attach this form to the bottle and leave it outside your front door for pick-up. 

7. Thank you again for your help. We will send you your individual results within 30 days of 
receiving them from the laboratory. A summary of information on this year’s lead and 
copper monitoring will be printed in the annual water quality report that will be made 
available by July 1 of next year. Contact your water supply if you have questions.

Paul, 

You should probably start joining these calls. I only join for the very beginning where we discuss public safety 
and I do not usually say anything, just listen, answer questions or tell them i will get back to them on public 
safety issues that come up in Flint. We originally started this to keep tabs on the previous EM and Chief but the 
existing ones are fantastic and really do not need hand holding. It is helpful for you to hear what they are doing 
though. I always hang up when they move to the financial stuff. Sam can probably reach out to Maxine to add 
you.

City of Flint Wednesday 9:00am Phone Conference Agenda 

August 20, 2014 


1) Public Safety Update - FPD, MSP, (FFD, if needed) 

a) FPD - 

i. FBI vs FPD stats variation 

b) FFD 

c) Traffic Accidents Resulting in Death of Flint Citizens - Update on Strategies Special 
ALP ACT Meeting scheduled for August 22, 2014

collaboration. 

e) Other update from Chief Tolbert and MSP 


2) Governor’s Office Update - R. Baird, H. Hollins, B. Clement 

a) Court Consolidation 


3) Lawsuits - Status, Issues 

a) Retiree Lawsuit - On June 30, 2014 Judge Tarnow issued an order modifying in part his 
preliminary injunction barring the City from modifying retiree health care benefits. While 
the details of the Judge’s recent order are still being reviewed, and while the details of 
implementing the order are still being developed, it appears that the ruling will have a 
positive financial impact on the City, at least for the period while the litigation continues. 
A meeting between the City and Cornerstone was held on July 21, 2014 to discuss the 
compilation of alternatives based on Judge’s new orders. An implementation date is 
anticipated in the second quarter of the year. 


4) Financial Update 

a) Remaining bargaining units in “meet and confer” sessions: Fire, Sgts., and Capts. & Lts. 

b) Need to start to develop a plan to begin pre-funding employee healthcare. 


5) City Council Update 

a) Councilman Eric Mays was sentenced to 72 days in jail following impaired driving 
sentencing. He was released, pending appeal, with a $15,000 bond. 

b) Council wants to retain an attorney for an outside legal opinion on when the 18 month 
term (to allow them to remove the EM) commenced. They discussed asking Darnell for 
the money to hire an outside attorney, but they ultimately have decide to pool their own 
money. 

c) A grid-timeline is being developed using the 7 point Transition Management plan. This 
will be used as an itemized list of steps to be completed in order to prepare for transition. 
(See attached) 



6) Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance 

a) Five Charter Amendments and the question of whether to have a general revision of the 
current charter have been placed on the November ballot. These were as recommended 
by the BRC. 

7) Water Issues 

a) The cost of providing water is becoming a state- wide issue for distressed 
communities. Let’s begin a larger conversation on both the impacts and the potential 
limitations for cities and how the State could play a role. Meeting held last week with 
United Way and Resource Genesee to discuss options for residents who receive water 
shut off notices. 

b) Glenn Acres - water turn-on order from Judge Hayman 

c) Limited area boil-water notice 

d) General Motors Water Issues 

8) Messaging 

a) A plan is being developed to present to the community at-large and to the various interest 
groups (i.e. business, investors, foundations) the background of the financial emergency, 
the actions taken and next steps to emerge from receivership. This will be an on-going 
item for discussion. 


9) Recruitment and Selection of City Administrator/Manager 

a) Provide guidance on several considerations: duration of appointment, contract, consistent 
with TAB, working with TAB, etc. 

b) Emergency Manager is developing a recruitment and selection calendar; recruitment to 
begin September 1, 2014.

RE: PRESS RELEASE: Boil Water Advisory Lifted 


The boil water advisory was lifted yesterday while I was talking to John Gleason. The source has still not been 
identified and the plant and DECT are working to figure it. out. I told Gleason that, his suggestion to have 
contingency plans for these water events makes great sense but I had to look into the specifics of using the 
Guard and i would get back to him. This is more for DEQ. and the Guard to assist with at this time but please 
keep us posted on what the EM may share as far as updates.

For Immediate Release (Official Signed Notice to Follow) 


City of Flint Boil Water Advisory Lifted 


Flint, Michigan - September 9, 2014 The City of Flint’s Utilities Department and the DEQ have lifted both of the 
boil water advisories from this week for a western portion of the city. Testing results from all areas of the city 
confirm that the water is safe for all purposes. “The investigation into the cause of the boil water advisories 
continues,” said Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, “we will share the results from that investigation once it is 
available.”

Subject: ACTION NEEDED on Flint water documents 

Good afternoon Governor, 


Sorry for the quick turnaround time on this, but DHHS is hoping to issue the 
release this afternoon to avoid issuing news on Friday. The DHHS team has 
answered the questions and made significant revisions to the press release at my 
request. I think this is far more reader friendly and people focused. 


l 



Here are the specific answers to the questions: 


Do the elevated lead levels stick with a person for life? 

We do see blood lead levels decrease after education takes place and exposure to 
lead sources is reduced. The purpose of screening children for lead is to identify 
those with elevated levels. Removing potential sources of lead exposure and 
ensuring proper nutrition and healthcare leads to decreases in blood lead levels in 
follow-up testing, which is an important part of case management. Lead has a 
half-life in blood of approximately 25 days; in soft tissue, about 40 days; and in 
the non-labile portion of bone, more than 25 years. 


Why do the lead levels spike on a seasonal basis? 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during 
the third quarter of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the 
result of a number of factors including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil 
in the summer months. 


DHHS is requesting to issue this at 2 p.m. with Dr. Wells available to answer 
questions. 


['hank you for your consideration. 


Dave 


The notifications will be timed as follows: 


1:30 p.m. 

• Send final embargoed release and summary report to: 

o Genesee County Health Department - Geralyn Lasher 
o Dr. Mona Hannah- Attisha - Geralyn Lasher

o Task Force Members - Geralyn Lasher 
o City of Flint Mayor’s Office - Geralyn Lasher 
o Congress and legislature - Elizabeth Hertel 


2 p.m. 

• Issue press release and summary report 

• Post press release and summary report to MDHHS website newsroom and

So just to you-has it been decided that it is only our responsibility to fix? Is it mere 
resource request. Wouldn't the chair be the singular lead with the co-Vice chairs having 
some skin in the game? At the end of the day it will be important for the locals to buy in 
at the responsibility/programmatic level. I am new to the discussion so will yield to your 
expertise. Keith

The concern I have with having a local as a vice chair is that this is being 
pushed to the state level to fix. Similar to an emergency that reaches 
the state level, we need to have one lead to move this forward and that 
should be at the state level. I have run numerous state and federal 
disasters in this manner. The locals are pushing the request for 
resources to the state so this is them saying they cannot do anything 
more and handing this off to the state. This is one of the areas I 
mentioned that needs to stay consistent with the Emergency 
Management Act and how we manage incidents. 

Locals still have a voice in this (one way is that they are generating the 
requests for resources to assist).

Thanks for the opportunity to comment. I agree with Jim that it would 
be good to have a local entity at least be a co vice chair if possible. I 
would question statement of need wording and ask that it be reflect of 
the need for additional resources, integrated approach, additional 
professional expertise, enhanced communication, coordination and 
connection. ..you get the gist. Rich I would be happy to discuss at your 
convenience if appropriate. This would appear consistent with the 
request from Flint. Also in my limited (and I stress limited) discussions 
today I asked what success looked like and it included many of the 
suggested components. The individual I was speaking with wanted to 
further explore: 

Increased funding/focus for Head start to get ahead of the curve 
School nutrition and distribution systems (year around) 

Fresh produce/local foods 

Individual health screening 
Infrastructure improvements 

I know most if not all are identified in the outline but might want to 
further explain the nutrition component if the Docs in the group say it 
might be beneficial for those involved. 

Thanks again-Keith

Governor, this information was compiled by the Department of Treasury. 


l 






Summary 


In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc. (TYJT) to 
analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & Sewer Department (DWSD) or to 
join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The purpose of this study was to provide objective 
analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure future potable 
drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the City of Flint to 
provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were presented: These options ranged from 
the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, to 100% 
provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination 
of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report by TYJT in 
January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA's principal engineering firm regarding the others' conclusions and 
estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the Office of Financial Review (OFR) provided a comprehensive report to the State Treasurer analyzing 
three questions: 1) The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the projections provided by Flint/KWA 
were acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; and 3) Identification of the options Flint will utilize 
in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR recommended 
to the State Treasurer that KWA presented the best future option for future potable water. The OFR also concluded that 
KWA appeared to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee County appeared willing to assist 
the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA project could signify the beginning of better 
collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and the KWA project had both political and popular 
support. 

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and Flint officials. 
Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of the KWA project. In February 
2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron intakes. This bid opening represented the first 
meaningful step toward commencing construction of the KWA system. The bid was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain them as a 
customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, pending review of any final offer 
from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a "supply only" rate schedule. Only water treatment 
costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and operating revenue charges would 
be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand upon DWSD's Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also 
have the ability to construct and own its own transmission lines. 

The second option was a "full service" rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission services. 
Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no additional transmission 
rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to 
the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 


2 



Independent analyses of DWSD's final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of Environmental Quality 

(DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum annual rate 
increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 60 MGD of 
initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given "broadened representation," it is unclear exactly what 
this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to maintain its WTP for 
emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an adequate backup supply to meet their 
needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most expensive). 

DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total cost of this option was arrived 
at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not clear, so analysis 
proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. As such the Flint 

EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA 
presented the best future option for future potable water. The OFR also concluded that KWA appeared 
to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee County appeared willing to 
assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA project could signify the 
beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and the KWA project 
had both political and popular support.

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and 
Flint officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of 
the KWA project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron 
intakes. This bid opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the 
KWA system. The bid was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain 
them as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, 
pending review of any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a "supply only" rate schedule. Only 
water treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and 
operating revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand 
upon DWSD's Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own 
transmission lines. 

The second option was a "full service" rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be 
calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD's final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum 
annual rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 
60 MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given "broadened representation," it is 
unclear exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to 
maintain its WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an 
adequate backup supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total 
cost of this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not 
clear, so analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. 
As such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 


GOVERNOR’S OFFICE BRIEFING PAPER 
CITY OF FLINT DRINKING WATER 


What contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the city of Flint? 

A number of factors, not one specific cause, likely contributed to the Boil Water 
Advisories (BWAs) in the city of Flint during August and September 2014. While use of 
the Flint River has increased the amount of natural organic matter in the city’s water, the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has performed well above treatment requirements 
for organic carbon removal. In addition, less than 20 percent of the water system was 
included in the advisory area. If treatment had been compromised, detections would 
have been widespread throughout the city, rather than in such a localized area. 

The city’s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment 
and asset management. Most of the city’s over 550 miles of water mains are now over 
75 years old and constructed of cast iron piping. Cast iron pipe is subject to internal 
corrosion, called tuberculation, which causes buildup on the pipe interior, leading to 
water quality issues, reduced flow and pressures, and leakage. Tuberculation also 
encourages the development of biofilms, layers of bacteria that attach to the interior 
pipe wall. Biofilm growth is common in areas of piping with little or no disinfectant 
residual, and together with tuberculation can clog water lines to the point of insufficient 
water pressure. 

The city has also experienced decades of a declining user base and water use 
associated with vacant homes, commercial businesses, and industrial property. 

Declining water use leads to excess residence time within the city’s distribution pipes 
and water storage facilities, accelerating tuberculation, biofilm growth, and disinfectant 
residual degradation. While the city has recently seen an infusion of funding for blight 
removal, contractors completing this work have been improperly using fire hydrants, 
causing hydraulic disturbances that dislodged and suspended settled debris, which may 
have contributed to the bacterial contamination. 

The winter of 2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water system. The 
city, which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 30 percent, has seen even 
greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold weather-related water 
main breaks and leaks. The city lacks a formal maintenance program for its over 7,250 
valves, which would normally be used to limit impacts during break repairs. Two valves 
on the transmission line used to supply the area of the BWAs were found to be closed 
during the city’s investigation, causing longer residence time, reduced disinfectant 
residual, reduced flow, and reduced pressure. One of these valves has remained 
broken. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 2 


The BWAs also occurred during the warmest and, for 2014, relatively wet periods of 
August and September. Warm weather conditions are not only more conducive to 
bacterial growth but also degrade the water’s disinfectant residual carried out from the 
WTP more quickly. Longer residence times, biofilms, and tuberculation also contribute 
to disinfectant residual degradation. Warm wet weather conditions also allow water 
contaminated with bacteria to pool around piping with leaks and breaks. 

Process for Issuance and Cancelation of a Boil Water Advisory 

There are a number of conditions that can trigger BWAs. This includes the following: 

- Bacteria Monitoring Detections - Loss of System Pressure 

- Bacteria Standards Violations - Water Main Breaks 

- Treatment System Failures - Other Interruptions in Service 

- Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has developed a policy and procedure 
regarding BWAs to help guide staff, provide consistency, and maintain public health. A 
PDF of Policy and Procedure No. ODWMA-399-022 is being forwarded with this briefing 
paper. 

BWAs may be self-initiated by the water system, issued collaboratively in consultation 
with the DEQ, or when necessary mandated by the DEQ. Requesting customers to boil 
the water when bacterial contamination has occurred provides an added barrier of 
public health protection. 

The BWAs that recently occurred in the city of Flint were associated with bacteria 
monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards. These advisories were 
issued by the city of Flint collaboratively in consultation with the DEQ. 

Current regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water distribution 
systems were developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have been in 
effect since 1990, and were incorporated into the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended. There are a variety of bacteria, parasites, and viruses that 
can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them in drinking water. Testing 
water for each of these potential pathogens would be difficult and expensive. Instead, 
water systems test for total coliform and E.coli. Total coliform bacteria react to water 
treatment in a manner similar to many pathogens. Therefore, the presence of total 
coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or other 
contaminants to enter the system. The absence of total conforms in the distribution 
system minimizes the likelihood that pathogens are present. E.coli is itself a pathogen, 
and its detection would be direct evidence of a health risk. 

Once a BWA has been issued, time is needed to investigate potential causes and 
implement corrective measures. The larger the water system, the more time this may 
take. Once corrective measures have been taken, samples must be collected and 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 3 


analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present. Using the most common 
analytical method, samples must be incubated for a period of 24 hours before results 
can be obtained. In situations where the bacterial contamination has been confirmed, 
two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 hours apart are normally 
obtained before canceling a BWA. Adding each of these steps together, a normal 
response period to cancel a BWA under these circumstances would be expected to take 
at least 3 to 4 days. 

Recent History of the City of Flint Water System 

Historically, the city of Flint had been a customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) while simultaneously maintaining the Flint WTP to provide 
emergency backup service using the Flint River. The WTP performed quarterly test 
operations to maintain readiness and was utilized twice in 2009, supplying water once 
for 2 days and the other for 3 days. 

In April 2013 the city of Flint notified the DWSD that it would be terminating service in 
the future and contracting for raw water service from the Karegnondi Water Authority 
(KWA). Work on the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron broke ground in June 2013 and is 
expected to be completed with connection in late 2016. 

In August 2013 Rowe Professional Services Company completed an engineering 
proposal for improvements to the Flint WTP that would allow continuous operation of 
the WTP utilizing the Flint River in lieu of continuing service from the DWSD until 
completion of the KWA pipeline. In March 2014 the city of Flint entered into a Consent 
Agreement with the DEQ regarding the Flint WTP’s lime sludge facility. In April 2014 
the DEQ issued a construction permit for improvements to the Flint WTP. On April 25, 
2014, the city of Flint began continuous operation of the WTP, using water from the Flint 
River and discontinued the purchase of water from the DWSD. 

A BWA was issued for August 1 5-20, 201 4, for a portion of the city of Flint due to 
localized detections of total coliform and E.coli bacteria. Another BWA was issued for 
September 5-9, 2014, due to localized detections of total coliform bacteria in the same 
and adjacent portions of the city of Flint. The advisory covered an area of 
approximately six square miles. The city of Flint has a total land area of just over 
34 square miles. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 4 


While many of the BWA contributing factors listed above require long-term solutions, the 
city has taken operational steps to limit the potential for a BWA to reoccur. The city has 
increased flushing of water mains to limit residence time, maintain disinfectant residual, 
and help remove buildup and deposits within the piping. The city is boosting chlorine 
disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed. The city 
continues to investigate water leaks and water main breaks and the status and condition 
of system valves.

A Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Policy and Procedure cannot establish regulatory 
requirements for parties outside of the DEQ. This document provides direction to DEQ staff 
regarding the implementation of rules and laws administered by the DEQ. It is merely 
explanatory; does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public; 
and does not have the force and effect of law. 


INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, OR ISSUE: 

Community water systems are expected to provide customers with a continuous supply of water 
that meets both federal and state drinking water standards. However, there may be 
circumstances when the public must be notified that the water may not be safe. In these 
circumstances, a boil water advisory may be issued to prevent illness from known or suspected 
microbiological contamination. This policy is to provide guidance to Office of Drinking Water 
and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) drinking water program staff on advising community water 
system personnel when to issue and rescind a boil water advisory, the appropriate content, and 
the manner and method of delivery. 

AUTHORITY: 

Administrative rule R 325.10401a promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 

1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399), being Michigan Compiled Law 325.1001 et seq., requires 
public notification for violations of maximum contaminant levels and treatment techniques plus 
other situations as determined by the DEQ. Each public notice is required to state what actions 
consumers should take during a violation, which may include a statement recommending water 
customers boil all water used for consumption until further notice. 

In addition, R 325.1 1207 allows the DEQ to require the supplier of water to provide notice to 
customers or users that include any precautionary measures deemed necessary when an 
interruption in water service occurs, which could include low, zero, or negative pressure events. 

Furthermore, R 325. 1 2303 requires a supplier of water to include in their contingency planning a 
description of precautions or measures to be taken to protect the health of those customers or 
users that may be affected by an emergency. R 325.12304 also requires a supplier of water to 
notify the DEQ when an emergency is discovered and how the supply will notify its customers or 
users. While the content of this notification to customers or users may vary depending upon 
individual circumstances, each notification to customers or users must state what actions or 
precautions they should take, which may include a statement to boil ail water used for 
consumption until further notice.

STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT: 

DEQ staff met with Municipal Utilities Directors to seek input on issues that were subsequently 
addressed in this policy and procedure. 

DEFINITIONS: 

“Boil Water Advisory (BWA)” - A written or verbal advisory issued by the community water 
system or DEQ notifying the users of the water system that the water is or may be contaminated 
and advising them to boil the water prior to using it for drinking or cooking. 

“Community Water Supply (CWS)" - A public water supply (PWS) that provides year-round 
service to not fewer than 15 living units, or that regularly provides year-round service to not 
fewer than 25 residents. Examples include municipalities, such as cities, villages, and 
townships; apartment complexes; manufactured housing communities; condominiums; and 
nursing homes. 

“Complete Loss of Pressure” - Sustained negative pressures or pressure below five psi in any 
portion of a distribution system. It does not include instantaneous low or negative pressure 
occurring from pressure surges caused by pump cycling, valve operation, or other water 
hammer events, 

“Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)” - The maximum permissible level of a contaminant in 
water that is delivered to any user of a PWS. 

"Repeat Sample” - A sample that is collected and analyzed in response to a previous coliform- 
positive sample. 

“Routine Sample” - A water sample that is collected and analyzed to meet the monitoring 
requirements for total coliform, as outlined in the written sampling plan. 

"Tier 1 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 24 hours after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has significant potential to 
have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure. A Tier 1 
Public Notice also requires the supplier to initiate consultation with the DEQ as soon as practical 
but not later than 24 hours after the supplier learns of the violation or situation. Examples of 
these violations or situations include: 

1 . A violation of the Total Coliform MCL when fecal or E.coli are present in the distribution 
system; 

2. A violation of the treatment technique requirement resulting from a single exceedance of 
the maximum allowable turbidity limit; 

3. An occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak; 

4. A failure or significant interruption in key water treatment processes; 

5. A disruption of the water supply or distribution system; and

6. Other violations or situations as determined by the DEQ on a case-by-case basis. A 

violation or situation that requires a Tier 1 Public Notice also requires the supplier to consult 
with the DEQ to determine additional public notice requirements, including the timing, form, 
manner, frequency and content of the notice designed to reach all persons served, and any 
repeat notices or directions. At a minimum, one or more of the following forms of delivery 
must be used: 

a. Appropriate broadcast media: 

b. Posting of the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the area served by the system; 

c. Hand delivery of the notice to persons served by the system; or 

d. Another delivery method approved by the DEQ. 

Within 10 days of completing the Tier 1 Public Notice, the supplier shall submit to the DEQ a 
certification that it fully complied with the public notification requirements, including a 
representative copy of the type of notice distributed to persons served by the system and to the 
media. 

“Tier 2 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 30 days after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has the potential to have 
serious adverse effects on human health. Examples of these violations or situations include: 

1 . All violations of MCL, maximum residual disinfectant level, and treatment technique 
requirements except where the DEQ determines a Tier 1 notice is required. 

2. Violations of monitoring and testing procedure requirements, taking into account potential 
health impacts and persistence of the violation; and 

3. Failure to comply with a variance or exemption. 

For a Tier 2 Public Notice, the DEQ may, on a case-by-case basis, grant extensions in writing 
for up to three months from the date the supplier learns of the violation or situation, for reasons 
such as coordinating with billing cycles or if the violation or situation was quickly resolved and 
no longer poses any risk to the persons served. A Tier 2 Public Notice shall be repeated every 
three months as long as the violation or situation exists. A Tier 2 Public Notice and any repeat 
notices shall be in a form and issued in a manner that is reasonably calculated to reach persons 
served in the required time period. At a minimum, the notice shali be provided: 

1 . By mail or direct delivery to each customer receiving a bill and to other service connections 
to which water is delivered by the supplier, and 

2. By other methods reasonably calculated to reach other persons not receiving a bill, such as 
apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients and prison inmates. Other 
methods may include: 

a. Publication in a local newspaper 

b. Delivery of multiple copies to apartment complexes and manufactured housing 
communities 

c. Posting in public places or on the Internet 

d. Delivery to community organizations

“Treatment Technique (TT)” - Minimum treatment requirement or a necessary methodology or 
technology that is employed by a supplier of water for the control of the chemical, physical, 
biological, or radiological characteristics of a PWS. 

POLICY: 

A 8WA may be issued for a variety of reasons when microbial contamination is known or 
suspected. Total Coliform Rule (TCR) MCL violations, surface water TT violations, low or loss 
of pressure events, and waterborne disease outbreaks are circumstances when a BWA may be 
issued. Each of these situations is discussed in detail below. However, these situations are not 
the only times a BWA can or should be issued, Each incident must be handled on a case-by- 
case basis, using professional judgment to evaluate the circumstances in each situation. 

Finally, there may be situations when water systems experience contamination that is not 
microbial, but chemical due to a chemical spill or backflow due to a cross connection. In these 
cases, a notice to customers could include “Do Not Use” language since boiling the water may 
not remove the contamination. 

Types of Incidents: 

1 . Violation of a Drinking Water Standard 
a. TCR MCL Violations 

An acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of coliform 
organisms in both a routine and a follow-up repeat sample in the same monitoring 
period, and either analysis (routine or repeat) is also positive for fecal or E.coli. Because 
this MCL violation confirms the presence of a more direct connection to contamination, 
these violations warrant issuance of a BWA, unless there are unique circumstances. 

A non-acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of 
coliform bacteria in 2 or more samples in the same monitoring period for a supplier 
collecting less than 40 samples per month, or in more than 5 percent of the samples for 
a supplier collecting 40 or more samples per month, and the criteria for an acute 
violation did not occur, i.e., fecal coliform or E.coli were NOT detected present in either a 
routine or repeat sample. For example, a system that collects 5 samples per week for a 
total of 20 per month may have 1 sample report positive for total coliform or fecal I E.coli 
during the first week, but all repeat samples report negative for coliform. If another 
sample in a subsequent week also reports total or fecal/E.coli positive, but again, all 
repeat samples are coliform-negative, then a non-acute TCR MCL violation has occurred 
because 2 or more samples reported positive for coliform, but no fecai coliform or E.coli 
were detected in both a routine and a repeat sample.

Page 5 of 10 


When a non-acute violation occurs, staff should evaluate possible sources of 
contamination. If a source is identified that is considered likely to contribute disease 
causing organisms or result in water of questionable quality still being distributed, a BWA 
should be instituted. Examples of contaminant sources that would elevate the public 
health risk include, but are not limited to: 

• flooding of the wells 

• failure of the treatment system 

• recent construction activity in the distribution system 

• vermin (birds, rodents, etc.) activity in storage tanks 

• system-wide or extensive pressure loss in the distribution system 

Even if the source of contamination is not easily identified, a BWA may be appropriate 
for a non-acute TCR violation if the violation is widespread or ongoing. A BWA shall be 
instituted if monitoring indicates E. coli or fecal coliform contamination unless unusual 
circumstances warrant consideration, such as the absence of any coliform in repeat 
samples, or when staff are assured that the contamination has been eliminated before 
confirmation results are available. 

However, not every TCR MCL violation must result in a BWA, There may be a few 
exceptions when there is a TCR MCL violation but a BWA is not needed. For example, 
a violation may be declared in situations where samples collected on different days from 
widely dispersed locations report coliform present even though repeat samples do not 
show positive results. In this case, the sampling results may constitute a MCL violation, 
but a BWA may not be necessary. 

If a BWA is deemed necessary by the ODWMA, it should be issued as soon as possible 
but no later than 24 hours after the system learns of the violation. Because violation of 
an MCL results in required public notification (PN) per the PN Rule, the water supply 
may issue the PN and BWA simultaneously in one document (highly recommended) and 
must meet all the requirements of a Tier 1 PN and include BWA language. 

After measures have been taken to eliminate the source(s) of contamination, such as 
initiating or increasing chlorine feed rates and system flushing, additional sampling must 
be conducted. Raw water bacteriological sampling is also encouraged to eliminate the 
raw water as the possible source of contamination. For MCL violations, the BWA can be 
rescinded after the analyses of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the 
absence of coliform bacteria. The number of samples in each set should be a minimum 
of five samples, but can be decreased or increased based on system size or the extent 
of the affected area. Systems are encouraged to use routine sample sites if available 
and to use extra care if routine sites are not available.

b. Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) TT Violations 
SWTR TT violations include: 

• exceedance of turbidity standards at filter confluence point 

• failure to meet disinfection contact time requirements (C*T) 

• failure to meet disinfection residual standards 

Upon determination of an SWTR TT violation, ODWMA staff must determine if the 
violation poses a threat to public health. For example, if the turbidity levels at the filter 
confluence point were found to have exceeded 0.3 nephlometric turbidity units (NTUs) in 
95 percent of the samples in a two-month period, an SWTR TT violation has occurred. 
Based upon a review of plant performance and consultation with program managers, 
staff may determine that no significant health risk was posed and no BWA is necessary. 
However, the water supply must still issue a Tier 2 PN within 30 days of the violation. 

On the other hand, a BWA is likely to be necessary for a treatment plant that gets 
overwhelmed by excessive runoff and reports a turbidity level in excess of 1,0 NTU at 
the filter confluence point for a four-hour period. 

If the TT violation is ongoing or prolonged, or the ODWMA determines a significant 
public health risk is posed, ODWMA staff may elevate the PN to Tier 1 status, which 
must be issued within 24 hours and include BWA language. After appropriate measures 
have been taken to reduce or eliminate any health risk, additional monitoring must be 
conducted. Appropriate measures may include increasing coagulant dose, increasing 
chlorine residuals through the treatment plant, backwashing filters more often and 
flushing key system components. In this case, a BWA can be rescinded after analyses 
of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the absence of coliform bacteria. 
The number of samples in each set should be a minimum of five samples, but can be 
decreased or increased based on type and severity of the TT violation. 

Surface water plants utilizing conventional or direct filtration must add a primary 
coagulant under R 325.1 1008. Failure to add a primary coagulant is a violation of 
Act 399, and may also contribute to a TT violation under R 325.1061 1 (Filtration and 
Disinfection) which requires 3-log inactivation of giardia and 4-log inactivation of viruses. 
In these cases, ODWMA staff will have to determine if the violation poses a threat to 
public health and whether other actions are necessary, such as requiring a BWA. 

Factors to consider if a BWA is necessary would include chlorine residual concentrations 
throughout the treatment plant, raw water quality, C*T compliance, plus individual filter 
effluent and combined filter effluent turbidity levels. 

2. Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

Waterborne disease outbreaks can be declared by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Department of Community Health, a local health department, or other public 



OFFICE OF DRINKING WATER AND MUNICIPAL ASSISTANCE 
POLICY AND PROCEDURE 


Number: ODWMA-399-022 

Subject: Guidelines for Issuing Boil Water Advisories to

health institutions. If an outbreak is declared, the ODWMA will work with the declaring 
agency to ensure affected community public water supplies take appropriate measures to 
mitigate public exposure. These measures will include appropriate public notification, 
including instructions to boil water if appropriate. The ODWMA will allow the water supply to 
rescind the notification when the agency declaring the outbreak indicates it is safe to do so 
as the result of additional monitoring. 

3. Interruptions in Service 

a. Negative or Complete Loss of Pressure 

A complete loss of pressure or negative pressure in the distribution system must result in 
a BWA being issued to all water customers in the impacted area. After pressure is 
restored and the system recovers (tanks are filling and enough sources are operating to 
ensure pressures do not drop again), the affected area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples must be taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution 
system remains free of coliform contamination. The number of samples will vary 
depending on the size of the system and the extent of the area impacted. For very small 
systems that experience a power failure that results in a complete loss of pressure 
throughout the distribution system, a minimum of three samples should be collected. If 
applicable, chlorine residual measurements should be taken to ensure that an adequate 
disinfectant residual is present. If possible, chlorine dosages and residuals should be 
increased by 1 to 2 parts per million during this period as a corrective and preventive 
measure. If the first round of sampling does not detect coliform bacteria, the advisory 
may be rescinded. However, if the first round of sampling detects coliform bacteria, 
additional flushing should be conducted in the area where the positive coliform samples 
were collected and a second round of coliform samples collected from the area. The 
BWA should remain in effect until safe coliform sample results are obtained. 

b. Low Pressure Events 

Low pressure events might not result in a BWA. Low pressure is considered a drop in 
pressure below 20 psi but greater than 5 psi. A drop in water pressure in a distribution 
system could allow contamination to enter the water system through backflow by 
backpressure or backsiphonage. The decision to issue a BWA should be made on a 
case-by-case basis and be based upon professional judgment of all available data that 
may indicate the extent of the problem, such as: 

• Geographical extent of the pressure loss 

• Nature of the service area (residential vs. commercial/industriai) 

• Duration of the low pressure condition 

• Disinfection practices of the water system 

• Relative elevation differences in the service area 

• Status of the local cross connection control program

• Age and condition of the underground piping 

• Amount of underground piping located in areas of a high groundwater table 

• Ability and willingness of the operators to rapidly apply chlorine to the system or 
distribute an increased chlorine residual throughout the affected area 

After normal pressure is restored, the impacted area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution system is free 
of any bacteriological contamination. The collection of coliform samples after low 
pressure events is not absolutely required, but may be recommended based on the 
factors above. 

c. Water Main Breaks or Repairs 

A BWA may be issued during water main breaks and after the break has been repaired. 
Whether or not to issue a BWA will depend on the location and severity of the break and, 
more importantly, a decision based on sound engineering judgment that the integrity of 
the water system has been maintained. If at all possible, repairs should be performed 
under reduced or low pressure by closing the closest valves on each side of the break 
just enough to reduce the flow so the repairs can be made under pressure while the 
water flowing from the break is diverted away from the excavation to maintain clean 
sanitary conditions. If the water main can be repaired under pressure, and no 
nonpotable water, soil, or other potential contaminants entered the main during the 
break and repair process, then a BWA is not necessary. If the water main that was 
removed from service is flushed, disinfected, and sampled in accordance with AWWA 
Standard C651 before being placed back into service, a BWA does not need to be 
issued. 

If a water main break results in a complete loss of pressure before, during, or after the 
repair is made, a BWA must be issued to al! customers in the affected area. The BWA 
should remain in effect until the area is flushed, chlorine residuals are reestablished (if 
applicable), and sample results do not detect coliform bacteria. 

Content and Delivery of a BWA 


If the ODWMA determines a BWA is necessary, the water supply must issue the advisory as 
soon as practical, but not later than 24 hours after being advised to do so. The supply must 
make a good faith attempt to notify all customers in the affected area. Appropriate methods of 
distribution are situation specific, but may include radio or television broadcasts, hand delivery, 
and/or posting in conspicuous locations throughout the area. Delivery requirements as detailed 
in the PN Rule should be used to determine appropriate delivery methods. 

Although there are content requirements for public notification under the PN Rule, there are no 
requirements specific to boil water language. To ensure all appropriate information is 
transmitted to the customers, a BWA should include the same content elements as required for

POLICY AND PROCEDURE 


Number: ODWMA-399-022 

Subject: Guidelines for Issuing Boil Water Advisories to

Page 9 of 10 

public notification under the PN Rule. If a BWA is issued as the result of an MCL violation and 
the water supply issues the BWA in conjunction with the required PN (highly recommended), the 
content MUST meet all PN Rule content, delivery, and reporting requirements. 

The ODWMA boil water language is consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
policy that requires water be brought to a boil and allowed to boil for one minute before use. 

The language also suggests the use of bottled water as an alternative to boiling and describes 
the circumstances under which boiled or bottled water should be used. 

Staff should notify the appropriate local health department and the Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development, Food and Dairy Division, whenever a BWA is issued or rescinded. 
These agencies may receive calls from concerned customers or be involved in oversight of 
facilities impacted by the boil advisory and, therefore, need to be aware of the situation. 

Several BWA templates have been created and are available to ODWMA staff on the DEQ 
Intranet. To ensure consistency and inclusion of ail necessary content, these templates should 
be used as the basis for PNs and/or a BWA. Available templates include, but are not limited to: 

• Advisory for a TCR MCL. 

• Advisory for a low/no pressure event. 

• Notification for cancellation of a BWA. 

PROCEDURES: 

WHO I DOES WHAT 

Public Water Supply Notify DEQ of results in a timely manner as required by law and follow 

through with appropriate actions. 

District Staff Respond to all TCR and TT violations plus complete loss of pressure 

events in a timely manner and determine whether a BWA needs to be 
issued. 

• If needed, assist supply in drafting BWA and determining most 
appropriate method of delivery with approval from the District 
Supervisor. 

• If needed, assist the supply in determining actions to remove 
the possible contamination including steps needed to rescind 

the BWA. 

District Staff Provide on-site technical assistance for acute TCR MCL violations 

and other boil water situations as appropriate. 

District Supervisors Assist District Staff in the all matters pertaining to issuing a BWA.

ABCS 12 Investigates: What's In your water? 

Posted: Jan 29, 2815 3:38 PM EST 
Updated: Jafi 29, 2QT5 11 Mm EST 

By Larry Biiclt CONNECT 


FLINT (WJRT) - (01/29/1 5} - The results are- .m and we now have a completely indepen denOboK at what's in 
Fiini's water supply. 

For months, si nce Flint switched from a Detroit water supply to the Flint River as it’s water source, Flint water 
customers have complained of smelly, cloudy, bad tasting water and biame if for 3 variety of health: 
problems. 

CompSainte exploded earlier this month when Flint notified its water customers that a group of chemicals 
Known as TTHIV1 'were at much higher average levels than allowed by law, 

vyithr so many questions and distrust of the answers, ABpl2‘s Larry Elliott investigates - What's in your 
Water? 

it seems no matter who you ask . in the Flint area, there's a n opinion about the city's water. Mast of the issues 
center on the quality of the water and whether it's safe to drink, 

"Right now it smells," said Fit tit resident Lee Miller, "We're getting water out of our own back yard now arid it's 
costing me double what it was coming from Detroit. ' 

"it has a funny taste to it," said Flint resident Milton Alexander. 

"It could be dangerous to us, actually ! don’t know how dangerous it is," said Fiini resident Shariks Sanders., 

''I’m ha cheerleader for {he water department here, i think we've got a lot of issues to work on," Ken 
VanWagoner, of Good Beans Cafe - Flint, 

Most of the issues center. on the quality of the water and whether it's safe to drink, but concern over its safety, 
reached a new high earlier this month when the city was required by the state Department oi Environmental 
•Duality to notify residents that the water had exceeded the allowable li mit of a group of chemicals known as 
TTHM. 

TTHM is in most municipal water systems and is thought by some to be a possible carcinogen in. long term 
exposure. 

it's a byproduct. of chlonnatido, which is commonly used to help pudiy water, Last August, as- Flint's water 
treatment plant worked to purify the water it was drawing from the Flint River, levels of TTHM grew to weli 
over the EPA allowed maximum. 

August test results provided by the DEQ to ABC 12 show ail of the eight testing sites around Flint had TTHM 
levels well above, thg legal limit; 

The lowest level among the eight sites was .40 percent above the legal limit. The highest was 145 percent

more than allowed. 

DEQ rules only require the city to report higher than allowed levels to the public once a year, and only if the 
average of quarterly tests is higher than the legal limit 

That notification wentout to residents on Jan. 5. Since then, many residents have refused to believe 
assurances from the DEQ and the city that the water is now safe to drink. 

So, we set out to do complete and independent testing to find out for ourselves exactly what's in yourwater. 

It took a bit of research, but we finally found Water Tech, in Howell, a testing lab with absolutely no ties to 
Flint, just to make sure there are no questions about the test results. 

After having Water Tech train ABC12's Larry Elliott on the proper methods for collecting water samples, we 
set out last week to randomly test five sites in Flint. 

1. Downtown. 

"I'm excited to see this done because this is an independent way to find out that everything's just fine," 
VanWagonersaid. 

2. The north side. 

"We'd like to do kind ofa whole battery oftests of your water. Oh yeah," Alexander said. 

3. The west side. 

"It could be dangerous to us. How about if we help you find out what's in it right now?" Sanders said. 

4. The east side. 

"I'm hoping for a good test and put my family at ease," Miller said. 

5. Our main studio, on the south side. 

We also wanted to compare whatever we're to find with Detroit supplied water, so we took a sample from the 
Burton water system. 

Since next year Flint will connect to the new KWApipeline, getting its waterfrom Lake Huron, we tooka 
comparison sample from the Saginaw-Midland water system, which currently uses Lake Huron water. 

We tested all the sites for levels of TTHM. We also tested how much residual chlorine was in the Flint and 
Burton water supply and more importantly, we tested at two of our Flint sites for a number of other hazardous 
chemicals that could cause skin or other health problems. 

Tests for those other chemicals are not required for public water systems, but we decided to run those tests 
anyway. 

Here's what our independent testing shows: 

All sites tested, including the Saginaw-Midland water system and the Burton system, using Detroit water, 
contained TTHM - butall of them were well below the EPA allowed maximum. 

Saginaw-Midland water had less than a third of the maximum TTHM allowed, the Burton system had only 
about 25 percent ofthe maximum and the highest level found of all of our Flint tests showed just over 65 
percent of whafs allowed, all below EPA limits. 

A similar byproduct of chlorination, haloacetic acids, was also well below EPA maximums in Flint's water. 

We tested Flint’s north and east water samples for many other hazardous chemicals that a doctor told us 
could cause skin or other health problems, and on both tests, not a single one of those chemicals was 
detected. 

Since most often any smell to the water would be caused by levels of total residua! chlorine, we tested that 
too, in both our Fiintand Burton samples. 

The legal limit is 4 milligrams per liter. The average of our Flint samples shows a level of about a half 
milligram per liter. Our test in Burton actually shows 22 percent more residual chlorine than Flint. 

Our Flint sample also showed no Coliform bacteria. 

We asked Chris McCarthy, of Water Tech, a few questions.

Q: How would you describe these test results? 

A: "Well, for the samples received, the tests we performed, everything is within EPA guidelines for safe 
drinking water." 

Q: Is there anything in these results that raises a red flag for you? 

A: "For water quality or water safety, No.” 

We then asked residents if these results change their opinion of what they'll do with their water now. 

"To be honest, no," Alexander said. 

"It will make me feel a lot more comfortable about bathing and brushing my teeth in it, but I'm still not going to 
drink it and I'm not gonna give it to my kids or my dog," Sanders said. 

"It makes me feel a lot more safer, a lot more comfortable knowing that it's safe to drink now, you know. I'll tell 
you a load lifted off my shoulders. When the kids take baths, when my wife takes a shower, you know, I know 
now we're safe," Miller said. 

So what about those whoVe stood before Flint City Council with jugs of discolored water? 

While Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright points out he has no jurisdiction over Flint's water 
system, he says in general, discolored water like this is nearly always the result of water main breaks or 
repairs, and Flint has more than its share because of its aging system. 

Wright also says the KWA pipeline won't change that. It will take better management of repairs and money - 
lots of it- to replace Flint's aging water mains. 

Unfortunately for the city of Flint, those very high levels of TTHM recorded last August in Flint water tests are 
still required by the DEQto be included in the next report calculating average TTHM levels. 

The next test will be done next week, and city Public Works Director Howard Croft tells ABC12, because of 
the high levels last August, the city will again be found in violation and will be required by the DEQto send 
out another TTHM notice of violation to all Flint water customers in early March, even if all new tests show 
levels under the legal limit.

Subject: Backgrounder on Tuesday Flint water event 

Team, 

Here is background on the planned Tuesday event in Flint regarding the $2 million Distressed Cities grant and other 
issues connected to the water issue. 

There are plans for two press releases on Tuesday. The first will detail the two Flint grants and will be released by the 
governor's communications office. The other release, which would detail the other grants, would follow from Treasury 
with a quote from the governor. 

Mayor Walling has agreed to speak at the event, with Harvey Hollins and Dan Wyant representing the governor's office. 
Sen. Ananich has asked to speak, and it has been suggested that Rep. Neeley would speak and it might be better to add 
him to the program. Others, such as Deputy Director Workman and Emergency Manager Ambrose, would be present 
and available. 

The attached document includes details about the planned event, as well as background on the grants from Treasury 
and on the entire water issue from DEQ as well as Mayor Walling's Facebook post about the governor and links to the 
stories in the media about the issue. 

We have a room reserved and are working with the communications team in Flint to have microphones and other items 
needed for the event. 

Please let me know if there is any information you think should also be included, or anything that should be changed. 
Once everyone has had the opportunity to review, we can forward to the governor. 

Thank you, everyone, for your assistance. I know there are lots of moving pieces and many people involved.

City Of Flint Water History Facts 


Current Treatment Plant was put into service in 1954. 

Current 72" main pipeline was completed in 1970. 

Flint signed a 30 year contract with Detroit water and Sewer Department in the mid 1960’s. . 

The contract with DWSD has expired and we are currently operating on a yearly extension, 

In 2006 Flint completed a $48,000,000 upgrade of the existing Water Plant. (Required by the MDEQ & for backup only). 
Flint’s Water & Sewer System is approximately a 300,000,000 Enterprise. 

Flint’s Water & Sewer System is designed to deliver water to over 200,000 people with over 1,500 miles of infrastructure. 
Flint's most recent census count shows a population of approximately 102,000 in 2010. 

Flint’s census population in 2000 was approximately 124,000. 

The water system had over 45,000 customers in June of 1999. 

The water system had just over 36,000 customers by June 201 1 . 

The “Fixed Costs” that must be covered to maintain the system and deliver quality water have increased over 
time.

TO:: Flint City Residents 

FROM: Howard Croft, DRW Director 

RE; Water Questions 
DATE:; February 18, 2&1S 


Over recent weelts tfee City of Filnt has taken a number of measures to increase both 
the quality of water and the availability of information. Monthly Operating Reports are 
posted online approximately 15 days following the end of eaeh menili, a summa)*y 
report is also posted with additional information of utility functions, and the City has 
increased the level of testing being performed on the water, 

A nationally recognized vendor (Veolia North America) lias been contracted to provide 
a detailed overview of City procedures and to make recommendations where they see 
areas of improvements. 

The following questions and answers are provided for ail interested parties, and are 
intended to provide transparent, detailed, and updated information that is pertinent to 
the City of Flint's water system. 



Is it cu rrently safe to drink Oty of Fii nt water? 

Yes. Water from the City of Flint meets aft of the ERA regulator/ standards of the Safe Drinking 
water Act. 

rynYHA a. :ri8t&,se s^w::srsE£T,.e^stas,. puny rax is-m -ss-ms * 


What can you say about th 8 quality ? 

The City nf Hint is committed to providing high quality drinking water to residents and 
businesses in the immunity,: and has taken every precaution to ensure the water quality meets 
guidelines for safe drinking; water. To ensure that tap. water is safe to drink, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (ERA) prescribes^ which limit the amount of certain Gontamlnants 

In water provided by public water systems, in addition the Food and Drug Ad mi nistration 
regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled ’water, which must provide the same 
protection for pubfebealth. The Oty of Flint tap water meets the guidelines set by both entitles. 

What is considered to be a contaminant? 

Contaminants that may be present in water include microbial contaminants such as viruses and 
bacteria, and Inorganic contaminants; such as salts and metals, which can occur naturally. 

Pesti dd.es, herbicides,: organ ic chemical cs.nta rain ants and radioactive coutam Inants cou id a iso 
be present. 

it's important to note that drinking water, including bottied water may reasonably be expected 
to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. But the. presence of contaminants does 
not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk. 

Will these contaminants make people sick? 

The ERA requires that every ■wa.ter.re^ language addressing the fact drat some 

maS^Ittem more vulnerable to 
co ntanhnants in dri nking water (ha n the gene ra I popu laticn. 

A few examples are, an individual with a compromised immune system sucii as someone 
undergoing chemotherapy or an organ transplant a person with HiV/AIDs or other immune 
system disorders. Some elderly people and Infants can be particularly at risk from infections. 
These individuals and pa rents of i ofa fits s houid seek a dvi ce from thei r h ea ith provid e rs ; It's 
important to understand that this is the case with ail .public drinking water, it's not unique to 
water from the Flint River, 

How often does the City monitor water quality? 

The City monitor’s its water on a! daily basis to .assure: That: water .quality ■•remains within 
established guicieii nes. With the variances in water temperature, and the leakage and Infiltration 
problems arisingdue to failure of parts of thp distribution system, water quality did exceed, for a 
time, some of the established guidelines. This resulted in the issuance of the recent notices to 
the public. Once it was learned that some guidelines were not being met, the City's immediate 
focus was to bring water quality back within guidelines. The efforts taken to address non- 
compliance included increasing water flow through valve replacements and hydrant flushing and 
optimidng treatment processes. 

What were the causes of Increased levels of bacteria (including feeai) levels that f read about? 
Have (’he causes been sufficiently addressed? If not what needs to be done to prevent this from 
happening again? 

As is the case with most systems which treat surface water, many factors cootnbuted to; the 


environment which allowed bacteria to proliferate. One of the main. factor? in our case is. that 
when water travels through the 600 miles of the It will, at times, in 

certain areas of the city, reside in the system for different periods of time. Water purchased 
from the Detroit Water & Sewage Department is drawn front Lake Huron, chlorinated., and then 
it travels over SO miles to reach the City. By the time the water reaches Flint if ifptabie and 
capable of withstanding this typ.e-o.f residency time with thesystem. Water drawn from the Flint 
River, specifically in summer months when the temperature is fluctuating, is more susceptible to 
being impacted by variables such as high residency times snd increased chemicsi reaction. Over 
the recent three months the residency tirne of water in the system has been reduced to 
approxi rnateiy one week. 


The Department of Environmental Quality (DEO) requires that a minimum of 100 test?; be 
performed imcmthiy for chlorine residuals at various locations throughout the system. When 
residual levels are too low, it creates an environment in which bacteria such as fecal coilform can 
grow. After. switching soureesi.we encountered testings ifes; In tune 2014 that were consistently 
returrilhg low residual levels. Several of these sites became areas that total coilform was 
eventually detected and ultimately ''bail water” notices were issued. A significant, cause of this is 
attributed to aged infrastructure which Includes broken valves. 


The necessary repairs and adjustments have been made to. lb ring: bacteria to acceptable levels 
With the exception of one test site -- the 250.0 block of Flushing;. Road, Where low residua! levels, 
continue. The City expects and is actively searching for valve issues. The engineering firm l AM & . 
Potter Consulting Is working to develop a hydraulic mode! o? the distribution system and neve 
the ability to use unidirectional flushing that will assist in addressing areas where residua! .levels 
are low. 


I he City has done interna! tearing recently that shows all eight sites currently well underneath 
the Maximum Conta mi nant level and the next official testing date is due to the DEG. by March 
l s; , 2015. 

it . was recently announced in ; the news that Governor Snyder gave flint $ 2 nr? i Hion to fix the 
water problems? Is this true? 

Yes. fihd.er the state’s Finan ct ally Distr essed Cities, Villages and Townships Grant Program, Flint 
Was awarded $2 million to help address some of the problems associated with an aging water 
distribution system. While the City of Flint is very appreciative of the grant, it's going to take s 
SLibstarjf islly greateir amount to fully address the Improvements needed. 

The grant will cover two:signtf cepb, projects, one, to decommission the incinerator thdf will 
result in ~$400.,000 in savings annually to. the sewer fund and two, .3 complete leak detection 
performed on all of the large transmission mains in the City that, will reduce wafer loss, thereby 
cresting a savings in the water fund. 


This issue did not happen before the switch from Detroit water to flint water. Why now? 
Switching to the Flint River has hfgb.lightedkune^|r 0 «nidacoRsfeteTOiaS:in the distribution 
system that have existed for decades. Qvef the last few years, the City has engaged in the 
development of a more effective and consistent preventative maintenance program and a 
Capital Improvement Plan that will result In a mp.re reliable water distribution center over time.

Was it known: prior to the switch from Detroit water to Flint water that there would fee 
problems managing certain bacteria levels? 

It was understood that the flint River would, be subject t© variations due to temperature 
Changes;, rain events and would have higher orga.nid carbon, levels than Lake Huron water and 
would be more difficulty to treat. These facts were presented to and weighed by licensed staff, 
LAN engineering consultants and the DEQ. It was determined that Flint has the equipment and 
the capacity to meet the demands of treating river water. 

Sp in the ma|pr{ty of eases, it's safe to drinkfltot tap water? 

Yes, as safe it possibly can be. However ;f 3 person has a compromised immune system then 
he/she should consult with, her/his physician first, it is also safe ip hath and brush your teeth 
using the water. 

What about the "hardness"' of the water? 

The Flint River is a harder water source than water drawn from Lake Huron. Hardness is classified 
as having a. higher mineral content than "soft water", with ti re main concentration being calcium 
and magnesium. Water hardness is not considered, by the ERA to be a "health. : hazard. 

Water hardness/has been known to impact things such as cleaning tasks such as SPundry, 
dishwashing, bathing personal grooming, and has also been associated. with some farms Of skin 
Irritation such as eczema. 

What are the public reporting requirements for these sorts of problems, and has the City met 
those requirements? What asp fee done usdfe! information about a public 

health threat In timelier manner? 

The ERA 2010 "Revised Public Notification Handbook" has a specific breakdown of the elements 
required in public notifications and includes usable templates. The ERA Has three different. tiers 
associated with eompturiity water systems (CWS} : each with specific ti meframesrand 
requirements that trigger upon issuance of the violation. 

* Tier L CW'S must provide pyfelfcmotification within: 24:hourS;of a violation and continue this as 
directed by the primary agency. 

*■ Tier 2. CWS m ust provide pu blic notifi cation within 30 days of a violation and continue this 
every three months until the violation is resolved 

e- Tier f. C\¥$ roust provide; publt .•©pe.; yie^r..^ rt^’ ‘the*; : 6^A' : 
occurrences be provided in an annual notice 

The current violation is classified as a tier violation and was issued December 16.. 2014 . 

Besides the home notifications, where can I find official communications and any updates on 
the Flint water issue? 

THeiCify posts ih.fdfm.»tiQn^on..t-heC%©ff.Knt:wefesit® at ww w. vityoiTilntsC o m. There is a special 
section dedicated to addressing Flint water concerns and providing up-to-the-minute updates. In 



addition, updates can be found on Hint's Fscebook page and citizens may also caii the Flint 
Water Plant & Facilities at $10- 787-6537 with questions. 


If the water is ok to drink, why did stop, using the water? 

Genera! Motors has been A great partner to the city for many years and when they re cog ni. ted 
that a n : elevated level of chloride in the water was having an im pact on a specific machining 
process they requested permission to transfer water delivery for that specific process to Flint 
Township. This represents only 10% of the water purchased and used by 6M at the entire site. 
The remaining 90% of their water usage including all of the drinking water for 6M employees is 
stilt purchased from the City of Flint,

DATE: Match \4&\5 


An the Emergency Manager far the City of Flint, 1 am charged with .restoring- the City government 
to financial solvency, and working to assure that the City moves forward on a financially 
sustoindbie basis, difficult. Taxes and fees have 

been raised, sendees' and workforce reduced j and ongoing costs, incktdmg legacy costs, have been 
constrained. 

The' current controversy surrounding the pro vision of water, and the path for resolution, has a 
potentially significant impact on the progress that is being made. I am satisfied that: the water 
provided, to Flint users today i s within ail M0EQ and EPA guidelines, as evidenced by the most 
recent water quality results conducted for MDEQ. We have a continuing commitment to maintain 
water safety and to improve water quality, and have dedicated resources to assure this commitment 
will be made. 

The oft-repeated suggestion that the City should return to DWSD, even for a short period of time, 
would, in my judgment, have extremely negati ve ftnauciai consequences to the water system, and 
consequently to the rate; payers. By the most conservative estimates, such a move would increase 
costs by at least $1 2 million, annually, with that amount achieved only by eliminating virtually all 
budgeted, improvements in the system. For a system \vith Unrestricted Assets of only $740,745, 
according to the. June 30, 2014 audited financial statements, the only recourse within the. City’s 
control would be to increase revenues significantly. And in my judgment, that would come from 
raising rates for water by 30% or more . Further, changing the source of the city 's water would 
not necessarily change any of the aesthetics of the water, including odor and discoloration, since 
those appear to be directly related to the aging pipes and other inff astructure that carry water from 
the treatment faci lity to our customers.

This direction of discussion also deviates from what, in my judgment, should be the focus: How 
can we not only operate and maintain a system to assure the delivery of safe and quality water 
dependably, but significantly reduce the cost of water and sewer to the users? At an average of 
$149 per month for water and sewer service for a residential user, the cost is extremely high in 
comparison to surrounding areas, as well as most areas across the state, and creates a significant 
financial burden for many users. In my judgment, we should all be concentrating on how to reduce 
rates by 50% or more. Unfortunately, there are no easy or evident answers, and continuation of 
the status will be an impediment to the sustainable recovery of the City of Flint. It is a conversation 
that I expect we will have with the recently created Water Quality Advisory Committee. 

My reasoning for this conclusion is as follows: 

One of the decisions made in the context of beginning to eliminate deficits and to restore financial 
stability to the City of Flint was to increase water and sewer rates significantly - the only choice 
available to financially stabilize a system that as of June 30, 2012, had a deficit of $8,758,091. 
Another was to leave DWDS for the KWA because it offered the opportunity to lower future rate 
increases. A third decision was to utilize the Flint River on an interim basis when DWSD 
unilaterally terminated the City’s contract for water purchase. That decision was made because it 
also offered an immediate cost savings opportunity which translated into the ability to upgrade the 
Water Treatment Plant without having to seek financing. It was a reasonable decision because of 
our experience in using the river in a back-up capacity, including test runs on a quarterly basis for 
several decades. 

Unfortunately, the switch to the river as a primary source was more challenging than anticipated, 
and the harsh winter of 20 1 3-20 1 4 resulted in much more damage to the aging water infrastructure 
than in previous years. The result was the issuance of required notices that water exceeded 
established guidelines for safety as it could affect certain vulnerable populations, and some users 
of the system experienced unpleasant odors and discoloration. Some users also appeared to have 
had some negative reactions to the new source of water. However, as soon as the test results were 
known. City staff took immediate actions to address the concerns. These actions are evidenced 
today by the fact that MDEQ has certified that our most recent testing shows water from all testing 
sites to be well within acceptable guidelines. Additionally, the City is continuing to taking the 
necessary actions to assure that the water supply remains safe and that water quality continues to 
improve. 

As the City has moved to address the situation, the suggestion continues to be made that the City 
should re-engage with DWSD and purchase water at least until the KWA pipeline is supplying 
water. As evidenced by the most recent letter from DWSD, such a decision would immediately 
increase the City’s cost by $846,700 per month, or $10,160,400 per year, just for the fixed cost 
portion of the price. The actual purchase of water would be an additional fee, and dependent upon 



Wayne Workman 
March 3, 2015 
Page 3 


the quantity purchased. We estimate the actual water purchase cost to average more than $ 1 million 
per month, for a grand total of approximately $22 million per year. Finally, the DWSD offer is 
conditioned upon the City (or presumably the KWA) agreeing to negotiate a long term contract 
(30 years) for back-up. 

The $22 million annual estimate of increased costs to purchase water from DWSD would be 
minimally offset by an approximate $3 million in reduced operating costs, and could be further 
offset by an additional $9 million, but only if all funding for capital improvements to the system 
are eliminated. To eliminate all funding dedicated to repairing, stabilizing, and improving the 
system would be totally irresponsible and would have long term negative consequences to the City 
and to future rate payers. 


As you are aware we have recently brought in outside expert assistance to evaluate the steps we 
have taken to assure that the water is safe and to continue to improve water quality. We are 
expecting specific recommendations within the next few weeks, and are committed to 
implementing those recommendations in a timely manner. Many steps have already been taken. I 
am confident that implementing their recommendations will assure a continuing supply of safe 
water as well as improved quality, and at far less cost than re-engaging DWSD. 

We have also created a 40-member Water Advisory Committee and a 13-member Technical 
Advisory Committee to assure two-way communication with the public and users of the system. 
Those committees will begin to meet this week, and we look forward to answering their questions 
and receiving their input. 

It is unfortunate that problems and concerns with quality have arisen, and we are working every 
day to address the issues that caused them. Maintaining safe water and improving quality is a top 
priority as we work to make the City of Flint an attractive place to live, work, study, and play.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 

jJjjjk WARNING! For your safety, the information in this manual must be followed to minimize 
the risk of electric shock, property damage or personal injury. 


A DANGER: 

Electric Shock Hazard: 

install metal ground clamp to metal house 
water supply pipe before beginning 
installation. Securely tighten connection in 
center of metal ground damp. Failure to do 
so can result in death or electric shock, 

is: Check and comply with your state and local 
codes. You must follow these guidelines. 

ss Use care when handling the water softening 
system. Do not turn upside down, drop, drag or 
set on sharp protrusions, 

ss Water softening systems using sodium chloride 
(salt) for recharge add sodium to the water. 
Persons on sodium restricted diets should 
consider the added sodium as part of their 
overall intake. Potassium chloride can be used 
as an alternative to sodium chloride in your 
softener. 

ss Use only lead-free solder and flux for all sweat- 
solder connections, as required by state and 
federal codes. 

ss This water softening system must be properly 
installed and located in accordance with the 
installation instructions before it is used, 
ss Keep the salt hole cover in place on the softener 
unless servicing the unit or refilling with salt 

In the state of California: You must turn the 
Salt Efficiency Feature setting to ON. This may 
initiate more frequent recharges. However it 
will operate at 4,000 grains per pound of salt or 
higher. To turn on the Salt Efficiency Feature, 
follow the instructions in the "Salt Saver" 
section of this manual 


A WARNING: Do not use with water 

that is microbioiogically unsafe or of unknown 
quality without adequate disinfection before 
or after the system. 

A WARNING: Discard ail unused 

parts and packaging material after 
installation. Small parts remaining after the 
installation could be a choke hazard. 

® The water softening system works on 24 volt- 
60 Hz electrical power only. Be sure to use the 
included external power supply. 

ss External power supply must be plugged into an 
indoor 120 volt, grounded outlet only. 

ss Use clean water softenina salts only, at least 
99.5% pure. NUGGET, PELLET or coarse SOLAR 
salts are recommended. Do not use rock, block, 
granulated or ice cream making salts. These 
types of salts may contain dirt and sediments 
that might mush or cake, creating maintenance 
issues for the water softener, 

ss Avoid installing in direct sunlight, Excessive 
heat may cause distortion or other damage to 
non-metallic parts. 

ss If installing the water softener outdoors, do 
not locate where it will be exposed to wet 
weather, direct sunlight, extreme hot or cold 
temperatures, or other forms of abuse.

This mode! is efficiency rated. The efficiency rating is valid only at the minimum stated salt dose. The softener has a demand 
initiated regeneration iD.I.R.) feature that complies with specific performance specifications intended to minimize the amount 
of regenerant brine and water used in Its operation. 

The softener has a rated salt, efficiency of not less than 4.000 grains of total hardness exchange per pound of salt (based on 
sodium chloride), and shall not deliver more salt than its listed rating or be operated at a sustained maximum service flow 
rate greater than its listed rating. This softener has been proven to deliver soft water for at least ten continuous minutes at 
the rated service flow rate. The rated salt efficiency is measured by laboratory test described in NSF/ANSI Standard 44. These 
tests represent the maximum possible efficiency that the system can achieve. Operational efficiency is the actual efficiency 
after the system has been installed. It is typically less than the efficiency, due to individual application factors including water 
hardness, water usage, and other contaminants that reduce the softener's capacity.

SERVICE 

When the water softening system is providing 
soft water, it is called "Service. 1 ' During service, 
hard water flows from the house main water pipe 
into the water softening system. Inside the water 
softening system resin tank is a bed made up of 
thousands of tiny, plastic resin beads. As hard 
water passes through the bed, each bead attracts 
and holds the hard minerals. This is called ion- 
exchanging. It is much like a magnet attracting 
and holding metals. Water without hard minerals 
(soft water) flows from the water softening system 
and to the house pipes. 


After a period of time, the resin beads become 
coated with hard minerals and they have to 
be cleaned. This cleaning is called recharge. 
Recharge is started at 2:00 AM (factory setting) by 
the water softening system control, and consists 
of five stages or cycles. These are FILL, BRINING, 
BRINE RINSE, BACKWASH and FAST RINSE. 


AUTOMATIC HARD WATER BYPASS DURING 
RECHARGE 

During recharge the water softener is 
automatically put in bypass mode allowing hard 
water to be available to the home. Once the 
softener is recharged water is directed back 
through the softener to be conditioned. 


However, you should avoid using HOT water 
because the water heater will fill with the hard 
water. 


FILL 

Salt dissolved in water is called brine. Brine is 
needed to clean the hard minerals from resin 
beads. To make the brine, water flows into the salt 
storage area during the fill stage. 

BRINING 

During brining, brine travels from the salt storage 
area into the resin tank. Brine is the cleaning agent 
needed to remove hard minerals from the resin 
beads. The hard minerals and brine are discharged 
to the drain. 

The nozzle and venturi create a suction to move 
the brine, maintaining a very slow rate to get the 
best resin cleaning with the least salt, 

BRINE RINSE 

After a pre-measured amount of brine is used, 
the brine valve doses. Water continues to flow in 
the same path as during brining, except for the 
discontinued brine flow. Hard minerals and brine 
flush from the resin tank to the drain. 


BACKWASH 

During backwash, water travels up through 
the resin tank at a fast flow rate, flushing 
accumulated iron, dirt and sediments 
from the resin bed and to the drain. 

FAST RINSE 

Backwash is followed by a fast flow of water down 
through the resin tank. The fast flow flushes brine 
from the bottom of the tank, 
and packs the resin bed. 

After fast rinse, the water softening system returns 
to soft water service.

NORMAL OPERATION, CONTROL DISPLAYS 

During normal operation, the present time of 
day and AM or PM and DAYS TO EMPTY show 
in the control display area. 

The system will automatically recharge at the 
preset recharge time as needed. 


FEATURE: OPTIONAL RECHARGE CONTROLS 

Sometimes, a manually started recharge may 
be desired or needed. Two examples: 

m You have used more water than usual (house 
guests, extra washing, etc,! and you may run 
out of soft water before the next recharge. 

** The system ran out of salt. 

Use one of the following features to start a 
recharge immediately, or at the next preset 
recharge start time. 


RECHARGE TONIGHT 

Touch (do not hold) the RECHARGE button. 
RECHARGE TONIGHT flashes in the control display 
area. A recharge will occur at the next preset 
recharge start time. If you decide to cancel this 
recharge, touch the same button once more. 

RECHARGE NOW 

Press ana hold the RECHARGE button until 
RECHARGE NOW starts to flash in the control 
display area. The water softening system begins 
an immediate recharge and, when over in about 
two hours, you will have a new supply of soft 
water. Once started, you cannot cancel this 
recharge. 


FEATURE: MEMORY 

If electrical power to the water softening system is 
interrupted, the control display is blank, and the blue 
indicator light is off, but the control keeps correct 
time for 24 hours. When power is restored, you have 
to reset the present time only If the display and blue 
indicator light are flashing. All other settings are 
maintained and never require resetting unless a 
change is desired. 


If the time is flashing after a long power outage, 
the water softening system continues to work as 
it should to provide you with soft water. However, 
recharge may occur at the wrong time of day until 
you reset the control to the correct time 
of day. 


FEATURE/SERVICE: AUTOMATIC 
ELECTRONiC DIAGNOSIS 

The control computer has a self-diagnostic 
function for the electrical system (except input 
power and water meter). The computer monitors 
the electronic components and circuits for correct 
operation. If a malfunction occurs, an error code 
appears in the control display.

WATER CONDITION INFORMATION 
IRON 

Iron in water can cause stains on clothing and 
plumbing fixtures, It can negatively affect the 
taste of food, drinking water, and other beverages. 
Iron in water is measured in parts per million 
(ppm). The total* ppm of iron, and type or types*, 
is determined by chemical analysis. Four different 
types of iron in water are: 

1 Ferrous (clear water) iron 
1 Ferric (red water) iron 
H Bacteria! and organically bound iron 
ft Colloidal and inorganically bound iron (ferrous 
or ferric! 

Ferrous (clear water) iron is soluble and dissolves 
in water. This water softener will reduce 
moderate amounts of this type of iron (see 
specifications)** Ferrous (clear water) iron is 
usually detected by taking a sample of water In 
a clear bottle or glass. Immediately after taking, 
the sample is clear. As the water sample stands, 
it gradually clouds and turns slightly yellow or 
brown as air oxidizes the iron. This usually occurs 
in 15 to 30 minutes. 

When using the softener to reduce Ferrous (clear 
water! iron, add 5 grains to the hardness setting 
fore very 1 ppm of Ferrous (clear water) iron. See 
"Set Water Hardness Number" section. 

Ferric (red water), and bacterial and organically 
bound irons are insoluble. This water softener 
will not remove ferric or bacterial iron. This iron 
is visible immediately when drawn from a faucet 
because it has oxidized before reaching the 
home. It appears as small cloudy yellow, orange, 
or reddish suspended particles. After the water 
stands for a period of time, the particles settle to 
the bottom of the container. Generally these irons 
are removed from water by filtration. Chlorination 
is also recommended for bacterial iron. 


Colloidal and inorganically bound iron Is of ferric 
or ferrous form that will not filter or exchange 
out of water. This water softener will not remove 
colloidal iron. In some instances, treatment 
may improve colloidal iron water. Colloidal iron 
water usually has a yellow appearance when 
drawn. After standing for several hours, the color 
persists and the iron does not settle, but remains 
suspended in the water, 

SEDIMENT 

Sediment is fine, foreign material particles 
suspended in water. This water softener will not 
remove sediment. This material is most often clay 
or silt Extreme amounts of sediment may give 
the water a cioudy appearance. A sediment filter 
installed upstream of the water softener normally 
corrects this situation. 

* Water may contain one or more of the four 
types of iron and any combination of these. Total 
iron is the sum of the contents. 

** Capacity to reduce clear water iron is 
substantiated by WQA test data. 

CHLORINE 

Softener resins may degrade in the presence 
of chlorine above 2 ppm. If you have chlorine 
in excess of this amount, you may experience 
reduced life of the resin. In these conditions, you 
may wish to consider purchasing a GE point-of- 
entry household filtration system with a chlorine 
reducing filter.

BEFORE YOU START 

555 The water softener requires a minimum water flow of 3 gallons per minute at the inlet. Maximum 
allowable inlet water pressure Is 125 psi. If daytime pressure is over 80 psi. nighttime pressure may 
exceed the maximum. Use a pressure reducing valve If necessary (Adding a pressure reducing valve 
may reduce the flow). If your home is equipped with a back flow preventer, an expansion tank must 
be installed in accordance with local codes and laws. 

£55 The water softener uses a direct plug-in external power supply (included). Be sure to use the included 
power supply and plug it into a nominal 120V, 60 cycle household outlet that is in a dry location only, 
grounded and properly protected by an over current device such as a circuit breaker or fuse. 

555 Do not use this system to treat water that is microbiologically unsafe or of unknown quality without 
adequate disinfection upstream or downstream of the system,

LOCATION REQUIREMENTS 

Consider all of the following when selecting an 
installation location for the water softener. 

® Do not locate the water softener where freezing 
temperatures occur. Do not attempt to treat 
water over 120°F. Freezing temperatures or 
hot water damage voids the warranty, 
ss To condition ail water in the home, install 
the water softener close to the water supply 
inlet, and upstream of all other plumbing 
connections, except outside water pipes. 

Outside faucets snould remain on hard water to 
avoid wasting conditioned water and salt. 

® A nearby drain is needed to carry away 
regeneration discharge (drain! water. Use a 
floor drain, laundry tub, sump, standpipe, or 
other optionsjcheck your local codes). See 
"Air Gap Requirements" and "Valve Drain 
Requirements"sections.

weight of the tank, when full of water and salt, 
may cause the tank to fracture at the shim. 


NOTE: Be sure all 3 tabs of the clip go through the match- 
ing holes on the water softener valve inlet or outlet, and 
fully into the channel on the single bypass valve. Make sure 
that the tabs are fully seated. 


COMPLETE INLET AND OUTLET PLUMBiNG 

A WARNING! 

ELECTRICAL SHOCK HAZARD: 
install metal ground damp to metal house 
water supply pipe before beginning installation. 
Securely tighten connection in center of metal 
ground damp. Failure to do so can result in 
death or electrical shock. 


* Secure ground damp to metal pipes. 

Measure, cut, and loosely assemble pipe and 
fittings from the main water pipe to the inlet and 
outlet ports of the water softener valve. Be sure 
to keep fittings fully together, and pipes squared 
and straiaht BE SURE INCOMING HARD WATER 
SUPPLY IS DIRECTED TO THE SOFTENER VALVE 
INLET PORT. 

NOTE: Inlet and outlet are marked on the water 
softener valve. Trace the water flow direction to 
be sure hard water Is to inlet. 

IMPORTANT: Be sure to fit, align and support 
all plumbing to prevent putting stress on the 
water softener valve inlet and outlet. Stress from 
misaligned or unsupported plumbing may cause 
damage to the valve. 

* If making a soldered copper installation, do all 
sweat soldering before connecting pipes to the 
NPT adapters and bypass valve. Torch heat will 
damage plastic parts. 


A WARNING! 

If solder is used to make pipe connection 
use only lead free solder and flux to 
prevent lead poisoning. 

» When turning threaded pipe fittings onto plastic 
fittings, use care not to cross-thread. 

* Use Teflon Tape on all external pipe threads. 
Complete the inlet and outlet plumbing for the 
type of pipe you will be using. Secure ground 
clGmpto metal pipes.

1. Measure, cut to needed length and connect the 
3/8" drain line (provided) to the salt storage tank 
overflow elbow and secure in place with a hose 
clamp. 

2. Route the hose to the floor drain, or other 
suitable drain point no higher than the drain 
fitting on the salt storage tank (This is a gravity 
drain). If the tank overfills with water, the 
excess water flows to the drain point. Cut the 
drain line to the desired length and route it 
neatly out of the way. 

IMPORTANT: For proper operation of the water 
softener, do not connect the water softener valve 
drain tubing to the salt storage tank overflow hose. 


TEST FOR LEAKS 

To prevent air pressure in the water softener and 

plumbing system, complete the following steps in 

order: 

1. Fully open two or more softened cold water 
faucets close to the water softener, located 
down stream from the water softener. 

2. Place the bypass valve (single or 3 valve) into 
the"bypass" position (see Figures ori Page 10). 

3. Slowly open the main water supply valve. Run 
water until there is a steady flow from the 
opened faucets, with no air bubbles. 

4. Place bypass valve(s) in "service" or soft water 
position as follows: 

• Single bypass valve (Figure 4): Slowly move 
the valve stem toward "service." pausing 
several times to allow the water softener to 
fill with 'water. 


• 3 valve bypass (Figure 5): Fully close the 
bypass valve and open the outlet valve. 
Slowly open the inlet valve, pausing several 
times to allow the water softener to fill with 
water. 


5. After about three minutes, open a hot water 
faucet until there is a steady flow and there are 
no air bubbles, then close this faucet. 


6. Close all cold water faucets and check for leaks 
at the plumbing connections that you made. 

7. Check for leaks around clips at softener's 
inlet and outlet If a leak occurs at a clip, 
depressurize the plumbing (turn off the water 
supply and open faucets) before removing clip. 
When removing clips at the softener's inlet 

or outlet, push the single bypass valve body 
toward the softener (See Figure 14), Improper 
removal may damage clips. Do not reinstall 
damaged clips.

ADD WATER AND SALT TO THE SALT 
STORAGE TANK 

A WARNING! 

“ EXCESSIVE WEIGHT HAZARD: 

Use two or more peopie to move and lift 
salt bags. Failure to do so can result in 
back or other injuries, 

1. Using a container, add about three gallons of 
clean water into the salt storage tank. 

2. Add salt to the storage tank. Use nugget, 
pellet or coarse solar salts with less than 1% 
impurities. 

PLUG IN THE WATER SOFTENER 

1. Plug the water softener into an electrical outlet 
that is not controlled by a switch. 

2. Replace the top cover. 

3. Replace the salt hole cover. 

NOTE: The water heater is filled with hard 
water and, as hot water is used, it will refill 
with conditioned water. In a few days, the hot 
water will be fully conditioned. To have fully 
conditioned hot water Immediately, wait until 
the initial recharge Is over. Then, drain the water 
heatertfollowing instructions for water heater) until 
water runs cold. 

4 WARNING! Discard a!! unused parts 

and packaging material after installation. 
Small parts remaining after the installation 
could be a choke hazard. 


SANITIZE THE WATER SOFTENER /SANITIZE 

AFTER SERVICE 

1. Open salt hole cover, remove the brineweil cover 
and pour about 3 oz. (6 tablespoons) of household 
bleach into the softener brineweil. Replace the 
brineweil cover. 

2. Make sure the bypass valve(s) is in the 
"servicelopen) position, 

3. Start a recharge (regeneration). See "Start a 
Recharge"on Page 18. 

4. After the recharge has completed, fully open a 
coid water faucet, downstream from the softener, 
and allow 50 gallons of water to pass through 
the system. This should take at least 20 minutes. 
Close the faucet.

display shows the present time of day and 
DAYS TO EMPTY. 



DAYS TO EMPTY 

The words DAYS TO EMPTY and a number are 
shown in the lower half of the display. This 
information is shown in the normal run display. 
This is to inform the user of the number of days 
before the salt level in the brine tank reaches 
Level 0. There will be salt left in the salt tank, but it 
may not be sufficient to fully recharge the system. 
Salt should be added at this time to avoid hard 
water. The value is updated daily and whenever 
the SALT LEVEL value is changed. 



NOTE: For the first several weeks of operation, the 
DAYS TO EMPTY may provide erratic operation, 
For example, the blue indicator light may flash, 
showing that more salt is required when the 
actual salt levei in the tank is well above the Level 
0. In some cases, the DAYS TO EMPTY may even 
increase over a several week period. 

It takes a couple of months for the water softener 
to learn your water usage pattern. Once it does 
this, it will accurately determine actual salt usage 
pattern. During this first period, check salt level 
when blue indicator light flashes, If the salt level 
in the tank is at Level 1 or above, allow system to 
run. Be sure to reset your salt level indicator each 
time you add salt to the system. 

START A RECHARGE 

Press the RECHARGE button and hold for three 
seconds, until "RECHARGE NOW" begins to flash 
in the display, starting a recharge, this recharge 
draws the sanitizing bleach or brine into and

POWER OUTAGE MEMORY 

If electrical power to the water softener is lost, 
"memory" built into the timer circuitry will keep 
all settings for up to 24 hours, While the power 
is out, the display is blank and the water softener 
will not regenerate. When electrical power is 
restored, the following will occur: 

Reset the present time only if the display is 
flashing. The HARDNESS and RECHARGE TIME 
never require resetting unless a change is desired. 
Even if the clock is incorrect after a long power 
outage, the softener operates as it should to keep 
your water soft. However, regenerations may 
occur at the wrong time of day until you reset the 
clock to the correct time of day. 

NOTE: If the water softener was regenerating 
when power was lost, it will now finish the cycle. 


ERROR SIGNALS 

If there is an error code 
detected, the blue 
indicator light will flash 4 
times every second, the 
display will flash Err and 
the alarm will beep every 
30 seconds (from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM) to signal 
that the softener requires service. The alarm can 
be turned off by pressing any button, but the blue 
indicator light and display will continue to flash. 



Disconnect the transformer from the wall outlet 
momentarily, and plug it back in. The normal 
display will appear. The motor may run for several 
minutes, as the unit resets. If the problem is 
not corrected, the error code will reappear in 
8 minutes. See the Before you Call for Service 
section to assist in troubleshooting the water 
softener. 


BLUE iNDICATOR LIGHT 

Steady blue light indicates that the unit is working 
correctly. The light flashes when the unit needs 
attention from the user. 

* Light will also flash when power to until has 
been interrupted. Check the PRESENT TIME 
setting. 

* Light, flashes and DAYS TO EMPTY flashes - 
check salt level and add salt as required. 

* Light flashes and Err Is in the display - electrical 
problem with system. 


LOW SALT SIGNAL 

When the DAYS TO EMPTY drops to 15, the blue 
indicator light and DAYS TO EMPTY in the display 
will flash every second and the alarm will beep 
every 30 seconds (from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM), to 
notify the user that the unit is running low on 
salt. As soon as any button is pressed, the alarm 
will stop beeping. The blue indicator light and 
DAYS TO EMPTY will continue to flash. Once salt 
is added to the brine tank and the SALT LEVEL is 
reset, the DAYS TO EMPTY will be reset. 




ADJUSTING VOUR WATER HARDNESS 

The blend adjusting knob (Figure .16) gives the 
ability to finely adjust hardness of the treated water 
leaving the water softener. If slightly harder water 
is desired than is normally delivered by the water 
softener, the blend adjusting knob can divert a small 
stream of hard water and blend it with the soft water 
entering the home. The amount of water diverted is 
controlled by turning a blend adjusting knob on the 
end cap of the valve stem. 

NOTE: To get full performance from your water 
softener leave blending valve in the factory closed 
position. 

To make adjustments to water hardness: 

1. Hold bypass handle to keep the valve stem 
from rotating (see figure 16). Loosen hex nut on 
blend adjustment knob by turning the hex nut 
counterclockwise. 

2. TO INCREASE HARDNESS: With the bypass in 
the service position (see figure 16) hold the handle 
to keep the valve stem from rotating and turn the 
blend adjusting knob counterclockwise up to 2 
turns from the closed position. It Is recommended 
that adjustments be made In quarter turn 
Increments over several weeks until the desired 
hardness is achieved. NOTE: Once an adjustment 
is made to the blend valve knob the change in 
water hardness at the homes faucets or shower 
heads may take several days to be noticed. This 
delay is due to the large amounts of already 
conditioned water in the pipes and water heater 
that must be exchanged before a change in 
hardness can be noticed. Have the wafer tested 
to determine the actual water hardness. 

3. TO DECREASE HARDNESS: With the bypass in 
the service position (see figure 16) hold the handle 
to keep the valve stem from rotating and turn the 
blend adjusting knob clockwise. When the knob 
will not turn anymore, hard water is no longer 
being blended into the soft water. 

4. Once the desired hardness is achieved tighten the 
hex nut (see figure 16) clockwise until it comes in 
contact with the bypass stem. 

NOTE: To meet the water softener performance 
specifications and reduction of barium and radium 
claims the adjustable hardness must be kept in 
the “OFF" position. The off position is achieved 
when the blend adjusting knob is fully rotated 
clockwise until it stops.

CHECKING THE SALT STORAGE LEVEL and 
REFILL 

Brine (salt dissolved in water! is needed for each 
and every recharge. The water for making brine 
is metered into the salt storage area by the water 
softening system valve and control, However, you 
must keep the tank supplied with salt. 

ADDING SALT 

Lift the salt hole cover and check the salt storage 
level frequently. If the water softener uses all 
the salt before you refill it, you will experience 
hard water. Until you have established a refilling 
routine, check the salt every two or three weeks. 
Always add if less than 1/4 full. Be sure the 
brinewell cover is on. 

NOTE: if using potassium chloride (KCI), do not fill 
above level 4 on the brinewell decal. 

NOTE: In humid areas, it is best to keep the salt 
storage level lower, and to refill more often to 
avoid salt "bridging". 

Recommended Salt Nugget, pellet or coarse 
solar salts with less than 1% impurities. 

Salt Not Recommended: Rock salt, high in 
impurities, block, grandulated table, ice melting, 
ice cream making salts, etc. 

^CAUTION: 

Water softening salt with iron removing 
additives: 

Some salts may have an additive to help the 
water softening system handle iron in the 
water supply. Although this additive may 
help to keep the water softening system 
resin clean, it may also release corrosive 
fumes that weaken and shorten the life of 
some water softening system parts. 


CLEANING IRON OUT OF THE WATER 
SOFTENING SYSTEM 

Your water softening system takes hardness 
minerals (calcium and magnesium) out of 
the water. Also, it can control some (see the 
Specification Guidelines section! "clear water" iron. 
With clear water iron, water from a faucet 
is clear when first put into a glass. After 15 to 30 
minutes, the water begins to cloud or turn rust 
colored. A water softening system will not remove 
any iron that makes the water cloudy 
or rusty as it comes from the faucet (called red 
water iron). To take red water iron out of water, 
or over the maximum of clear water iron, 
an iron filter or other equipment is needed, 

GE recommends using Super Iron Out 0 to clean 
your resin bed if your iron content is high. Use 
Super Iron Out® with every 40ib. bag of salt as 
preventative maintenance against rust build up. 
Clean the bed at least every six months, or more 
often if iron appears in the soft water between 
cleanings. 

IMPORTANT: It is important to mix the resin bed 
cleaner with water (following the manufacturer's 
instructions), pour it into the brineweSH see Figure 
9) and recharge the softener immediately. Do not 
pour the resin bed cleaner 
in with the salt, as it will not be as effective in 
cleaning the resin, and can cause damage to 
the softener if it is left in the brine tank for an 
extended period due to the corrosive gases 
that are formed. 


23 



CLEANING THE NOZZLE AND VENTURI ASSEMBLY 
A clean nozzle and venturi is needed for the water 
softening system to work properly. This small 
unit makes the suction to move brine from the salt 
storage area to the resin tank during recharge. If 
it becomes plugged with sand, dirt, etc., the water 
softening system will not work and you wili get hard 
water. 

To get to the nozzle and venturi, remove the water 
softening system top cover. Be sure the water 
softening system is in service cycle (no water 
pressure at nozzle and venturi). Then, while holding 
the nozzle and venturi housing with one hand, 
remove the cap. Lift out the screen support and 
screen, then the nozzle and venturi. Wash and rinse 
the parts in warm water until clean. If needed, use 
a small brush to remove iron or dirt Also check and 
clean the gasket. 

NOTE; Some models have a small flow plug located 
in the nozzle and venturi, and/or a small cone 
shaped screen in the housing. Be sure to check and 
clean these parts, if your model is so equipped. 
Carefully replace all parts in the correct order. Lightly 
lubricate the c— ring seal with clean silicone grease 
or petroleum jelly and place in position, install and 
tighten the cap, by hand only. Do not overtighten 
the cap. 

BREAKING A SALT BRIDGE 
Sometimes, a hard crust or salt bridge forms in 
the salt storage area. It is usually caused by high 
humidity or the wrong kind of salt. When the salt 
bridges, an empty space forms between the water 
and salt. Then salt will not dissolve in the water to 
make brine. 

If the brine tank is full of salt, it is hard to tell if you 
have a salt bridge. Salt is loose on top, but the bridge 
is under it. The following is the best way to check for 
a salt bridge. 

Salt should be loose all the way to the bottom of the 
tank. Take a broom handle or like tool, and carefully 
push it down into the salt, working it up and down. 

If the tool strikes a hard object (be sure it's not the 
bottom or sides of the tank), it's most likely a salt 
bridge. Carefully break the bridge with the tool. Do 
not pound on the walls of the tank. To help dissolve 
the salt bridge pour one gallon of warm water (not 
hot) into the tank. 

If the wrong kind of salt made the bridge, take it out. 
Then fill the tank with nugget or pellet salt only. In 
humid areas, it is best to fill with less salt, more often 
to prevent a salt bridge from forming.

Troubleshooting Tips 

Save time and money I Review the chart on this page first and you may not 
need to caii for service. 


NO SOFT WATER - Most Common Problems: 

Check the following before coiling for service: 

• Not enough salt— should be at least 1/3 full. 

• Bypass valve in "Bypass" position— handle should be in the "OUT" (service) position. 

• Hardness setting too low. Check hardness setting and adjust Verify hardness of supply water- 
from local water company, water test or call the GE Answer Center (800-952-5039 in US). 

• Sait Bridge— salt solidifies above water level so that brine water is not in contact with salt. See 
the Breaking a Salt Bridge section. 


Problem 

Possible Cause 

What to do 

Mo soft wafer 

Faucet or fixture where sample was 
taken not plumbed to soft water. 

NOTE: 8e sure sample is from a faucet 
that does not mix soft and hard water. 
Tor example, a single lever kitchen 
faucet, if the cold side is plumbed to 
hard water. 

• To conserve salt, the installer may have isolated 
some fixtures (outside faucets, toilets, etc.) from 
soft water. From the outlet of the water soften- 
ing system, trace the water flow path, in house 
plumbing. If soft water is not directed to a faucet 
or fixture where wanted, consult a plumber. 


No salt in the brine tank or soit 
bridged 

• Check far a salt bridge or; if the tank is empty, refill 
with recommended salt. Press (for 3 seconds) 
the RECHARGE button to start an immediate 
recharge and restore soft water supply. 


External power supply unplugged 
at wall outlet or power cable to 
softener not connected. Fuse blown 
or circuit breaker popped on circuit 
to electrical outlet. Electrical outlet 
on a circuit that can continuously be 
switched off 

• Check for a loss of electrical power to the water 
softening system, due to any of these conditions 
and correct as needed. With the power supply 
restored, observe the faceplate time display and 
read Programming the Control section. NOTE: 
the electrical outlet for the softener should be live 
so it cannot be accidentally switched off. 


Manual bypass valve in bypass 
position 

• Be sure the bypass valve stem is positioned prop- 
erly, with the haridie in the OUT position. 


Biending valve in open position 

» Turn blending valve clockwise to closed position. 


Valve drain hose pinched, plugged, 
elevated too high or otherwise 
restricted 

• Any restriction in the drain hose may prevent 
proper operation of the nozzle and venturi and 
reduce or prevent brine draw' during recharge.. 


Nozzle and venturi dirty, incorrectly 
assembled or damaged 

• Refer to Cleaning the Nozzle and Venturi Assembly 
Instructions. With water pressure to the water 
softening system off, take the nozzle assembly 
apart. Inspect, clean and replace as needed. 

Any foreign particle(s), scratches, nicks, etc. in the 
passages can prevent operation. Be sure holes in 
the gasket are centred over holes in the housing.

AUTOMATIC ELECTRONIC DIAGNOSTICS 

This water softener has a 
self-diagnostic function 
for the electrical system 
(except into power and/ 
or water meter). The water 
softener monitors electronic 
components and circuits 
for correct operation. If 
a malfunction occurs, an error code appears in the 
display. 

While an error cade appears in the display, all buttons 
are inoperable except the MODE/SET button. 

MODE/SET remains operational sa the service person 
can perform the Manual Advanced Diagnostics, see 
below, to further isolate the problem. 

Procedure for removing error code from display: 

1, Unplug transformer from electrical outlet, 

2, Correct problem, 

3, Plug in transformer. 

4, Wait 8 minutes. The error code will return if the 
problem was not corrected. 

MANUAL INITIATED ELECTRONIC DIAGNOSTICS 
Use the following procedures to advance the water 
softener through the regeneration cycles to check 
operation. 

Lift off the Salt Hole Cover, remove the top cover by 
unlocking the tabs in the back and rocking forward, 
to observe cam and switch operation during valve 
rotation. 

1. Press and hold MODE/SET for 3 seconds until the 
Set low salt alarm display appears, next press the 
MODE/SET button five addition times until "000” 
shows in the display, then release, see Figure 19.

The 3 digits indicated water meter operation as 
follows: if you don’t get a reading ori the display, 
with faucet open, pul! the sensor from the valve 
outlet part Pass a small magnet back arid forth 


in front of the 
sensor. You 
should get a 
reading in the 
display. If you 
get a reading, 
shut off water 
supply, unhook 
the in and 
out plumbing 
and check the 
turbine for 



binding. 


3. Symbols in the display indicate POSITION switch 
operation, see Figure 19 

Switch is open Switch is closed 



■Water Meter/ Figure 19 


4. Use RECHARGE button to manually advance the 
valve into each cycle and check correct switch 
operation. NOTE: Be sure water is in contact with 
salt, and not separated by a salt bridge (see Breaking 
a Salt Bridge section). 

5. While in this diagnostic screen, the following 
information is available and may be beneficial for 
various reasons. This information is retained by 
the computer from the first time electrical power is 
applied to the electronic controller, 

a. Press the A. UP button to display the number 
of days this electronic control has had electrical 
power applied, 

b, Press the 'W DOWN button to display the 
number of regenerations initiated by the 
electronic control since the code number was 
entered. 

6. Press and hold the MODE/SF.T button until the mode 
code (H40 for GXSH40V or H45 for GXSH45VI shows 
in the display. This code identifies the softener 
mode. If an incorrect model code is displayed, the 
softener will operate on incorrect configurations 
data. 



7. To change the code number, press the A UP or 'w 
DOWN button until the correct code shows. 

8. To return to the present time display, press the 
MODE/SET button. 

9. Press the MODE/SET button to return to the present 
time display. If the code was changed, make all 
the timer setting. NOTE: If the control is left in a 
diagnostic display or a flashing display when setting 
times or hardness, present time automatically returns 
if a button is not pressed within four minutes.

Advanced troubleshooting for service . 


Service: Manually Advance Recharge Check 

NOTE: The control display must show a steady 
time {not flashing). 

1. Press the RECHARGE button and hold in for 
three seconds. RECHARGE begins to flash as 
the water softening system enters the fill cycle 
of recharge. Remove the brinewell cover and, 
using a flashlight, observe fill water entering the 
brine tank. If water does not enter the tank, look 
for an obstructed nozzle, venturi, fill flow plug 

or brine tubing. See Care and Cleaning of the 
Water Softener System section. 

2. After observing fill, press the RECHARGE 
button to move the water softening system 
into brining. A slow flow of water to the drain 
will begin. Verify brine draw from the brine 
tank by shining a flashlight into the brinewell 
and observing a noticeable drop in the liquid 
level over an extended period of time (is to 20 
minutes). 

NOTE: Be sure a salt bridge is not preventing 
water from contacting salt. See Care and cleaning 
of the water softening system section. 

if the water softening system does not draw brine, 
check: 

ss nozzle and/or venturi dirty or defective, 
is defective nozzle and venturi seal. 

Ss nozzle and venturi not seated properly 
on gasket. 

SS; other Inner valve defect (rotor seal, rotor and 
disc, wave washer, etc,), 
iii restricted drain (check, drain fitting and hose). 

NOTE: If water system pressure is low, an elevated 
drain hose may cause back pressure, stopping 
brine draw, 

3. Again, press the RECHARGE button to move the 
water softening system into backwash. Look 
for a fast flow of water from the drain hose. A 
slow flow indicates a plugged top distributor, 
backwash flow plug or drain hose. 

4. Press the RECHARGE button to move the water 


softening system into fast rinse, Again look for 
a fast drain flow, Allow the water softening 
system to rinse for a few minutes to flush out 
any brine that may remain in the resin tank 
from the brining cycle test. 

5. To return the water softening system to service, 
press the RECHARGE button.

arrastre o coloque en protuberancias ext r emas. 

Los sistemas de descalcificacion de agua que utiiicen 
cloruro de sodio (sal) para la recarga agregan sodio al 
agua. Las personas que siguen dietas con restricciones 
de sodio deben considerar el sodio adiciona! como 
parte de su consume general. El cloruro de potaslo 
puede servir como una alternativa para el cloruro de 
sodio de su descalcificador. 

Use solo soldadoras y fundiciones fibres de plomoy 
para todas las conexiones con estano, de acuerdo 
con lo requerido por Ios codigos estatales y 
federales. 

Este sistema suavizante de agua se debera irsstaiar

duros (agua descalcificada o agua blanda) fluye 
hacia la casa desde el sistema de descaicificadon. 

CIRCUNVALACIGN AUTOMATICA DEL AGUA 
DURA DURANTE LA RECARGA 

Durante la recarga, el suavizante de agua se 
coloca automaticamente en el modo de tubo de 
desviacion, permitiendo que e! agua dura este 
disponible en el hogar. Una vez que el suavizante 
es recargado, el agua es dirigida nuevamente a 


ENJUAGUE DE SALMUERA 
Despues de que se use una cantidad de salmuera 
medida con anterioridad, la vdlvula de salmuera 
se cierra. El agua continue fluyendo en la misma 
trayectoria que durante el proceso de salado, 
excepto por el flujo de salmuera discontinuado. 

Los minerales duros y la salmuera fluyen 
del tanque de resina hacia el desague. 

LAVADO REGRESIVO 

Durante el lavado regresivo, el agua viaja hacia 
arriba a traves del tanque de resina a un flujo de 
ritmo rapido, purgando el hierro acumulado, la 
suciedad, y los sedimentos desde la capa de 
resina hacia el desague, 

ENJUAGUE RAPIDO 

El lavado regresivo es seguido por un flujo de agua 
rapido hacia abajo a traves del tanque de resina. El 
flujo rapido purga la salmuera del fondo del tanque, y 
rellena el tanque de resina. 

A continuation del enjuague rapido, el sistema de 
descaicificadon de agua regresa al servicio de agua 
descalcificada. 


LLENADO 

La sal disuelta en agua es llamada salmuera. La 
salmuera es necesaria para limpiar los minerales 
duros de las diminutas particuias de resina. Para 
former la salmuera, el agua fluye hacia ei interior 
del tanque de sal durante el periodo de llenado. 

SALADO 

Durante el proceso de salado, la salmuera se 
desplaza del area del tanque de almaeenamlento 
de la sal hacia el tanque de la resina. La salmuera 
es el agente de limpieza necesario para remover ios 
minerales duros de la capa de resina. Los minerales 
duros y la salmuera son descargados hacia el

iNFGRMACSGN SOBRE LA CGNDiClQN DEL 
AGUA 

HIERRO 

El Hierro del aguci puede causar manchas en la 
ropa y accesorlos de plomeria. Piiede aiterar de 
forma negativa el sabor de la comida, el agua 
potable y otras bebidas. El Hierro del agua es 
medido en partes por millon (ppm). El ppm de 
Hierro total*, y el tipo o tipos* es determinado a 
traves de analisis quimicos. Los cuatro tipos de 
Hierro dlferentes en el agua son: 

■Hierro ferrosa (agua potable) 

■Hierro ferrico (agua roja) 

■Hierro asociado por bacterias y organismos 

■Hierro asociado err forma coloide e inorgdnica 
(ferroso o ferrico) 

El hierro ferroso (agua potable) es soluble y 
se disuelve en agua. Este suavizante de agua 
reducira cantidades moderadas de este tipo de 
hierro (lea las especificaciones). **El hierro ferroso 
(agua potable) normalmente se detecta tomando 
un ejernplo del agua en una botella ovaso limpios. 
inmediatamente luego de tornados, el ejemplo 
es claro. A medida que el ejemplo de agua se 
asienta, gradualmente se enturbia y se vuelve 
levemente amarilla o marron a medida que el aire 
oxida el hierro. Este normalmente ocurre entre los 
15 y 30 minutes. 

Al usar el suavizante para reducir el hierro 
ferroso (agua potable), agregue 5 granos a 
la configuration dura por cada 1 ppm de 
hierro ferroso (agua potable). Lea ia section 
“Configuration de! Numero de Agua Dura). 

Los hierros ferricos (agua roja), y asociados con 
bacterias y organismos son insolubles. Este 
suavizante de agua no eliminara el hierro ferrico 
ni las bacterias. Este hierro es visible de forma 
inrnediata al salir por un grifo, ya que se oxido 
antes de llegar al hogar. Aparece en forma de 
pequenas particulas turbias suspendidas decolor 
amarillo. anaranjado o rojizo. Una vez que el agua 
se asento por un periodo de tiempo, las particulas 
quedan en ei fondo del envase. Generalmente, 
estos hierros son eliminados del agua a traves del 
proceso de filtracion. Tambien se recomienda la 


cloracion con el hierro con bacterias. 

El hierro asociado en forma coloide o inorgdnico 
es de forma ferrica o ferrosa que no se filtrard ni 
intercambiard fuera del agua. Este suavizante de 
agua no eliminara el hierro coloidal. En algunas 
instaneias, el tratamiento puede mejorar ei agua 
con hierro coloidal. Normalmente, el agua con 
hierro coloidal cuenta con un aspecto arnarillento 
al ser extraldo. Luego de asentarse durante varias 
horas, el color persiste y el hierro no se asienta, 
sino que permanece suspendido en el agua. 

Colloidal and inorganically bound iron is of ferric 
or ferrous form that will not filter or exchange 
out of water. This water softener will not remove 
colloidal iron. In some instances, treatment 
may improve colloidal iron water. Colloidal iron 
water usually has a yellow appearance when 
drawn. After standing for several hours, the color 
persists and the iron does not settle, but remains 
suspended in the water. 

SEDIMENTS) 

El sedimento son particulas de material fino y 
extrano suspendidas en el agua. Este suavizante 
de agua no eliminara el sedimento. Con gran 
frecuencia este material es arcilla o cieno. Las 
cantidades extremes de sedimento pueden dar al 
agua un aspecto turbio. Un filtro de sedimentos 
instalado arriba del suavizante de agua 
normalmente corrige esta situation. 

* El agua puede contener uno o mas de los cuatro 
tipos de hierro y cualquier combination de estos. 
El hierro total es la suma de los contenidos. 

** La capacidad de reducir el hierro del agua 
potable es corroborada por datos evaluados de 
WQA. 

CLORO 

Las resinas suavizantes se pueden degradar 
en presencia de cloro sobre 2 ppm. Si el cloro 
excede esta cantidad, es posible que la resina 
experimente un periodo de duration mas corta. En 
estas condiciones, es recomendable considerar la 
compra de un sistema de filtracion para hogar GE 
Point-Of-Entry con un filtro para la reduction de 
cloro. 


46 





ANTES DE COMENZAR 

w El suavizante de agua requiere un flujo mfnimo de agua de 3 galones por minuto en la entrada. La 
presion de entrada de agua maxima tolerable es de 125 psi. Si la presion del dia supera los 80 psi, es 
posible que la presion nocturna supere el mdxirno. Si es necesario, utilice una valvula de reduccion de 
presion (agregar una valvula de reduccion de presion puede reducir el flujo). Si su hogar esta equipado 
con un preventor de flujo regresivo, se debera instalar un tanque de expansion de acuerdo con los 
codigos y leyes locales. 

m El suavizante de agua utiliza un suministro de corriente externa conectado en forma directa (incluido). 
Asegurese de usar el suministro de corriente incluido y enchufe el mismo en un tomacorriente de 
hogar con ciclo nominal de 120V, 60 que se encuentre en una ubicacion seca, conectado a tierra 
y correctamente protegido por un dispositivo de sobrecarga de corriente tal como un disyuntor o 
fusible. 

ih Este sistema no se debe usar con agua que no sea segura a nivel microbialogico o que sea de calidad 
desconocida sin una desinfeccion adecuada, antes o despues, del sistema.

AJUSTE DE LA DUREZA DEL AGUA 

La perilla de ajuste de mezcla (Figura 16) !e da la posibilldad 
de ajustarfinarnente la dureza del aguatratada, dejando 
el suavizante de agua. Si se desea un agua un poco mas 
dura que aquella normalmente provista par el suavizante 
de agua, la perilla de ajuste de mezcla puede desviar un 
pequeno flujo de agua dura y mezclar esta con el agua 
suave que entra al hogar. La carrtidad de agua desviada es 
controlada girando una perilla de ajuste de mezcla en la 
tapa de la cana de la valvula. 

NOTA: Para obtener el rendimiento cornpleto del suavizante 
de agua, deje la valvula de mezcla en la position cerrada 
configurada de fdbrica. 

Para bacer ajustes sabre la dureza del agua: 

1. Sostenga la manija de desviacion para evltar que la 
cana de la valvula rote (lea la figura 16;. Afloje la tuerca 
hexagonal en la perilla de ajuste de mezcla girando la 
tuerca hexagonal en contra de las agujas de! reloj. 

2. PARA INCREMENTAR LA DUREZA: Con la desviacion 
en la position del servicio (lea ia figura 16), sostenga 
la rnanjja para evltar que la cana de la valvula 
rote, y gire la perilla de ajuste de mezcla en contra 
de las agujas del reloj hasta 2 vueltas desde la 
position cerrada. Se recomienda hacer ajustes por 
incrementos de un cuarto durante varies semanas, 
hasta que se iogre el nivel de dureza deseado. NOTA: 
Una vez que se realize un ajuste sobre la perilla de 

la valvula de rnezcla, es posible que lleve varies dias 
abservar el cambio en la dureza del agua en los 
grlfos o las flares del hogar. Esta demora se debe a 
ias grandes cantidades de agua ya acondicionada 
en las tuberias y el calentador de agua, que se debe 
cambiar antes de que se observe una modification 
en la dureza. Soliate que se evalue el agua para 
determiner su nivel de dureza. 

3. PARA REDSJCIR LA DUREZA: Con la desviacion en 
la position del servicio (vea la figura 16), sostenga 
la manija para evitar que la cana de la valvula rote, 
y gire la perilla de ajuste de mezcla a favor de ias 
agujas del reloj. Cuando la perilla ya no gire, el agua 
dura ya no se esta mezclando en el agua suave. 

4. Una vez que se Iogre la dureza deseada, ajuste una 
tuerca hexagonal (vea la figura 16) en direction de las 
agujas del reloj, hasta que entre en contacto con la cana 
de desviacion. 

NOTA: Para cumplir con las especificaciones de 
rendimiento de! suavizante de agua y los reclames 
sobre la reduction de bario y radio, la funcion de ajuste 
de la dureza se debera mantener en la position "OFF" 
(Cerrada"), La position cerrada se logra cuando la perilla 
de ajuste de mezcla se rota completamente en direction 
de ias agujas de! reloj hasta que se detiene.

CONTROL DEL NIVEL OE ALMACENAMIENTO 
DE SAL y RECARGA 

La salmuera (sal disuelta en agua) es necesaria 
en cada recarga. El agua para hacer salmuera 
es medida en el area de almacenamiento de sal 
por la valvula del slstema suavlzante de agua y 
el control. Sin embargo, se debera mantener el 
tanque suministrado con sal. 

AGRE6AD0 DE SAL 

Levante la tapa del agujero de sal y controle 
el nivel de almacenamiento de sal de forma 
frecuente. Si el suavlzante de agua usa toda la 
sal antes de recargar la misma, obtendrci agua 
dura. Hasta que haya establecido una rutina de 
recarga, controle la sal cada dos o tres sernanas. 
Siempre agregue sal cuando la cantidad sea 
inferior a Yu. Asegurese de que la tapa del pozo de 
salmuera este colocada. 

NQTA: Si usara cloruro de potaslo (KCI), no supere 
el nivel A de la etiqueta del pozo de salmuera, 

NQTA: En areas humedas, es mejor mantener 
el nivel de almacenamiento de sal bajo, y hacer 
recargas mas frecuentes para evitar "puentes" de 
sal. 

Sai Recorrtendada: Pepitas, bolitas osal solar 
gruesa con menos del 1% de impurezas. 

Sal No Recomendada: Sal en roca, alta en 
impurezas, en bloque, granulada de mesa, 
derretida en hielo, para hacer helado, etc. 



PRECAUCION: 

Sai para suavizante de agua con 
aditivos para eliminar hierra: 


Aigunas sales cuentan con un aditivo para 
ayudar al sistema suavlzante de agua a 
eliminar el hierra del suministro de agua. 
Aunque este aditivo puede ayudar a mantener 
iimpia la resina del slstema suavizante de 
agua, tambien puede iiberar gases corrosives 
que debilttan y acortan la vida util de aigunas 
partes del sistema suavizante de agua. 


LIMPIEZA DEL HIERRO DEL SISTEMA 
SUAVIZANTE DE AGUA 

Su sistema suavizante de agua elimina ios 
minerales duros (calcic y magnesia) del agua. 
Ademas, puede controlar parte (lea la seccion 
de Pautas de Especificacion) del hierro del "agua 
potable". Con el hierro del agua potable, el agua 
de un grifo es potable cuando se coloca por 
primera vez en un vaso, Luego de entre 15 y 30 
minutos, el agua comienza a enturbiarse o ’tomar 
un color oxido. Un sistema suavizante de agua 
no eliminard ningun hierro que enturbie el agua 
o !a oxide al salir del grifo (llamado hierro de 
agua roja). Para quitar el hierro de! agua roja de! 
agua, o el maximo de hierro del agua potable, es 
necesaria un filtro de hierro u otro equipamiento. 

GE recomienda ei uso de Super Iron Out® para 
limpiar el lecho de resina si el contenido de hierro 
es alto. Use Super iron Out® con cada bolsa 
de sal de 40 lb. como medida preventive contra 
la acumulacion de oxido. Limpie e! lecho por io 
menos cada seis mesas, o con mayor frecuencia si 
aparece hierro en el agua blanda entre limpiezas. 

IMPQRTANTE: Es importante mezeiar e! Hrnpiador 
del fondo de resina con agua (siguiendo las 
instrucciones del fabricante), verier la misma en 
el pozo de salmuera (vea la Figura 9) y recargar 
e! suavizante de forma inmediata. No vierta el 
limpiador del fondo de resina con la sal, ya que 
no sera tan efectivo en la limpieza de la resina, y 
podrd ocasionar dahos al suavizante si se deja en 
e! tanque de salmuera por un periodo extendido 
debido a Ios gases corrosives que se forman.

UMPIEZA DEL ENSAMBLE DE LA BOQUSLLA Y 


EL VENTURI 

Una Hmpieza de la boquiiiay el venturi es necesaria para 
que e! sistema s uavizante ftmeione de forma correcta. 
Esta pequena unidad hace que la suction mueva ia 
salmuera del area de almacenamiento de sal a! tanque de 
resina durante la recarga. Si se tapa con arena, tierra, etc., 
el sisterna suavizante de agua no funcionara y se generard 
agua dura. 

Para liegar a la boquilla y el venturi, retire la tapa superior 
del sistema suavizante de agua. Asegurese de que el 
sistema suavizante de agua este en e! cido del serviciolsin 
presion de agua en la boquilla y el venturi). Luego, rriientras 
sostiene la caja protectora de la boquilla y el venturi con 
una mono, retire la tapa. Levante el soporte y la pantalla. 
y luego la boquiiia y el venturi. Lave y enjuague las plezas 
con agua tibia hasta que esten limpias. De set necesario, 
use un pincel pequeno para retirar e! nierro o la suciedad. 
Tambien controle y limpie la junta. 

NOTA: Algunos modelos cuentan con un enchufe de 
flujo pequeno ubicado en la boquiiiay el venturi, y/o una 
pequena pantalla con forma conica en la caja protectora. 
Asegurese de controlar y limpiar estas partes, si su rnodelo 
cuenta con este equiparniento. 

Con cuidado. reemplace todas las plezas en el orden 
correcto. Levemente lubrique el sello del aniilo o con grasa 
de silicona limpia o vaselina y coloque el mismo en su 
position. instate y ajuste ia tapa, sola en forma manual. 
No ajuste la tapa en excesa 

ROTURA DE UN PUENTE DE SAL 

A veces se forma una costra dura o un puente de sal en el 
area de almacenamiento de sol. Mormalmente es causada 
por el alto nivel de humedad o un tipo de sal inadecuado. 
Cuando se forman puentes de sal, se genera un espacio 
vaclo entre el agua y la sal. Luego la sal no se disuelve en el 
agua para formar salmuera. 

Si el tanque de salmuera esta lleno de sal, es dificil decir 
si se forma un puente de sal. La sal esta floja en la parte 
superior, pero el puente esta debajo de esta. La siguiente 
es la mejor forma de controlar la formation de un puente 
de sal. 

La sal deberia estar suelta hasta el fondo del tanque. Tome 
un mango de escoba o una herramienta similar, y con 
cuidado empuje la misma en la sal, trabajando hacia arriba 
y abqjo. Si la herramienta golpea un objeto dure (asegurese 
de que no sea la parte inferior ni los costados del tanque), 
es rriuy probable que sea un puente de sal. Con cuidado 
rompa el puente con la herramienta. No goipee las paredes 
del tanque. Para ayudar a disolver el puente de sal, vierta 
un galon de agua tibia (no caiientel en el tanque. 

Si el puente se formo con el tipo de sal inadecuado, 
retfrelo. Luego llene e! tanque con sal en pepitas o boiitas 
unicamente. En areas humedas, es mejor lienar el tanque 
con rnenos sal, con mayor frecuencia para evitar la 
formation de un puente de sal.

Getting Maximum Efficiency From the Appliance 

To achieve the maximum benefit and performance from this appliance, familiarize yourself with this manual and 

the appliance. 

1 . Should your electricity be off for any reason, check your controller for the correct time and reset as 
necessary (See Setting the Controller). 

2. Program the appliance to regenerate at a time when the water is not being used. If there is more than one 
appliance, allow two hours between each regeneration. For optimum performance, program the water 
softener to regenerate first followed by any filter. 

3 . If dirt, sand, or large particles are present in the water supply, the appropriate WaterBoss® filter can 
eliminate this problem. 

4 . Protect the appliance, including the drain line, from freezing. 

5 . The bypass valve (located on the main control valve) enables you to bypass the appliance if any work is 
being performed on the appliance, well pump, or plumbing. See Bypass Valve. Use Bypass position also 
for watering plants or lawns with untreated water. 

8, Before putting the appliance back in service after work has been performed, turn on the nearest cold water 
tap until water runs clear. 

7. Adhere to all operational, maintenance, and placement requirements. 

8 . Potassium permanganate will need to be added periodically to any iron filter.

Checklist Before Installation 

Refer to this checklist before installation. 

□ Water Quality— If the water supply contains sand, sulfur, bacteria, iron bacteria, tannins, algae, oil, acid, or 
other unusual substances, consider pre-treating the water to remove these contaminants before the water 
supply enters the appliance, unless the appliance is represented as being capable of treating these 
contaminants in its specifications. 

The appropriate WaterBoss® Water Filter can address these water shortcomings. 

* Model 900IF (Iron Filter)-Reduces iron, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, and iron bacteria. 

® Model 900CF (Carbon Filter)-Reduces chlorine taste and odor. 

«■ Model 900NF (Acid Neutralizing filter)— Adjusts low pH water to a non-corrosive state. 

A WaterBoss® Water Softener Model 700 or 900 is highly recommended when using a WaterBoss® filter. 

□ Iron— A common problem found in many water supplies is iron. It is important to know what type of and how 
much iron is in the water supply. 




Ferrous Iron (sometimes 
called clear water or 
dissolved iron) 

Only type of iron that can be treated with a water softener 

Ferric Iron 

Insoluble and the particles can eventually foul a resin bed. It should be filtered out before 
the water reaches the softener 

Organic Iron or Bacterial 
Iron 

Attached to other organic compounds in the water. Additional treatment is needed to 
remove this type of iron 

Colloidal Iron 

Not dissolved, yet stays in suspension. A softener cannot remove this type of iron 


□ Water Characteristics— Model 900IF Iron Filter requires a pH of 7 or above to function properly. An iron test to 
determine iron levels is also necessary. The 900NF Acid Neutralizing Filter adjusts pH levels of 6.3 or above. 

□ Water Pressure— Not less than 30 psi or greater than 1 20 psi (2. 1-8.4 bar) constant for WaterBoss® filters. If 
water pressure exceeds 70 psi (4.8 bar), a pressure regulator is recommended. 

□ Water Supply Flow Rate— A minimum of 5 gallons per minute or equal to the backwash flow rate of the 
particular model is recommended. For the purposes of plumbing sizing, only the rated service flow rate and 
corresponding pressure loss may be used. Prolonged operation of a water filter at flow rates exceeding the 
tested service flow rate may compromise performance. 

□ Water Temperature— Not less than 40° or greater than 1 20°F (4°-49°C). For 900IF Iron Filter, do not exceed 
80°F (27°C). 

□ Drain— Drain the appliance to an appropriate drain, such as a floor drain or washer drain that will comply with 
all local and state plumbing codes. To prevent back-siphoning, provide an adequate air gap or a siphon break. 
See Installation Steps and Start-Up Procedures. 

□ Electricity— The transformer supplied is for a standard 120 volt, 60-cycle AC outlet for locations in North 
America or 220 volt, 50-cycle AC outlet for locations outside North America. 

If you have any questions, call the HelpLine. See General Information at the front of the manual for information 
about the HelpLine.

Step 46: (Optional) Hard Plumbing With Copper 
Fittings 

When preparing the male threaded fittings of the I/O 

adapter, use the following guidelines to avoid damage to the 

plastic pipe threads. 

A, Wrap the threads three times with 1/2-inch (2.5-cm) wide 
Teflon tape. Place each consecutive wrap on top of the 
previous wrap. 

B, To prevent tearing of the tape, use Teflon paste on the 
first two male threads only. The paste lubricates the tape 
and fills the small void areas that might exist between the 
threads. When the joint is complete, there will be a small 
bead of sealant at the fitting interface, which indicates a 
properly joined connection. 

CT Use a union with a threaded connection to facilitate repair of potential leaks in soldered 
joints. 

D, Prepare the copper tail assemblies in advance to enable them to cool prior to final assembly. 
Advance preparation and cooling will prevent heat damage to the plastic pipe threads of the 
adapter. 

E, Ensure that the copper tube is at least 4 inch (10 cm) long. 

F, Turn the fitting counterclockwise until you feel the threads engage and then tighten to 
prevent cross threading. Do NOT overtighten the fittings. 

Caution: Do NOT allow heat from the torch to transfer to the plastic valve component, 
which could be damaged.

Installation Steps, Cont. 

Plastic (PVC/CPVC) Pipe Joining Procedure 

To ensure reliable joint integrity when using solvent cement for PVC/CPVC plumbing, follow 

these recommendations: 

A, Cutting— The pipe must be cut square to allow for the proper interfacing of the pipe end and 
the fitting socket bottom. Use a wheel cutter, miter saw, or a ratchet shear for best results. 

B, Deburring and Beveling— Use a knife, plastic pipe deburring tool, or a file to remove burrs 
from the end of the pipe. Be sure to remove all burrs from the inside as well as the outside of 
the pipe. Remove all loose plastic debris since it could clog the injector. All pipe ends should 
be beveled to permit easier insertion of the pipe into the fitting. Failure to bevel the pipe end 
may cause a “wiping” effect in the fitting where the cement is forced to the end of the fitting 
socket. This creates a weak joint. 

C, Test Dry Fit of the Joint— Tapered fitting sockets are designed so that an interference fit 
should occur when the pipe is inserted about one-third to two-thirds of the way into the 
socket. Occasionally, when pipe and fitting dimensions are at the tolerance extremes, it will 
be possible to fully insert dry pipe to the bottom of the fitting socket. When this happens, a 
sufficient quantity of cement must be applied to the joint to fill the gap between the pipe and 
fitting. 

D, Inspection, Cleaning, and Priming— Inspect the inside of the pipe and fitting sockets and 
remove dirt, grease, or moisture with a clean dry cloth. If wiping fails to clean the surfaces, 
use a chemical cleaner. Check for possible damage such as splits or cracks and replace if 
necessary. Use purple primer to penetrate and soften the bonding surfaces of the PVC or 
CPVC pipe and fittings. Proceed without hesitation to the cementing procedure while the 
primed surfaces are still wet. 

E, Application of Solvent Cement— Apply the solvent cement evenly and quickly around the 
outside of the pipe while the primer is still wet. Apply a light coat of cement evenly around the 
inside of the fitting socket. Do not allow excess cement to “puddle” in the fitting. Apply a 
second coat of cement to the pipe end. 

F, Joint Assembly— Working quickly, insert the pipe into the fitting socket and give a 1/4-turn 
of the pipe or fitting while pushing toward the fitting stop. This action will evenly distribute the 
cement. Do NOT continue to rotate the pipe or fitting after the stop has been reached. Hold 
the joint tightly together for about 1 5 seconds to prevent the pipe from “creeping” out of the 
fitting. A good joint will have sufficient cement to make a small bead all the way around the 
outside of the fitting hub. The joint should not be disturbed immediately after the cementing 
procedure. Allow adequate time for the joint to cure properly. Exact drying time is hard to 
predict because of environmental variables. Follow the recommended joint curing times on 
the primer and cement container labels.

Connect Gravity Overflow Connection 


The overflow line drains away excess water should the 
tank fill with too much water or the appliance 
malfunction. 

A, Attach the overflow connection and check that it is 
in the down position. (See Figure 5.) 
i. Connect 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) I.D. tubing (size cannot 
be reduced) between the overflow connection and a 
suitable floor drain, laundry tub, or other suitable 
waste receptor. This tubing is not supplied with the 
appliance. Ensure that the overflow line ends at a 
drain that is at least 3 inches (76 mm) lower than 
the bottom of the overflow fitting. Maintain a 
minimum of 2-inch (50-mm) air gap. The gravity line 
cannot be run overhead. 



Connect Drain Line 

The drain line carries away the backwash water as 

part of the regeneration cycle. 

A, Connect the drain line to the drain end cap 

(See Figure 6) with a minimum 5/8-inch I.D. tubing 
(supplied). The size cannot be reduced. 

Note: Screw the drain fitting into the drain end cap. 

B, Route the drain line to a floor drain, laundry tub, or 
other suitable waste receptor. Maintain a minimum 
2-inch (50-mm) air gap between the drain line and 
the flood level rim of the waste receptor to prevent 
back-siphoning. This drain line should make the 
shortest run to the suitable drain. 

C, The drain line may be elevated up to 8 feet (2.4 m) 
from the discharge on the appliance as long as the 
water pressure in your system is 40 psi (2.8 bar) or 
more. 

0, If the drain line is 25 feet (7.6 m) or longer, increase 
the drain line to 3/4-inch (19-mm) I.D. The end of 
the drain line must be equal to or lower in height 
than the control valve. All overhead drains for filter 
installations must be 3/4-inch (19-mm) I.D. 

Caution: The drain line must not be kinked, 
crimped, or restricted in any way.

Before placing the filter in service, backwash the filter to remove fine media particles in the filter 
bed. To backwash the filter, start the regeneration cycle as follows: 

A., Press and hold the Regenerate button until the controller indicates 01 (flashing). The 
regeneration cycle begins. 

8 , Regeneration is complete after seven minutes, and the appliance returns to Service position. 
The controller will display a 01 or 02. This number is the days until the next regeneration. 

Adjust Water Softener Hardness Setting 

Typically, hardness will increase by two to four grains after passing through the neutralizing filter 
(0. 1 3-0.26 grams). If you have a water softener, after implementing the start-up steps for the 
acid neutralizing filter: 

A, Test the hardness of the water before it enters the water softener. 

B. Reset the hardness setting appropriately on the water softener. 


Note: The appliance requires periodic (annual) replenishment of the neutralizing media that 
adjusts the pH level of the water. See 900NF Acid Neutralizing Filter Replenishment Procedure.

Start-Up Procedures — 900IF Iron Filter, Cont. 




Start the Regeneration Cycle 

A. Press and hold the Regenerate button until the controller indicates 01 (flashing). The 
regeneration cycle begins. During regeneration, water bypasses the appliance to allow iron 
and sediment to wash down the drain through the following six-step process: 

1 . First Upflow Backwash— A rapid upflow of water flushes out the media bed. 

2. Regeneration— Regenerant is drawn out of the solution cabinet and up through the 
media tank, cleaning the media bed and releasing accumulated iron and hydrogen 
sulfide. 

3. Slow Rinse— A slow upflow rinse process that flushes out the regenerant and iron. 

4. Second Upflow Backwash— This upflow backwash flushes out any remaining 
regenerant and sediment from regeneration. 

5. Downflow Clean Water Refill— Filtered water is directed to the solution cabinet to 
prepare the regenerant for the next regeneration sequence. 

6. Return to Service— Regeneration is complete after approximately 45 minutes and the 
appliance is returned to Service position. The controller will display a number between 
01 to 14. This number is the days to next regeneration. 

Program the Regeneration Cycle 

A , To ensure reliable performance and optimum efficiency, program the regeneration cycle to 
occur every one to fourteen days. Use the following worksheet to determine the appropriate 
frequency for scheduling the regeneration cycle for your appliance. Use the example as a 
guide. 

8 , On the controller, set the frequency and time of day for regeneration to occur. Follow the 
instructions provided in Setting the Controller.

900NF Acid Neutralizing Filter Replenishment Procedure 


The neutralizing media that adjusts the pH level of the water must be refilled periodically (annually). Typically, 
this media is calcite and is available from WaterBoss®. To refill the neutralizing media, measure the appliance’s 
media bed depth upon installation (factory freeboard). Use this measurement to determine the amount of media 
to add to maintain optimum performance of the 900NF. 


Tools and Materials Needed 


The following tools and materials are needed to 
® Analog scale (do not use digital) 

® Steel tape measure 
® 5-gallon (18.9 liters) bucket with handle 
® Replacement media (P/N M050) 


replenish the neutralizing media: 

® 1/2-inch (1 .3 cm), 4-ft (1 .2 m) siphon hose 
® Funnel with 1-inch (2.5 cm) fill tube 
® 36-inch (1 meter) wooden ruler or dowel rod 
® 3/4-inch (19-mm) socket with ratchet

The replenishment procedure is as follows: 





Example: 


Turn Off the Water 

A, T urn off the water to the appliance. 

8 , Open a tap to depressurize the appliance. 

C„ Close the tap. 

Remove Water From Media Tank 

A, Use the 3/4-inch (19-mm) socket to 
remove the fill plug from the media tank. 

B, Insert the siphon hose into the fill port. 

C, Siphon the water into the bucket until the 
media level in the tank is reached. 

$ 

Calculate Amount of Media 
to Replenish 

A. Measure the freeboard distance from the 

top of the tank to the media. 

See Figure 10. 

Note: The recommended freeboard 
distance is 6.5 inches (16.5 cm). 

B, Add 4.5 lb (2 kg) of media per inch below 
6.5 inches (16.5 cm). 



Measured freeboard 8.5 inches (22 cm) 

Minus factory freeboard - 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) 


Figure 10: Maximum Freeboard Amount 


Equals Adjusted freeboard 2.0 inches (5 cm) 


Replenishment equals approximately 4.5 lb (2 kg) of media x 2.0 inches (5 cm) (adjusted freeboard) = 9 lb (4 kg).

Throat 

In conjunction with the Injector Nozzle (53224) it creates the vacuum that draws the brine solution 
from the brine cabinet. The center hole should be clear of debris, round, and undamaged. The 
Throat should be pressed flush into the opening in the valve. If the Throat is removed, it must be 
replaced with a new one. 

53224 Injector 
Nozzle with 
Over-Mold Gasket 

Together with the Throat (93223) creates the vacuum that draws the brine solution from the Brine 
Cabinet. The small hole in the Injector Nozzle (53224) is the one that creates the 
“injection-stream” that enters the Throat. It is important that this hole is round, undamaged, and 
clear of debris. If this hole becomes “clogged,” do not use anything (such as metal objects) to 
clear this opening. Damage may occur. Use a clean cloth and flush with water. If necessary, a 
wooden toothpick may be used. When assembling to the Valve, the Nozzle hole should line up 
with the Throat. Flush screen with water to clean, The over-mold gasket seals between the 
Injector Nozzle and the Injector Cap.

90217 Drive Motor 

The Motor is held in place by two, 1/2-inch self-tapping screws. The screws should be “snug.” The 
brass pinion gear on the Motor should engage the plastic Drive Gear (93238). The wires should 
be securely fastened to the Controller. 

93238 Drive Gear 

The Drive gear is assembled to the Slide Cam by means of a “keyed” opening, which transfers the 
“torque” generated by the Motor to the rest of the drive system. If the drive system becomes 
jammed, this opening can become “rounded” causing the gear to turn, but not the Piston Slide 
Cam. If this occurs, clear the jam and replace the Drive Gear (93238) and Piston Slide Cam 
(93217). 

93219 Piston Slide 
Cam Cover 

The cover secures the Piston Slide Cam (93217) in place and acts as a bushing for the Cam 
Shaft. 

93217 Piston Slide 
Cam 

This is the “heart” of the drive system. There is a threaded stainless steel shaft that runs through 
the main drive axle. The Drive Gear (93238) is attached at the short end and the Magnet Disk 
(54502) at the other end. The Slide Cam is assembled inside of the Piston Slide (54202). This 
Cam Shaft should turn freely before the Motor is assembled. 

93583 Drive End Cap 

Seals the two openings on the Main Valve Body. The larger diameter opening is sealed with an 
O-Ring used as an axial or “face” seal. The O-Ring sits in a groove in the End Cap. This groove 
must be free of defects such as pits or scratches and also free of debris. The smaller diameter 
seal is accomplished with an O-Ring used as a radial seal. The O-Ring should be placed on the 
male boss on the End Cap. When assembling the End Cap to the Valve Body, care should be 
taken to make sure the small O-Ring is aligned with the opening in the Valve Body and that the 
large O-Ring stays in the groove in the End Cap. If misaligned, the O-Rings can become pinched 
and leak. 

54202 Piston Slide 

The Slide should move freely inside the End Cap Housing. 

53322 Drive Piston 
Assembly 

The Drive Piston attaches to the Piston Slide (54202) by placing the “slot” of the Piston onto the 
matching flat of the Slide. To remove Piston, rotate Piston 90° counterclockwise. To replace 
Piston, rotate 90° clockwise until you hear an audible “click.” See reference drawings below.

53510 Housing 

Just inside the entrance hole for the Brine Piston (53511) is a concave seat area that must be free of 
defects such as nicks, indentations, or debris. This seat area ensures a leak-free seal for the static 
O-Ring on the Brine Piston. If any defects are detected by visual inspection, repair or replace as 
needed.

Note: The iron filter operates in the same manner as the WaterBoss® Softeners, but with manganese greensand in place of the super 
fine mesh media. The iron filter uses a potassium permanganate (KMnC>4) solution for regeneration instead of salt regenerant. In 
service, the filter media aids in oxidizing the iron, manganese, and/or hydrogen sulfide to solid particles, trapping the particles in the 
filter bed. 

WaterBoss® Model 900IF Iron Filter automatically reduces iron and hydrogen sulfide. Install before your water softener. 

WaterBoss® Model 900CF Carbon Filter with the activated carbon filtering bed, reduces chlorine taste and odor. Install before your 
water softener. 

Note: This filter can be installed after a water softener in special situations. Call the HelpLine for specific applications. 

WaterBoss® Model 900NF Acid Neutralizing Filter adjusts low pH water. This adjustment will increase the water hardness by two to 
four grains. Install before your water softener. 

Operational, maintenance, and replacement requirements are essential for the product to perform to specification.

Water - fixed charges 

Fixed charge calculationl.docx; EM Statement on Water 3.24.2015.pdf 


Harvey, 

You had requested additional information on the fixed charges used in Flint's water rates. Hopefully the 
attached helps. I have also included some additional information showing that that many of the recent increases 
in rates were done prior to the EM being appointed. And also, a reminder that the system was in a deficit 
position when the EM came on board, making additional increases necessary. 

While the system is now solvent, it is not as strong as it once was. And the real challenge for all of is to figure 
out how to get rates down to an affordable level. But is cannot be done by simply reducing rates! 

I am sure you are aware that the Council voted last night to "do everything in their power" to return to the 
Detroit system. I am attaching my statement in response. 

Call if you have questions. 

Jerry 


l 



RESIDENTIAL WATER/SEWER RATES - FIXED AND COMMODITY CHARGES 


General statistics indicate that the average person uses between 80 and 100 gallons of water per day, or between 2,400 and 3,000 gallons per 
day. The City's general estimate for the average residential bill is based on consumption of approximately 5,200 gallons per day (7 units * 745 
gallons. So the average we use is not out of line if the average number of users in a residence is around 2. 

At $149 average costs per month, Flint's charges are very high in comparison to other systems, and an issues which must be addressed. 
Unfortunately, the Flint system, which has the capacity to serve a population of more than 200,000, now serves a population of approximately 
100,000. The system, as currently configured today, needs between $65 million and $70 million in revenues annually to operate. One cannot 
simply reduce rates without affecting the ability of the system to operate. 

Like many systems, Flint charges both a fixed charge and a commodity charge to generate revenues. The concept of the fixed charge is that there 
is a certain amount of the utility system which must operate regardless of how much of the commodity is used. Operation and maintenance of 
the system, including building, treatment, and distribution infrastructure, as well as debt service, are examples. 

On the other hand, chemicals, utilities, and staffing to a certain extent vary with the amount of the commodity and can thus be linked to usage. 

In Flint, the total fixed charge for the water and sewer bill accounts for approximately 40% of the average residential users bill. The amounts 
determined to be "fixed charges" were established many years ago, and the water rate study done for the City in 2014 made no 
recommendations for change. 

The Flint system, which more than 10 years ago was very stable financially, had declined into a deficit financial position by June 30, 2012. 
Significant rate increases, many of which were enacted before the State assigned an Emergency Manager in late 2011, were necessary to 
stabilize the financial position of the system. Other decisions, including the decision to partner with Genesee County in the KWA, and the 
decision to utilize the Flint River for an interim period, were made with the goal of stabilizing rates and moderating future increases. Safety, 
quality, and affordability are the key priorities going forward. 

Following is the detail of the water and sewer rate components.

Change in the Financial Position of the Water and Sewer System 


The financial position of the water and sewer system in 2003 was strong. However, by 2011 the financial position had declined to the point 
where the system was in deficit. In spite of increases made prior to the appointment of an Emergency Manager, the utility system was still in a 
deficit position in 2012. While the financial position of the system is now positive, it is still less strong than in 2003:

For Immediate Release 

Emergency Manager Statement on Water: Spending Extra $12 Million 
on Detroit Water “Incomprehensible” When Flint Water Just as Safe 

Flint, Michigan- March 24, 2015- At the City Council meeting held on Monday, March 23, 
2015, Flint City Council made a motion to “do all things necessary” to return to using water 
purchased from Detroit and discontinue use of the Flint River as a water source. The 
following statement from Emergency Manager Gerald Ambrose addresses that point: 


“Flint water today is safe by all EPA and MDEQ standards and the City is working daily 
to improve its quality. Users also pay some of the highest rates in the state because of 
the decreased numbers of users and the age of the system. 

“It is incomprehensible to me that 7 members of the Flint City Council would want to send 
more than $12 million a year to the system serving southeast Michigan, even if Flint rate 
payers could afford it. Water from Detroit is no safer than water from Flint. 

“If $12 million annually were available for discretionary use, it would be far better spent 
reducing rates paid by Flint customers and/or modernizing the City's system.”

Flint Emergency Manager

1 . 

Flint Emergency Management 


Before 2011 

Flint has been devastated by decades of plant closings and mass layoffs in the auto industry. In 1970, GM 
employed 82,000 workers in the city. Now, there are less than 8,000. Over the same four decades, the 
population has gone from 193,000 to just over 100,000. 

In 2002, the city of Flint attempted to avoid emergency management, by cutting $12 million, including closing a 
north side police precinct and halting ambulance service. Flowever, the review team determined that a fiscal 
emergency existed in Flint; former Gov. John Engler later declared a financial emergency and the city was placed 
under state receivership. Governor Engler appointed Ed Kurtz, former president of a private business college, as 
emergency financial manager to oversee Flint's finances. A city audit five months into Kurtz's tenure revealed a 
$26.6 million deficit. 

Before Kurtz was appointed, the city had eliminated its ambulance and housing services. The cuts Kurtz initiated 
included: closing the city's recreation centers, cutting mayor and council pay, raising water bills 11%, and 
eliminating 54 jobs. 

In 2004, Governor Granholm removed the emergency manager, but continued oversight through January 2006.

Emergency Management after 2011 
Achieved Benchmarks: 

• Complete elimination of operating deficits through cost reductions and the implementation of financial 
best practices 

• General Fund accumulated deficit reduction from 19.1 million in 2012 to approximately $7 million 
currently 

• Flint City Lockup reopens for the first time since 2008. It can house up to 110 inmates for up to 72 hours 
and costs $2.1 million annually to operate. 


1 



• Workforce and employee compensation both have been reduced by 20% 

• $850 million in unfunded OPEB liabilities has been reduced to $240 million 

• A qualified city administrator has been hired. 

• Consolidation of the city-funded 68 th district court into the county funded 67 th district court creating 
$800k in annual savings. 

• Consolidation of 911 dispatch services into the county system. More than $1 million in annual savings. 

• The City has adopted its first Master Plan since the 1960s. 

• The City adopted a new Capital Improvement Plan. 

• The City implemented a new methodology for blight. 

• The City will request a $7 million emergency loan to fully eliminate its remaining General Fund 
Accumulated deficit. 

Remaining Challenges: 

• OPEB reductions are subject to a federal lawsuit. Loss of this legal action means an additional $5million 
annual OPEB expense. 

• Future expense reductions are necessary to balance multi-year projections. 

• The transition to KWA and maintenance of the aging water distribution infrastructure are important 
challenges which require significant funding and continued leadership. 

• The City must reappraise all of the real property in the City prior to the 2018 Assessment Roll. This will 
be a costly, but necessary undertaking. 

II. Flint Water 


In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc. 
(TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & Sewer 
Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The purpose of this 
study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) in 
order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the City of 
Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, options presented were: 1) Flint Water 
Plant will provide 100% water, 2) 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, 3) 100% provision of 
treated drinking water by DWSD, or 4) provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination 
of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 

The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA, deciding later to join KWA. 
On April 25, Flint officially ended nearly 50-years of using DWSD to supply water. 

The city currently uses the Flint River until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is built, which will bring 
untreated Lake Huron water to Genesee County. KWA should be operational by winter 2016. 

The Flint River water is harder than DWSD. A number of residents are experiencing discoloration and order with 
the water. In addition there have been a number of citations largely around heightened levels of Total 
Trihalomethanes (TTHM). 


2 



Given water quality concerns, suggestions have been made that the City of Flint should return to using water 
purchased through the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). For many reasons, financial and 
otherwise, the City of Flint can ill-afford to switch courses at this point. The estimated cost to go back to the 
water provided by the DWSD is approximately $1 million per month and the City expects to be using the 
Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) Lake Huron water within or before the 1 st quarter of 2016. 

The City of Flint is proceeding with a series of actions to ensure the continued safety of Flint drinking water is 
maintained and that issues of discoloration and odor continue to be addressed. Most notably, the installation of 
a Granulated Active Charcoal filter (GAC) at the Water Treatment Plant is expected to be authorized this week 
by Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. 

The introduction of the GAC to the treatment process at Flint's plant will absorb or reduce the chemical 
precursors which will block or eliminate the formation of TTHM during the filtration process. Engineering and 
design are underway and installation of the GAC is targeted for completion by mid-July. Cost of this 
improvement is projected at $1.5 million and will be paid for by the proceeds from the state approved 
restructuring of the City's Drinking Water Revolving Fund loans. 

In addition to the installation of the GAC, the City of Flint is undertaking a number of other improvements to the 
water system in the coming months, including a water leak detection monitoring, completion of the hydraulic 
model and subsequent targeted hydrant flushing program, and the replacement of two miles of water main pipe 
in a critical area of the city. All of these improvements scheduled to occur within the next six months.

team will give you a final number. 


Because we don't want to be a state vendor, we won't sell them to

Per our last conversation, I expressed that we were interested 
acquiring and distributing 1500 water filters to Flint residents to 
assist with the quality (perceived or real) of their drinking water 
until the KWA pipeline comes online. 


A few weeks ago, you asked me to send you the product ID 
number so you could check with your suppliers regarding price. I 
apologize for taking long to send you product ID; a number of 
conversations needed to occur in Flint before we could proceed. 


The product ID for a Brita Filter for kitchen faucets is:

Per our last conversation, I expressed that we were interested 
acquiring and distributing 1500 water filters to Flint residents to 
assist with the quality (perceived or real) of their drinking water 
until the KWA pipeline comes online. 


A few weeks ago, you asked me to send you the product ID 
number so you could check with your suppliers regarding price. I 
apologize for taking long to send you product ID; a number of 
conversations needed to occur in Flint before we could proceed. 


The product ID for a Brita Filter for kitchen faucets is:

All, 

On behalf of the Governor’s Office, please accept this email as a thank you to ^^^mtor 
the donation of 1500 kitchen water filters for Flint residents. I am aware you do not want any publicity 
or credit for the donation, but it is important for you to know the added comfort these filters will 
provide to the recipients as the water issue is resolved. 

The Flint Concerned Pastors organization held an event yesterday to give away the filters. Residents 
were invited to come to a central location to pick up their filter. The Concerned Pastors targeted low 
income Flint residents and more than 1500 households showed up. They exhausted the donated 
supply in 4 hours with 200 people still waiting to get a filter. 

Again, we appreciate^^^^^^^^^^ for being good corporate citizens. I wish all of you a Happy 
and Safe Labor Day Weekend. 

Best, 

Harvey

Subject: Flint Water Issue Update 

District Coordinator, Lt. Roach, attended meetings today at Genesee Co DHHS and Genesee Co Untied Way referencer 
the continuing problem with Flint's water. The first meeting consisted of DHHS, Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department (GCCARD), Dept, of Human Services, Genesee CO Health Dept., Commission on Aging, Genesee 
County EM Jen Boyer, and a few other county depts. The distribution of filters was the main topic of conversation. Lt. 
Roach learned that so far 20,000 Britta faucet filters were purchased from Home Depot with the million dollars the state 
provided. The filters are in Flint and will be housed at the GCCARD warehouse awaiting distribution. Genesee Co Public 
Health Dept is taking the lead on public messaging/press releases. 

Overall, it was a fairly productive meeting. Everyone from this meeting headed over to the next meeting at the United 
Way in Flint. Reps from the United Way ran the meeting which also included reps from the school district, public 
housing, and one rep, Sean Kammer, Asst to the City Administrator at the City of Flint. Unfortunately, Sean left early 
and requested he be emailed the information. Once again, a fairly productive meeting with distribution being the main 
topic of conversation, the use of volunteer groups to help install filters for elderly clients, school distribution, and public 
education/messaging. Much was worked out for distribution with it starting with priority groups. Attached is a 
summary of the meeting. 

Today, 1800 filters were being distributed to Flint Public Housing including Section 8 housing with the agreement their 
building maintenance will install the filters for those who cannot. Other priority groups should start in the morning. It 
was also requested the UPC codes be blacked out so returns could not be made to Home Depot. Zero Water is providing 
filtered cups for after school activities and athletes. All classrooms will get filtering units with a 24 cup capacity. There 
are talks of filters for all drinking fountains. For those who cannot attach a regular filter to their faucet, ZeroWater 
filtered pitchers are going to be supplied. United Way ordered some today and may be in this week. Under sink filters 
will not be purchased due to cost and potential installment issues. Brita filter pitchers do not meet lead standards so 
they will not be used. 

Jen Boyer has reached out to volunteer groups (CERT, VDF) for help with installments of filters for elderly or special 
needs people. There are also talks by the City of Flint water dept, of connecting outdoor faucets so people can go fill 
jugs for free. This may be decided by the end of the week. This water is good since it isn't going through any 


l 



distribution pipes. Lt. Roach advised there were talks of military water buffalos were brought up for water distribution 
for possibly the next week while the city works on getting their outdoor faucets figured out. I believe there may be 
other alternatives before we do this but I will get the NG as the water buffalos and any water distribution from them 
would need to be certified and that may take a couple days. 

Genesee Co Public Health Dept is taking the PIO lead with help from the PIO from the United Way, Tom 
Wickersham. Tom is a PIO for GM and volunteers for the United Way. 211 will be used as well as some websites to 
advise of distribution points and as well as education. Right now 4 points will be used :2 DHHS offices, and 2 GCCARD 
locations. The Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) is an organization of individuals 
whose overall goal is to eliminate barriers and level the playing field for the poor, seniors, children and the hard to serve 
population of Flint and Genesee County. These opportunities may include pre-school training through our Head Start 
department for the young; receiving additional and/or job training in order to find a permanent job; seeking and finding 
of adequate housing if displaced; receiving of nutritional meals delivered on a daily basis, or receiving home 
improvement repairs when necessary. 

A few areas of concern: lack of participation by the City of Flint government. The representative for Flint left early 
today with really not contributing anything to the effort while he was there. Ginna Holmes (DHHS) knows the Flint 
Mayor and is reaching out to him today ref this issue. The other area is people in the group expecting the state, namely 
Emergency Management, to run the meetings and the event. Lt. Roach explained we will not be running either but will 
participate and be a resource as much as possible. This is a local EM/public health issue unless it is determined we are 
taking the lead. Lt. Roach believes the Co Public Health Dept is going to take a lead role with help from others. Ginna 
Holmes and Jen Boyer will work closely with them along with DHHS. They have another meeting scheduled for Thursday 
at 10:00am at the United Way in Flint and Lt. Roach will be there and we will stay engage to assist. The United Way has 
done a tremendous job so far with this incident according to Lt. Roach. 

Below are some notes on the attached press release reference the filters: 

• Free water filters will be available to current Michigan Department of Health and Human Services clients and

Water filters available for MDHHS clients in Flint beginning Tuesday 

LANSING, Mich. - Free water filters will be available to current Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services clients and Flint residents at four locations beginning Tuesday, October 6, at 
9 a.m. through a partnership between the MDHHS and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. Free National Sanitation Foundation certified water filters are being 
provided to Flint residents as part of the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing 
water concerns in the area. 

Current MDHHS clients are encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office location to obtain a free, certified home water filter. Residents who are not 
currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should visit the Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices located at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. 
Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

“Ensuring that families in the Flint area have access to resources that will help reduce the potential 
for lead exposure is our top priority,” said Nick Lyon, director of the MDHHS. “I want to thank 
our partners who have mobilized to make water filters available - a point that highlights the 
importance of continued collaboration at the local, state and federal level as we move forward.” 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food 
Assistance Program (FAP), Child Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance 
(SDA), or Social Security Insurance (SSI) recipients should bring valid identification and a copy of 
their water bill to their local MDHHS office to receive their filter free of charge. Flint residents 
who are not active MDHHS clients should bring identification and their water bill to the GCCARD 
location. 

Although blood lead levels throughout the city of Flint have remained steady, last week, MDHHS 
data was found to be consistent with a recent Hurley Children’s Hospital study indicating 
increased blood lead levels in children residing in two Flint ZIP codes after a 2014 change in water 
source. While lead paint remains the number one cause of lead poisoning in Michigan, the recent 
data prompted MDHHS to take action to reduce potential lead exposures through water sources. 

MDHHS is urging parents in Flint and throughout the state to do their part in preventing elevated 
blood lead levels in children. For more information about steps you can take now, visit 
www .michi gan . gov/lead , or contact your local health department. For updates on Flint water and

http://www.mljve.com/naws/fjint/indeK.ssf/2013/03/fnnt city council approves re.html 
Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint 
for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the City. Another 2 million gallons per day would come 
from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or 
there would have to be additional work done at Flint's water plant. Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is 
currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times per year.

The Flint River was not a Gable option to provide drinking water to city residents when the water 
relationship between Flint and Detroit was stable. But river water might he used temporarily as the 
city's water supply now that Flint signed an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority and will 
get up to 18 million gallons per day of raw water in 2016 from Lake Huron. The Flint River hadn't 
been an option, city officials previously said, because upgrades to Flint’s water plant would be too 
expensive, the river didn't provide enough capacity to serve Flint residents' water needs and the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality would not allow it.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council March 25, may have set in motion the end to 

Flint paying to get its water from Detroit 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for 
treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the 
Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department Of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per 
day from the Flint River. 


Tuesday's meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 
“We got there," Councilman Joshua Freeman said, "That's the important thing.” 


There were more than 50 people at Monday's meeting. 

"Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion art: the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca 
Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition eyecdti ^liililllil "If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at 
risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs." 



Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste 
advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Hint has an emergency financial manager. 
All expenditures oyer £50,000 must be approved. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water

GENESEE COUNTY, MI — The state has approved a critical permit that allows the Karegiiondi 
Water Authority to tap into Lake Huron with a 1.5-mile underground intake. 


But water authority officials are still waiting for Flint to decide if it will he part of it. 


ConslTueiion on the Intake — estimated to cost $27 million — might mark the no-tuming-back 
point for the massive project, and county Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said other developments 
make it necessary Flint to make a final decision on its involvement in the next few months. 


As control of Flint has shifted from mayors and city councils to emergency managers, the city has 
never committed to buying a minimum volume of water from the KWA. 

"The only question at this point really is whether Flint is going to be a partner," said Wright, who has 
met with emergency financial manager Ed Kurtz and wants to resolve the question before Kurtz 
leaves his position — something likely to happen soon after the November election. 

"I'd say we have a couple of months here," Wright said of Flint's deadline. He described Kurtz as 
positive about the city's potential involvement but said, "There's still some questions Flint is working 
on with Detroit and Lansing.” 


Kurtz said he can't predict what will happen. 


"We're looking at all our options," Kurtz said Friday. 

County Commissioner Ted Henry, D-Clayton Twp., said regardless of the city's participation, the 
pipeline can be built by the remaining partners: Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties and the city of 
Lapeer, 

"The answer is yes," Henry said. "It will be a little different but it can go,"

The drain commissioner said construction of the pipeline intake, which has already been designed, is 
expected to start this year, after the job is put out for bids and borrowing is authorized by the county 
Board of Commissioners, 

Building the intake will be specialized work, part of which must be done from a barge, and will require 
building tunnels below the sand bo ttom of the lake and laying an 8 4 -inch pipe below the surface of 
the water. 

In addition to the state Department of Environmental Quality permit to build the intake, the KWA 
also needs approval from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Wright said. 


A. 45-day public comment period on the intake permit has passed and county officials said they expect 
the permit to be approved within two weeks. 

Among other recent developments in the pipeline project: 

® The Genesee County Water and Waste Advisory Committee, made up of elected and appointed 
city, township and village officials, has voted unanimously to set a date for accepting public 
bids to build the intake. 

* Tire same committee has approved negotiating a contract with Wade Trim to act as program 
manager for the pipeline project once all necessary permits have been received. 

® The county has revised its estimate on the cost of the intake portion of the pipeline from $40 
million to $27 million. 


Wright said his office is ready to negotiate a contract for Wade Trim to oversee the pipeline work, and 
said he expects six or seven engineering and surveying companies to assist in getting the job done. 


County officials count those jobs among the 1,000 that they say will he created by building the 
pipeline. 

"1 want to use local (people) wherever possible and keep the money here," Wright said. 

The drain commissioner said the selection of Wade Trim is important to the city of Flint because it 
signals the start of" engineering, which includes decisions about the size of pumps, motors and pipes 
that will be used to build the pipeline. 

Flint officials have options, including the use of Flint River water, or continuing to purchase wafer 
from the city of Detroit, 


5 



Wright said the only choice for the rest of the county is build the pipeline or sign a 30-year contract 
with Detroit. 


A KWA study claims that continuing to buy water from Detroit will cost the region $2.1 billion during 
the next 25 years. By building a pipeline, that cost would be $1.9 billion over the same period, the 
KWA Web site says. 


After the initial 25-year period, the cost of water would be less than 25 percent of the projected cost of 
water form Detroit, according to KWA.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Comprehensive action plan 
will help Flint residents address water concerns 

Collaborative effort with state, federal and city leaders focuses on testing, assistance 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint residents need to have access to safe, clean, water now and long into the 
future, Gov. Rick Snyder said, announcing a comprehensive action plan created with state, 
federal and city leaders to address concerns about drinking water. 

The water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to drink, but some families with lead 
plumbing in their homes or service connections could experience higher levels of lead in the 
water that comes out of their faucets. 

The action plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional precautions for families 
with lead plumbing in their homes, and providing long-term solutions to address the city’s water 
infrastructure challenges. The plan was created at Snyder’s direction by the Michigan 
Departments of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Health and Human Services (DHHS), the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the city of Flint. 

“We are focused on helping ensure safe, clean, accessible drinking water and addressing and 
mitigating concerns and protecting public health,” Snyder said. “Today’s action plan builds upon 
ongoing work with local, state and federal agencies and our partnership with city and community 
leaders. Together, we are working to ensure that all Flint residents have accurate information 
and know that help is available to address potential problems.” 

The city and the state also are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that 
leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all 
residents. The plan includes: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately to ensure that drinking water is safe, with 
testing also available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

• Offering free water testing to Flint residents to assure their drinking water is safe. 

• Providing free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state 
assistance programs. 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes. 




• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines. 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee to ensure the best 
technology, practices and science are being followed by adding an expert from the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development to the group. 

• Naming Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services, as the Flint drinking water public health adviser. 

• Boosting a comprehensive lead education program to make sure residents have detailed 
information about how to protect themselves and their homes. 

Residents can have their water tested by calling 81 0-787-6537 and pressing 1 , or emailing 
flintwater@cityofflint.com . The DEQ is covering the cost of this testing. 

State leaders have been working closely with state and federal lawmakers to tap resources at 
all levels of government to address concerns. 

State health experts said there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in 
some specific communities. Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels of 
children in Flint have followed an expected seasonal trend. While this analysis for Flint as a 
whole remains true, a comprehensive and detailed review breaking down data by ZIP codes 
with the city revealed that MDHHS data is consistent with a study presented recently by Hurley 
Children’s Hospital. 

“While we cannot conclusively say that the water source change is the sole cause of the 
increase, this analysis supports our efforts as we take active steps to reduce all potential lead 
exposures in Flint,” MDHHS Director Nick Lyon said. “As part of this, we are working closely 
with our public and private partners to provide Flint residents on MDHHS assistance programs 
with free water filters and inform families about the steps they can take to reduce all lead 
exposures in their home.” 

As a part of the action plan, MDHHS is making National Sanitation Foundation certified water 
filters available to clients who are active Family Independence Program, Food Assistance 
Program, Child Development and Care or Social Security Insurance recipients. 

“This action plan offers concrete steps we will take in a local, state and federal partnership to 
ensure all Flint residents have safe water to drink,” DEQ Director Dan Wyant said. “The DEQ 
will work closely with the city to gather further data to ensure the water that leaves Flint’s system 
as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe to drink.”

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan 
Talking Points 

Overall Messaging 

• Repeated testing shows the water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to 
drink and meets all federal guidelines, including lead. 

• After the switch the Flint River, the compliance testing protocol yielded results of 
6 ppb in December 2014 and 1 1 ppb in June 2015. Both results were below the 
federal action level of 1 5 ppb. 

• However, we recognize some residents experience higher levels of lead in the 
water that comes out of their faucets because of lead plumbing in the home, and 
that’s a concern. 

• Out of an abundance of caution, we want to address the needs of all Flint 
families, and so we have developed an action plan that includes both short- and 
long-term solutions. 

• The state plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional 
precautions for families, and providing long-term solutions to address the city’s 
water infrastructure. 

Messaging regarding the action plan 

The city and the state are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that 
leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all 
residents. 

• Immediately test Flint public schools to ensure that drinking water is safe. 
Testing will also be available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

o Although Flint’s drinking water meets all federal requirements, the state 
wants to take extra steps to ensure that drinking water is safe for the city’s 
children. 

o The state will fund this testing (about $30,000) at no cost to the city or the 
local schools, and make the results publicly available. 

• Expand health exposure testing of individual residences. 

o To double-check its data as well as provide residents with an additional 
layer of assurance, the DEQ will conduct more tests at Flint properties. 

o The Technical Advisory Committee will determine the scope of this 
expanded testing. 

• Offer water testing at no cost to Flint residents to assure water is safe. 

o Although all testing indicates water in the city of Flint meets all federal 
standards, we understand some residents are concerned. 

o To ensure water in individual homes is safe, free water testing is available 
to all Flint residents. 

o We encourage anyone with a concern to get their water tested. 

o Contact the city water department to have your water tested. 

• Accelerate optimizing corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 




o A fully optimized corrosion control system can help coat the inside of pipes 
to minimize the amount of lead that enters the drinking water after it 
leaves the treatment plant. 

o This is a helpful step that can help minimize lead system-wide, and we’re 
pleased the city is moving to take this step. 

o If asked: This was not initially required because a fully optimized corrosion 
control system is not federally required in many water systems. Even 
today, since Flint is meeting all federal standards, this fully optimized 
system is not required. However, to address public concerns and ensure 
every possible precaution is taken, the city is moving forward with 
installing this corrosion control system. 

Expand the “Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee” to 
ensure the best technology, practices and science are being utilized, and 
add an expert from the EPA’s Office of Research and Development to the 
group. 

o The Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 7 to 
discuss fully optimizing the corrosion control system, expanding testing of 
at-risk properties, and other topics. 

o Tom Burke, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of 
Research and Development as well as the EPA’s Science Advisor, will 
participate on the committee. Prior to joining EPA, he held prominent 
positions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and 
founded the Johns Hopkins Risk Sciences and Public Policy Institute. He 
brings substantial expertise, and we’re pleased he is able join the 
committee. 

Accelerate water system improvements to address replacement of lead 
service lines. 

o Regardless of the drinking water source - whether it be DWSD, the Flint 
River or Lake Huron - the only permanent fix for lead is to replace all 
18,000 of the private lead service lines in the city. These are the lines on 
private property that lead from the curb to individual homes. 

o This is a problem in communities statewide, and one we want to address 
with a long-term solution. 

o The state and EPA are working together to find a way for the city to 
access Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds for the work. 

Expedite completion of Karegnondi Water Authority. 

o The move to the Flint River was always a temporary measure until the 
connection to the KWA and to Lake Huron was completed. 

o This is the ultimate goal of the venture, and the state and locals will work 
together to speed up completion of the connection. 

o 

Name Dr. Eden Wells as Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor. 

o Dr. Wells is the Director for the Preventive Medicine Residency at the 
University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor as well as the 
Chief Medical Executive for MDHHS. 



o 


She brings years of experience in epidemiology and preventative medicine 
to the issue, and we’re thrilled to have her expertise. 

o Dr. Wells will coordinate with Hurley Medical Center to share data on 
blood lead levels in children, as well as address other emerging issues. 

Provide water filters to residents of Flint. 

o As an additional precaution, water filters will be available to low-income 
families. 

o This provides another safeguard to ensure everyone in the city of Flint has 
access to clean drinking water that they feel confident drinking. 

Expand a comprehensive lead education initiative. 

o Lead plumbing is common in homes built prior to 1986, and anyone in the 
state with lead pipes in their home can take some extra precautions to 
minimize lead in their drinking water. 

o It takes time for lead to accumulate in drinking water from plumbing, and 
so flushing your pipes prior to using them can minimize your exposure. 

■ To flush your pipes, run the water until it’s as cold as it will go. This 
can take as little as 5 to 30 seconds if you have recently flushed the 
toilet or otherwise used water in your home, or as long as 2 to 5 
minutes if you have not used any water in hours. 

■ In the city of Flint, running the water for 5 minutes only costs about 
3-16 cents, depending on your faucet. 

o Additionally, more lead gets into hot water than cold water. Use only cold 
water for drinking, cooking and making baby formula.

Flint Emergency Management Briefing 

Before 2011 

Flint has been devastated by decades of plant closings and mass layoffs in the auto industry. In 1970, 
GM employed 82,000 workers in the city. Now, there are less than 8,000. Over the same four decades, 
the population has gone from 193,000 to just over 100,000. 

In 2002, the city of Flint attempted to avoid emergency management, by cutting $12 million, including 
closing a northside police precinct and halting ambulance service. However, the review team 
determined that a fiscal emergency existed in Flint, former Gov. John Engler later declared a financial 
emergency and the city was placed under state receivership. Governor Engler appointed Ed Kurtz, 
former president of a private business college, as emergency financial manager to oversee Flint's 
finances. A city audit five months into Kurtz's tenure revealed a $26.6 million deficit. 

Before Kurtz was appointed, the city had eliminated it's ambulance and housing services. The cuts Kurtz 
initiated included: closing the city's recreation centers, cutting mayor and council pay, raising water bills 
11%, and eliminating 54 jobs. 

In 2004, Governor Granholm removed the emergency manager, but continued oversight through 
January 2006.

creating $800k in annual savings. 

• Consolidation of 911 dispatch services into the county system. More than $1 million in annual 
savings. 

• The City has adopted its first Master Plan since the 1960s. 

• The City adopted a new Capital Improvement Plan. 



• The City implemented a new methodology for blight. 

• The City will request a $7 million emergency loan to fully eliminate its remaining General Fund 
Accumulated deficit. 

Remaining Challenges: 

• OPEB reductions are subject to a federal lawsuit. Loss of this legal action means an additional 
$5million annual OPEB expense. 

• Future expense reductions are necessary to balance multi-year projections. 

• The transition to KWA and maintenance of the aging water distribution infrastructure are 
important challenges which require significant funding and continued leadership. 

• The City must reappraise all of the real property in the City prior to the 2018 Assessment Roll. 
This will be a costly, but necessary undertaking. 


Flint Water Briefing 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, 
Inc. (TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & 
Sewer Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The 
purpose of this study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency 
Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the 
City of Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, options presented were: 

1) Flint Water Plant will provide 100% water, 2) 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, 
3) 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or 4) provision of variable amounts of water from 
DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 

The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA, deciding later to join 
KWA. 

On April 25, Flint officially ended nearly 50-years of using DWSD to supply water. 

The city currently uses the Flint River until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is built, which will 
bring untreated Lake Huron water to Genesee County. KWA should be operational by winter 2016. 

The Flint river water is harder than DWSD. A number of residents are experiencing discoloration and 
order with the water. In addition there have been a number of citations largely around heighten levels 
of Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM). 


Given water quality concerns, suggestions have been made that the City of Flint should return to using 
water purchased through the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). For many reasons, 
financial and otherwise, the City of Flint can ill-afford to switch courses at this point. The estimated cost 
to go back to the water provided by the DWSD is approximately $1 million per month and the City 
expects to be using the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) Lake Huron water within or before the 1 st 
quarter of 2016. 



The City of Flint is proceeding with a series of actions to ensure the continued safety of Flint drinking 
water is maintained and that issues of discoloration and odor continue to be addressed. Most notably, 
the installation of a Granulated Active Charcoal filter (GAC) at the Water Treatment Plant is expected to 
be authorized this week by Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose. 

The introduction of the GAC to the treatment process at Flint's plant will absorb or reduce the chemical 
precursors which will block or eliminate the formation of TTHM during the filtration process. 

Engineering and design are underway and installation of the GAC is targeted for completion by mid-July. 
Cost of this improvement is projected at $1.5 million and will be paid for by the proceeds from the state 
approved restructuring of the City's Drinking Water Revolving Fund loans. 

In addition to the installation of the GAC, the City of Flint is undertaking a number of other 
improvements to the water system in the coming months, including a water leak detection monitoring, 
completion of the hydraulic model and subsequent targeted hydrant flushing program, and the 
replacement of two miles of water main pipe in a critical area of the city. All of these improvements 
scheduled to occur within the next six months.

Mr. Baird and a!! the other guys. 


It was a pleasure meeting everyone and a privilege to present to you all. As I said, we have art incredible and unique opportunity to 
mitigate the impact of this population-wide exposure. If we act now, proactively, we can buffer our kids from the life-altering 
impacts of lead poisoning. 


Flint has many claims to fame (we put the world on wheels, we birthed Mr, Baird!, etc); and now, with your leadership, we can 
continue to build generations of strong, smart, and healthy children. 

if I can be of any further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me. Email or cel I 

Thanks again, Mona

• Lead is a potent neurotoxin with lifelong, 
multigenerational impacts 

• Blood lead levels (BLL) 5 ug/dL or more 
considered elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) 

» Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

• NO safe blood lead level 

• Disproportionately impacts low income and 
minority children 


Primary prevention is most important 


Primary Prevention 



“Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear to 
be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental and 
housing policies should encourage PREVENTION 
of all exposure to lead.” 



“Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary 
Prevention.” 2012 CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention. 


Impact on cognition 



Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

« Decrease in IQ 

An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low 
IQs (<70) 

Implications for early intervention, special education services, 
employment, incarceration, life achievement, etc

“For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 billion in medical care 
costs, as well as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity

Quick Introduction to 





Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) 

• ACEs are potentially traumatic events that can have 
negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. 

• Also referred to as toxic stress or childhood trauma. 

• As number of ACEs increase, the risk for health 
problems increase in a strong and graded fashion. 

• An ACE score of 6 or more results in a 20 year 
decrease in life expectancy. 

• CDC ACE study 

• Kaiser Permanente from 1995 to 1997 with more than 
17,000 participants.

activation of the body's stress-response 
system in the absence of the buffering 
protection of a supportive, adult 
relationship."

Nod Steps 


• Primary prevention failed 

• Preventable population-wide exposure 

•Secondary prevention must be priority 

•Invest and prioritize in evidence based 
interventions that mitigate exposure and build 
childhood resilience 

•Ages 0 to 6 years critical for life course trajectory 


Top Five Interventions 



1. Support for emergency response 

2. Increase funding/capacity for home visiting 
maternal-infant support programs 

3. Guarantee Flint Pre-Promise (3-5 year quality

Perfect storm for lead leaching 

® Flint water more corrosive 

• Lack of corrosion control 

• Aging infrastructure (lead plumbing) 

• Decreased water use - population loss, high water 
rates

• Lead is a potent neurotoxin with lifelong, 
multigenerational impacts 

• Blood lead levels (BLL) 5 ug/dL or more 
considered elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) 

» Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

• NO safe blood lead level 

• Disproportionately impacts low income and 
minority children 


Primary prevention is most important 


Primary Prevention 



“Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear to 
be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental and 
housing policies should encourage PREVENTION 
of all exposure to lead.” 



“Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary 
Prevention.” 2012 CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention. 


Impact on cognition 



Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

« Decrease in IQ 

An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low 
IQs (<70) 

Implications for early intervention, special education services, 
employment, incarceration, life achievement, etc

“For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 billion in medical care 
costs, as well as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity 
analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) per year in lost economic 
productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure.” 


“The present value of Michigan’s economic losses 
attributable to lead exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year- 
olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. blood lead levels) to 
$4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per year in 


loss of future lifetime earnings.”

Research results 


* % of children with EBLL in Flint zips increased 

* Most striking increase in areas with highest water lead 
levels 

Results significantly underestimate exposure 

Infants not screened for lead 

* BLL may have peaked before being measured (blood 
half life 20-30 days) 

» Kids exposed in different settings throughout city 
•Widened disparities 
Failure of primary prevention 



What happened next? 


• Sept 25 City of Flint Lead Health Advisory 

• Sept 29 GCHD Health Advisory 
•Oct 1 GCHD Public Health Emergency 
•Oct 2 State filter program, increased water 

testing, expedited corrosion control 

•Oct 3 First filter distribution 

•Oct 8 Three schools toxic WLL, announced 
reconnection to DWSD 



• Oct 16 Water switched back to DWSD 



"A team of researchers at Wayne 
State University have discovered that 
mothers with high levels of lead in 
their blood not only affect the fetal 
cells of their unborn children, but 
also their grandchildren. " 


• Preventable population-wide exposure 

• Community traumatized 

• Loss of trust in government and agencies 

• In 2015, in the middle of the great lakes, no 
guarantee of safe drinking water 

• Ongoing public health emergency

txpos0ci population 

• Currently identifying/labeling exposed 
population 

• Cohort includes all children less than 6 years 
who at any time lived in Flint water limits 
(geocoded) from April 2014 to end date 
unknown (extend 9 months for fetal exposure). 

• Per census data, approx. 8,000-9,000 children 




Quick Introduction to 





Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) 

• ACEs are potentially traumatic events that can have 
negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. 

• Also referred to as toxic stress or childhood trauma. 

• As number of ACEs increase, the risk for health 
problems increase in a strong and graded fashion. 

• An ACE score of 6 or more results in a 20 year 
decrease in life expectancy. 

• CDC ACE study 

• Kaiser Permanente from 1995 to 1997 with more than 
17,000 participants.

ACE/Toxic Stress 

• Many chronic diseases/disparities in 
adults are determined decades earlier, by 
experiences in childhood (0-6 critical) 

• Lead exposure is an ACE/toxic stress 




u; HOW 











Now what can we do??? 


Assess the impact of the exposure 

• Health impact 

• BLL 

• Longitudinal neurodevelopmentalf/u 

• Cord blood Pb, brain injury markers, epigenetics 

• Retrospective fetal deaths, IUGR 

• Nutrition impact 

• Psychosocial impact 

• Water quality/infrastructure impact 


Continued monitoring 

• Academic/publichealth collaborations

Mr. Baird and all the other guys, 

it was a pleasure meeting everyone and a privilege to present to you all. As I said, we have an incredible and 
unique opportunity to mitigate the impact of this population-wide exposure. If we act now, proactively, we can 
buffer our kids from the life-altering impacts of lead poisoning. 


Flint has many claims to fame (we put the world on wheels, we birthed Mr. Baird!, etc); and now, with your 
leadership, we can continue to build generations of strong, smart, and healthy children.

Colleagues: 

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in 
response to questions mostly posed by Sen. Jim Ananich's office (the 
auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The questions 
came as the OAG conducts an audit of the Office of Drinking Water and 
Municipal Assistance's handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA 
pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint River as an interim water source. 
But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency 
purposes in 2006. The treated water met safety standards in quarterly 
tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint had never tested its effect on the 
distribution system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an 
effort to conceal information, only one email exchange raised red flags. 
The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control 
program; the DEQ responded the city had an optimized program in 
place. But in April the EPA asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion control. DEQ 
later explained that its first response referred to its program to monitor 
a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two 
consecutive six-month periods to determine optimal corrosion 
treatment. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ 
willfully misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that 
ODWMA employees appeared to have notified management properly 
about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and 
Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the switch to Flint water, 
but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by 
doing two rounds of six-month monitoring on the new water source 
before determining optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with 
DEQ's interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open 
to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: corrosion 
controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have 
been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once 
the first round of six-month sampling results arrived in late March 2015 
and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 

DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability 
measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water samples from tier 1 
homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or plumbing. 


2 



Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's certification of sample sites. The auditor 
suggests DEQ should consider an independent verification of the 
sampling pool or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, Flint admitted 
that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water samples 
came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked 
Flint to verify its prior samples by this Wednesday (12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with 
high lead levels from its second six-month review. It was appropriate for 
DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It was 
also appropriate for DEQ to require flushing taps the night before 
sampling to ensure faucets didn't contain overly stagnant water. 

Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of 
the six-month testing period. The report said it's tough to determine if 
the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy. 

The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in 
case you want to review the timeline on page 11.

The concern I have with having a local as a vice chair is that this is being pushed to the state level to 

fix. Similar to an emergency that reaches the state level, we need to have one lead to move this forward and 

that should be at the state level. I have run numerous state and federal disasters in this manner. The locals are 


pushing the request for resources to the state so this is them saying they cannot do anything more and handing 
this off to the state. This is one of the areas I mentioned that needs to stay consistent with the Emergency 
Management Act and how we manage incidents. 


Locals still have a voice in this (one way is that they are generating the requests for resources to assist).

Thanks for the opportunity to comment. I agree with Jim that it would be good to have a local entity at least be a 
co vice chair if possible. I would question statement of need wording and ask that it be reflect of the need for 
additional resources, integrated approach, additional professional expertise, enhanced 
communication, coordination and connection... you get the gist. Rich I would be happy to discuss at your 
convenience if appropriate. This would appear consistent with the request from Flint. Also in my limited (and I 
stress limited) discussions today I asked what success looked like and it included many of the suggested 
components. The individual I was speaking with wanted to further explore: 

Increased funding/focus for Head start to get ahead of the curve 

School nutrition and distribution systems (year around) 

Fresh produce/local foods 


Individual health screening 
Infrastructure improvements 


I know most if not all are identified in the outline but might want to further explain the nutrition component if 
the Docs in the group say it might be beneficial for those involved.

Today Harvey and I met with the Flint Water Task Force. It was a good meeting. People were 
pleased with the G’s statement from the prior day. Captain Kelenske joined us and we had a 
very good discussion about moving forward with the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency 
Coordinating Committee (FIACC). Tim Becker and Captain Kelenske provided me with a fair 
amount of input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for a State of Emergency

which Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I have distilled all 
of this into a two page plan that I want your edits and comments on and a one page 
organizational chart (now presented in the “governor’s colors” according to our fine people in 
Communications). Spoiler alert — I made Captain Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole shebang 
(with the Colonel’s blessing) so Harvey wouldn’t get lonely. 


Here is my ask of you: 


1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the Governor either 
New Year’s Day or Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday (Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the meeting January 7 
along with financial resources that we still need some estimates on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change the narrative 
focus on Monday’s Genesee County declaration of emergency 


I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge period but I do 
appreciate everyone’s efforts and I know the Boss really does as well.

Rich

Kelenske joined us and we had a very good discussion about moving forward 
with the creation of the Flint Water Crisis Agency Coordinating Committee 
(FIACC). Tim Becker and Captain Kelenske provided me with a fair amount of 
input. I also read the City of Flint Incident Action Plan for a State of Emergency 
which Chris received today (enclosed for those who wish to read it as well). I 
have distilled all of this into a two page plan that I want your edits and comments 
on and a one page organizational chart (now presented in the “governor’s colors” 
according to our fine people in Communications). Spoiler alert — I made Captain 
Kelenske Vice Chair of the whole shebang (with the Colonel’s blessing) so 
Harvey wouldn’t get lonely. 


Here is my ask of you: 


1) Within 24 (sooner if you can) hours give me your comments and input 

2) Tomorrow I will turn around a final document for Jarrod to review with the 
Governor either New Year’s Day or Saturday 

3) Ideally, Governor will approve Harvey sending it to Mayor Weaver Saturday 
(Sunday latest) 

4) Mayor needs to know that this is what the Governor wishes to discuss at the 
meeting January 7 along with financial resources that we still need some estimates 
on cost from DHHS for 

5) Meegan and Dave need to noodle how best to get out front with this and change 
the narrative focus on Monday’s Genesee County declaration of emergency 


I know we are all working way too hard for what should be a rest and recharge 
period but I do appreciate everyone’s efforts and I know the Boss really does as 
well.

Please don't confuse engagement with leadership. We will guarantee engagement and partnership. We do not 
to syndicate leadership. If we need to talk real time let me know. We are in listen mode right now. But I can 
assure you, we are going to be held accountable and that means we get to retain leadership that ensures 
engagement AND action. Trust me on this amigo.

The concern l have with having a local as a vice chair is that this is being pushed to the state 
level to fix. Similar to an emergency that reaches the state level, we need to have one lead to 
move this forward and that should be at the state level. 1 have run numerous state and federal 
disasters in this manner. The locals are pushing the request for resources to the state so this is 
them saying they cannot do anything more and handing this off to the state. This is one of the 
areas I mentioned that needs to stay consistent with the Emergency Management Act and how 
we manage incidents. 


l 



Locals still have a voice in this (one way is that they are generating the requests for resources to 
assist}.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment. I agree with Jim that it would be good to have a local 
entity at least be a co vice chair if possible. I would question statement of need wording and ask 
that it be reflect of the need for additional resources, integrated approach, additional professional 
expertise, enhanced communication, coordination and connection... you get the gist. Rich I would 
be happy to discuss at your convenience if appropriate. This would appear consistent with the 
request from Flint. Also in my limited (and I stress limited) discussions today I asked what 
success looked like and it included many of the suggested components. The individual I was 
speaking with wanted to further explore: 

Increased funding/focus for Head start to get ahead of the curve 

School nutrition and distribution systems (year around) 

Fresh produce/local foods 


Individual health screening 
Infrastructure improvements 


I know most if not all are identified in the outline but might want to further explain the nutrition 
component if the Docs in the group say it might be beneficial for those involved. 


Thanks again-Keith

Recommendations for the Revision of City of Flint EM Orders 3 and 20 
EM Order #3 City of Flint.docx; EM Order #20 City of Flint.docx 


Wayne, 

Per our conversation, I took the liberty of editing Orders 3 and 20. Please note the attached documents are still in 
tracking mode so you can see the edits. We would like to proceed fairly quick on revising these orders. The Governor 
meets with the Mayor on the 7 th , and I would like to inform him about the progress of these revisions. When we last 
spoke, you also mentioned Order #10; however, that order deals only with city council meetings. If there are other 
things you need to amend in order to make this happen, I trust that you will do so. I am asking Stacie to schedule a call 
with you on Monday. 

Thank you very much in advance. Have a great weekend. 

Best, 

Harvey

New release on blood lead level testing in Flint. 


Good afternoon Governor and team, 

Just wanted to give you a heads up about a release DHHS is issuing today with updated 
blood lead level testing. About 500 more people have been tested since the last release, 
and eight more people had elevated levels. 

The format and information is similar to the previous release. DHHS plans to issue such 
updates every three weeks for the time being to show transparency, remind people that 
testing is available if they are concerned, and that free filters and replacement cartridges 
are available. 

I've pasted the release below. 

Have a nice weekend, 

Dave 


December 11, 2015 

MDHHS releases latest round of Flint blood lead level data 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued 
its newest summary report on lead testing in Flint. According to preliminary data, 39 of 
1,836 adults and children tested had elevated blood lead levels since Oct. 1. 

“As testing continues, our focus remains on helping families reduce all potential exposures 
to lead,” said Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive. “We are working closely 
with the Genesee County Health Department to provide information and offer tools in the 
community, and encourage families to explore the resources that are available to them.” 

Both capillary and venous blood tests are included in the report, and people who have had 
multiple tests are counted only once. Tests and their results cover the time since the state 
action plan was put in place on Oct. 2, and capture the number of elevated blood lead 
levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter. 


l 



MDHHS is working closely with local partners to offer resources and distribute important 
lead testing and prevention information. Additional state funding has allowed for Genesee 
County Health Department (GCHD) nurses to work with families when an elevated blood 
lead level is detected. These families can also choose to have the nurse coordinate an 
environmental health investigation in their home to identify lead exposures, which could 
be lead from paint, soil, plumbing, and other sources. 

To support these efforts, the state is coordinating with its Medicaid health plans and 
provider communities on enhanced screening and testing. In addition to mandated testing 
at ages one and two for the Medicaid population, MDHHS has recommended blood lead 
testing for any child younger than six years of age in Flint who has not previously been 
tested. The state, in coordination with GCHD, developed and issued a Health Alert 
Network (HAN) notification for local providers to help ensure consistent messaging and 
protocols among primary care providers. 

Free water filters and replacement cartridges are still available to Flint residents. For a full 
list of locations and hours of distribution, or to view the full blood lead level report, visit 
www. mic hi g a it . go v/fli ntwater . The summary will be updated as more data becomes 
available. 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the 
original when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional video on its YouTube 
channel. For this and other updates, visit www.michigan.gov/fllntwater.

Subject: BRIEFING: Auditor General answers on Flint water situation 

Attachments: Auditor General Letter - City of Flint Drinking Water (002). pdf 


Colleagues: 

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly posed by Sen. Jim 
Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The questions came as the OAG conducts an 
audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint River as an interim 
water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency purposes in 2006. The treated 
water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint had never tested its effect on the distribution 
system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only one email 
exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control program; the DEQ 
responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion control. DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its 
program to monitor a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month 
periods to determine optimal corrosion treatment. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully 
misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have notified 
management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the 
switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six-month 
monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: 
corrosion controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month sampling results 
arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 

DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water 
samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's 
certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should consider an independent verification of the sampling pool 
or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water 
samples came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this 
Wednesday (12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six-month review. It 
was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It was also appropriate for DEQ to 
require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't contain overly stagnant water. 

l 



Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. The report said it's 
tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy. 


The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in case you want to review the timeline on page 
11 .

State Capitol, Room S-105 
Lansing, Michigan 

Dear Senator Ananich: 

Enclosed are answers to the questions you posed in your October 20, 2015 letter to our 
office regarding the audit we are conducting of the Office dt Drinking Water and Municipal 
Assistance (ODWMA), Department of Environmental Ouality (DEQ), specific to lead 
contamination in the City of Flint's drinking watef, Also enclosed are additional questions 
we developed that are relevant to these issues, along with five exhibits: 

• A map showing Flint water simples byi zip code. 

• A map showing lead counts of 5 partsiper billion or higher. 

• Two charts showing the number of samples by time period and zip code. 

• A time line of the Flint water review. 

We appreciate the opportunity to assist you in answering questions regarding this topic. If 
you have further questions or a request for other services, please do not hesitate to 
contact our officeTT J 

isix. Sincerely, 


Doug Ring I er

Q1 : How does ODWMA ensure the data it receives is accurate? 

A: With regard to the United States Environmental Protection A genc y (EPA) Lead 
and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring requirements, DEQ relies on the following key 
controls to ensure the accuracy of test results: 

• State-owned laboratories test water samples, 

• State-owned laboratories send test results directly to QSDL 

• The City of Flint Water Treatment Plant (Flint WTP) certifies whether 

sample sites are classified as tier 1*, 

The current Flint WTP LCR sampling process includes 

1 . DEO informs the Flint WTP of the- required water lead and copper 
sample size. 

2. The Flint WTP determines the pool of tier 1 sites for sampling. 

3. The Flint WTP setectPHe sample. 

4. The Flint WTP sends out sample kits and instructions to residents for 
collecting water samples. j||§fl r '' : 

5. Residents leave samples and signed sampling forms outside their front 
doors. 

6. The Flint WTP employee picks up samples and forms from residents. 

X The Flint WTP efffpfbyee reviews sample forms for completeness. 

8. The Flint WTP employee sends samples to the State-owned 
laboratories. 

% State-owned laboratories test samples and provide results directly to 

I iIIIIeq. 

10. DEQ receives water lead and copper sample results, which include 
the following information: date collected, date received, address 
where collected, type of residence (e.g., single family or apartment), 
and sample point (e.g., kitchen sink or bathroom sink). 

\ 11. DEQ tracks, and follows up if necessary, the number of samples 

collected by the Flint WTP to help ensure that the required minimum 
number of samples are collected by the monitoring period deadline.

Page 1 


1 2. The Flint WTP submits lead and copper report to DEQ that certifies 
whether sample sites meet tier 1 criteria. 

13. DEQ prepares the LCR 90th percentile calculation report. 

During our review, we noted two potential improvements for the Flint WTP 
sampling process (see Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the 
OAG regarding tier 1 sample validity): 

• DEQ could verify that the sampling pool was limited to only tier 1 sample 
sites to ensure that the Flint WTP is in compliance with the LCR 

(Title 40, Part 141, section 86(a)(3) of the Code of Federal Regulations 
[ CFR ]). 

• DEQ could independently verify the validity of sample Mil fortifications. 


Q2: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who fail to l|||vv data 

verification protocols? A 

A: DEQ does not provide any direct oversight over the Flint WTP and, therefore, 
does not have any accountability measures over the Flint WTP's LCR data 
verification protocols. DEQ's data verification protocol for lead and copper 
water sampling is limited to verification that the WTP certifies samples 
submitted to the State-owned laboratories for analysts (see steps 7 and 1 2 in 
the Flint WTP LCR sampling process noted in Question 1 above). We did not 
identify any instances in which ODWMA staff failed to verify that submitted 
samples were certified by the Flint WTP. 


Q3: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who lie or 

misrepresent information to the EPA? 

A: As with all classified employees, ODWMA staff must adhere to the rules and 
regulations established by the Michigan Civil Service Commission. If any 
ODWMA staff were determined to misrepresent information to the EPA, they 
would be sybj^ot to Civil Service Rule 2-6, Discipline, which allows an 
appointing authority to discipline an employee for just cause up to and including 
dismissal. #e are not aware of any DEQ-established measures that are in 
addition to the Civil Service Rules. 

We gained access to the e-mail accounts of key DEQ management (DEQ 
Director, Deputy Director, ODWMA Chief, and other key ODWMA staff) 
extending back to January 1 , 2013. We did so to identify the key decision 
points and conversations that occurred leading up to and through the situation in 
Flint. Our review was also intended to determine whether State, Flint, or other 
officials attempted to conceal key test results or other information. 

We noted one e-mail exchange between DEQ and the EPA that appears to be a 
significant contributor to the concern that DEQ misrepresented information to 
the EPA. The EPA requested clarification on February 26, 2015 regarding the 
type of optimized corrosion control treatment the Flint WTP was using. DEQ 
responded on February 27, 2015 that the city had an optimized corrosion 
control program in place, but DEQ did not provide any program details. DEQ 
informed us that the Flint WTP corrosion control program included performing 


Page 2 



lead and copper monitoring for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 
whether corrosion control treatment would be necessary in the future. 

However, it appears the EPA interpreted corrosion control program to mean that 
corrosion control treatment was being performed. 

On April 23, 201 5, the EPA again inquired as to what the Flint WTP was doing 
for corrosion control treatment. DEQ responded on April 24, 2015 that the Flint 
WTP was not practicing corrosion control treatment. 

Based on our review of this and other e-mails, we have no specific reason to 
believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented the information to the EPA. 


Q4: What policies do DEQ and ODWMA have in place to escalate major infractions up 

the chain of command? 

A: We did not note any instances of major infractions (i.e., intentional disregard of 
policies, laws, regulations or specific directions) committed by DEQ staff during 
the course of our review. DEQ does not have a formal policy or procedure in 
place to escalate major infractions performed by ODWMA employees; however, 
our review of DEQ correspondence confirmed the e||pation of key issues up the 
chain of command related to the Flint situation, DEQ stated that its informal 
policy is for staff to notify the proper level of management of infractions to 
determine necessary action. 




Application of the LCR 

Q1 : How did the Flint WTP become the primary water supplier for th%City of Flint? 

A: Upon notification of the City of Flint's plans to switch to the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) in April 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewefage Department 
(DWSD) submitted a letter to the City of Flint stating that ft would terminate its 
agreement to provide water services on April 17, 2014. 

According to DEQ management, the Flint WTP attempted to negotiate with the 
DWSD to maintain it as the City of Flint water supplier; however, after 
negotiations were unsuccessful, the City of Flint notified DEQ through a permit 
request of its intent to operate the Flint WTP full time using the Flint Rivet. 
Although the Flint City Council voted in March 2013 it|:support of moving to the 
KWA pipeline, the vote was silent on the use of the Flint River as a temporary 
drinking water source. J||: || 

The Flint River was approved by DEQ in 2006 as a backup source of water for 
emergency purposes prior to the switch from the DWSD WTP to the Flint WTP. 
On a quarterly basis, the Flint WTP tested the treated Flint River water at the 
Flint WTP, which met water qualify standards; however, the Flint WTP did not 
test the water's effect on |||: ;; distribution system at consumer tap locations. 


Q2. Did DEQ consult with the EPA prior to determining how to apply the LCR? 

A: DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how to apply the LCR prior to 

implementing two consecutive six-month monitoring periods of the Flint WTP 
beginning July 1 , 2014, Based on p!§t experiences applying the LCR monitoring 
requirements, DEQ believed that it had appropriately applied the LCR 
requirements of a large water system. 


Q3: When Flint switched to the Flint River water source, should corrosion control 

treatment have been r|||jptained? 

A: We believe that corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 

According to the LCR, a water system can achieve optimized corrosion control if 
it submits results of tap water monitoring for two consecutive six-month 
monitoring periods with acceptable lead levels. However, a water system that 
has optimized corrosion control, and which has treatment in place, should 
x continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment. 

DEllpaff explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a 
new system, but as a new source. DEQ further stated that because the Flint 
River was a new water source and there was a change in chemicals needed to 
treat the new source, a corrosion control study was needed to determine the 
impact on the water distribution system. Therefore, it was DEQ's interpretation 
that two rounds of six-month monitoring were still needed to evaluate the water 
quality and determine optimal corrosion control treatment. 


Page 4 


The Flint water system had optimal corrosion control treatment when the DWSD 
WTP was the water supplier. Based on our review of notes from a July 21 , 
2015 EPA and DEQ conference call on DEQ's implementation of the LCR 
regarding whether the Flint WTP should have continued to maintain corrosion 
control treatment, it appeared that the EPA did not agree with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR. Region 5 EPA staff explained that they would talk to 
the EPA headquarters about the interpretation of regulations and believes that 
systems that have been deemed optimized need to "maintain" corrosion control. 
The Region agreed to provide supporting regulatory citation%|||the language 
about maintaining corrosion control. 

On November 3, 201 5, the EPA issued a memorandum stating that the LCR had 
differing possible interpretations; however, the EPA concluded that it is 
important for large water systems to take the steps necessary to ensure that 
appropriate corrosion control treatment is maintained at all times, thus ensuring 
that public health is protected. Based on this clarification, it appears that 
corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 


Q4: Should DEQ have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized corrosion r 

control treatment after the first round of six-month sampling results were above the 
lead action level of 5 parts per billion (ppb)? 

A: Yes. According to DEO's application of the LCR, within six months after the 
end of the monitoring period in which the water sample results exceeded the 
acceptable lead level, DEQ should have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing 
optimized corrosion contrlllleatment. 

The LCR states that the lead action level is exceeded if the lead level, as 
determined by the 90th percentile calculation, is greater than 15 ppb. If the 
lead action level is exceeded, water Systems are required to take additional 
actions Including educating the public about lead in drinking water as well as 
commencing lead service line replacement if the water system has already 
installed corrosion control and/or source water treatment. However, for water 
systems that have not yet implemented corrosion control treatment, they can be 
deemed to have optimized corrosion control without installing treatment if they 
can demonstrat'd lead levels below 5 ppb for two consecutive six-month periods. 

The first round of six-month sampling results was received in late March 2015. 
Because the results were 1 ppb over the lead action level of 5 ppb, DEQ would 
not be able to achieve two consecutive six-month periods below 5 ppb. 
Therefore, DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized 
corrosion control treatment. However, DEQ waited until the second round of 
sampling was completed (June 30, 2015) to assess whether water sample 
results improved. 

Water Samples 

Q5: Did D£Q verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected by the Flint WTP in the 

two roiMds of six-month samples? 

A: DEQ did not verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected. DEQ relies on 
the Flint WTP’s certification of sample sites and does not perform any 
independent verification of those certifications. 


Page 5 



In a November 19, 2015 Flint Journal article, the Flint WTP indicated that it did 
not have the ability to ensure that all sites were tier 1 . In fact, water samples 
came from the random distribution of 175 testing bottles without regard for 
whether the homes were at risk for high lead levels. DEQ issued a formal 
memorandum on November 9, 2015 requesting that the Flint WTP verify the 
classification of all prior sample items. The results are due back from the Flint 
WTP on December 30, 201 5. 


Q6: DEQ dropped two water sampling sites from its second six-month sample 

(January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015). Was this appropriate? 

A: Yes, it was appropriate for DEQ to drop these two water sampling sites. Federal 
regulation 40 CFR 141 .86(a) states: 

"... each water system shall complete a materials evaluation 
of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted: 
sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section . . . 

All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be 
selected from this pool . . . Sampling sites mayliqt include 
faucets that have point-of-use of point-of-entry treatment 
devices designed to remove inorgante contaminants." 

This regulation also requires that a water system's targeted sampling pool 
consist of only tier 1 sampling sites if an adequate number is available to meet 
monitoring requirements. 

According to federal regulation 40 CFR 141 .86(1), the State may invalidate a 
water sample if it determines that the sarrpf& v :was taken from a site that did not 
meet the site selection criteria, A sample invalidated per this regulation does 
not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels or toward 
meeting the minimum monitoring requirements. 

DEQ dropped one water sample stte from its 90th percentile calculations 
because the site was from a business that does not meet the tier 1 requirements 
of being a single-family or multiple-family residence. The second sample site 
was dropped because the home had a point-of-entry treatment device to filter 
contaminants, Based on the criteria specified above, it appears that DEQ’s 
rationale for dropping the samples from these two sites appropriately met the 
requirements for invalidating samples per federal regulation 40 CFR 141.86. 


Q7: Was flushing of the taps the night before drawing a sample an appropriate sample 

methodology? 

A: Yes. The LCR requires that samples be a first draw of water after six hours of 
: stagnation. The LCR does not indicate whether or not the water line should be 
flushed prior to collecting the sample. In the sample instructions, DEQ required 
preflushing to ensure that sampled faucets were not stagnant for an excessive 
period of time beyond the targeted six hours (e.g., rarely used faucets or when a 
horrifbwner has been gone for an extended period of time.) 

The LCR requires six hours of stagnation; however, it does not preclude DEQ 
from instructing residents to flush prior to stagnation. 


Page 6 




In calendar year 1992, the Flint WTP established a tier 1 sample site pool for LCR 
monitoring. With the change to the Flint River water, the Flint WTP needed to increase the 
pool of sample locations because of additional sampling requirements. The following 
exhibit documents the 2014 and 201 5 sample locations for LCR monitoring. Based on the 
data obtained during our review, we could not determine how the locations were selected 
or whether they were properly classified as tier 1 sample sites. 

As noted in Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the OAG, DEQ has 
requested the Flint WTP to verify the tier 1 classification of ail prior sample items.

Great summary. Thank you. 

Is this on publicly released yet? 

On Dec 24, 2015, at 8:07 AM, Holland, Meegan (GOV) <HoyafKiM wrote: 

Colleagues: 

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly 
posed by Sen. Jim Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The 
questions came as the OAG conducts an audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's 
handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint 
River as an interim water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency 
purposes in 2006. The treated water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint 
had never tested its effect on the distribution system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only 
one email exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion 
control program; the DEQ responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA 
asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion 
control. DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its program to monitor a new water 
source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 
optimal corrosion treatment. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully 
misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have 
notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring 
practices after the switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so 
correctly by doing two rounds of six-month monitoring on the new water source before determining 
optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that 
the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: corrosion controls already in 
place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month 
sampling results arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 


l 



DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is 
collecting water samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or 
plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should 
consider an independent verification of the sampling pool or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, 
Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water samples came from 175 
randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this Wednesday 
(12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six- 
month review. It was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It 
was also appropriate for DEQ to require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't 
contain overly stagnant water. 

Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. 
The report said it's tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy. 

The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in case you want to review the 
timeline on page 11.

Colleagues: 

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly 
posed by Sen. Jim Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The 
questions came as the OAG conducts an audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's 
handling of the Flint water crisis. 


Conclusions: 


While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint 
River as an interim water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency 
purposes in 2006. The treated water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint 
had never tested its effect on the distribution system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only 
one email exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion 
control program; the DEQ responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA 
asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion 
control. DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its program to monitor a new water 
source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 


l 



optimal corrosion treatment. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully 
misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have 
notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring 
practices after the switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so 
correctly by doing two rounds of six-month monitoring on the new water source before determining 
optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that 
the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: corrosion controls already in 
place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month 
sampling results arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 

DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is 
collecting water samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or 
plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should 
consider an independent verification of the sampling pool or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, 
Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water samples came from 175 
randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this Wednesday 
(12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six- 
month review. It was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It 
was also appropriate for DEQ to require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't 
contain overly stagnant water. 

Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. 
The report said it's tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy. 

The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in case you want to review the 
timeline on page 11.

Subject: Please provide feedback: Governor's statement on Flint water crisis 


Colleagues: 

Many of us have reached the conclusion that our messaging on the Flint water crisis has room for improvement. We 
haven't conveyed to citizens the depth of our concern over the situation. I've crafted a statement to be made by the 
Governor, and would like you to review it. 

This statement is meant to manage expectations on the timing of concrete conclusions (the task force report may not 
come out for another month at least) and to signal that action may come sooner than that (we plan to reach out to 
Mayor Weaver, for example, and perhaps hold a press conference with her in January announcing some next steps). 

Here is the statement: 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've read the report 
from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this crisis. I want Michigan to be the 
state that is known for the safest water in the nation. 

"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As they uncover more facts, it's 
clear to me we can do better. The report may take another month or so, but if we need to make changes more swiftly, I 
plan to take immediate action. 

"The bottom line is we'll take responsibility for our part in Flint's water crisis. I'm committed to partnering with all of the 
stakeholders who are as concerned about public health as I am. I vow to make sure that Flint citizens will have safe 
drinking water. And I'm so very sorry that this happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water filters, and 
help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to sit down in the next week to 
discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

"What happened in Flint is inexcusable. I want to assure residents there that we will work hard to make things right." 

Thank you, 

Meegan

Subject: Re: Please provide feedback: Governor's statement on Flint water crisis 


This is the best narrative I have seen that actually describes how we feel about the situation and our resolve to make 
things right. A few thoughts: 

We might think about a "lead in" to your second para in the statement. Something like "The bi-partisan task force has 
worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, State and Federal officials and complete an independent fact based 
analysis. They have reviewed hundreds of documents at all levels of government and from the public health science 
community and continue to do so. 

Para 3 might unintentionally suggest that there are public health stakeholders who are not as serious as the 
governor. This may be an overreach, but may I suggest 

"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for error in testing for lead and other 
toxins. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community. That is why I have directed my 
Directors of MDEQand DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on the Flint water issue to the state 
laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should be able to affirm that every testing protocol and 
conclusion validates that Flint citizens will have safe drinking water, and that we are doing everything possible to ensure 
proper monitoring and remediation of blood levels and physical or neurological impacts over the long term. And I want 
the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has happened." 

Nick and Dan might not like the "invite" but I spoken with them both and they of course will support whatever the Boss 
decides.

I totally agree with going so far as to specifically apologize. I also like Rich's suggestions. The statement should convey 
three main points: 1) very sorry with no excuses 2) open and transparent 3) urgency in action steps going forward. 

I think this statement accomplishes those goals.

Subject: Update on OAG letter and our statement 


Colleagues, 

The Office of the Auditor General has released the letter. We've developed a statement, based on the 
summary you read the other night, that spells out how things came down. We hope media will pick up on the 
fact that the DEQ was largely following protocols, or in one case, an ambiguous one that EPA later clarified. 

FYI - Sen. Ananich has released the following in regard to the OAG letter: "The Auditor General has provided 
an important piece of this puzzle and I'm sure the extended report they are working on will reveal additional 
information," said Ananich. "What's clear is that corrosion control should have been used and there are 
serious failings in our system that must be addressed. Between the FOIA emails released recently and these 
findings, it's obvious that legislative oversight is the best way to see how all of these pieces fit together. I 
expect holding hearings to be high on the agenda when the Legislature returns." 

On Tuesday, we plan to release this statement by the Governor. It's been tweaked slightly since our review the 
other night, thanks to feedback from the Governor, Jim Redford and others. 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've read the 
report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint water. 

"The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and federal officials 
to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing hundreds of documents at all levels of government

Flint water statement 


Here is a statement from the Governor that will go out around 2-2:30 p.m. to the media. We'll also give a heads up to 
executive staffers and some others. - Meegan 


When I became aware that the city of Flint's water showed elevated lead levels and that the state's handling of the 
situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the Great Lakes Water Authority and 
appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 

The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of Flint, Genesee 
County, state and federal officials. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, it has made me aware of some interim findings and 
corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe 
and informed. 

We'll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns. 

In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I've determined that it's appropriate to accept it. 
I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force. 

But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific 
community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services 
to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping us improve Flint water. Let's 
share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at accurate and mutually supported 
conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint 
residents have safe drinking water and that we're taking steps to protect their health over the short and long term. 

I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan citizens to know 
that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure. 

I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That's why I'm taking the actions today to ensure a 
culture of openness and trust. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in 
other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state 
can offer assistance. 

These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our task force. 

When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything we can to protect the well- 
being of our citizens.

FYI- Release going shortly re: Flint Emergency Declaration 


Good afternoon, 

Just wanted you all to know that we're issuing the following press release shortly regarding the Governor declaring an 
emergency in Genesee County and activating the State Emergency Operations Center. The declaration will be attached 
with it. 

Thanks! 

Gov. Snyder declares emergency for Genesee County 

State Emergency Operations Center activated to assist with relief efforts 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today declared a state of emergency for Genesee County 
due to the ongoing health and safety issues caused by lead in the city of Flint’s drinking water. 

By declaring a state of emergency, Snyder has made available all state resources in cooperation 
with local response and recovery operations. The declaration authorizes the Michigan State 
Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division (MSP/EMHSD) to coordinate 
state efforts. 

“The health and welfare of Flint residents is a top priority and we’re committed to a coordinated 
approach with resources from state agencies to address all aspects of this situation,” Snyder said. 
“Working in full partnership with the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, all levels of government and 
water quality experts, we will find both short-term and long-term solutions to ensure the health and 
safety of Flint residents.” 

In addition to the emergency declaration, Snyder activated the State Emergency Operations 
Center to coordinate state response and recovery activities. State agencies will report to the 
center to coordinate resources, assess the situation and begin providing assets to assist with local 
relief operations. 

“Our staff recognizes the urgency of this situation and is already working closely with local 
officials,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, Deputy State Director of Emergency Management and 
Homeland Security and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. “We will continue to collaborate with 
state, city and county leaders to coordinate relief efforts, streamline communication and use all 
available resources to help residents.” 

On Jan. 4, Genesee County declared a “local state of emergency,” which activated local 


i 


emergency response and recovery plans. By requesting a governor’s declaration, the county has 
determined local resources are insufficient to address the situation and state assistance is 
required to protect public health, safety and property to lessen or avert the threat of a crisis. 

The city of Flint has been under a local emergency declaration since Dec. 14, 2015. 

The SEOC is the emergency operations center for the state of Michigan. Located in Lansing, the 
center is overseen by the MSP/EMHSD and coordinates response and recovery efforts by state 
agencies and local government. The SEOC is staffed by members of state agencies and other 
partners for decision making and information coordination during disasters or emergencies in the 
state of Michigan.

Attachments: Flint Background for Governor.pdf 


I have attached the general Flint update from Treasury. There is a brief paragraph about the water issue, but we are 
looking for a briefing specifically on the water issue. 

The Governor has a meeting in the morning with the Mayor, EM, City Administrator, and President of City Council where 
the water issue may be brought up. However, Col. Etue will also be attending so they will be discussing other topics 
concerning Flint (which is why I have the general update from Treasury). MSP is getting me a general update too. 

Brian Larkin is working on the agenda and a briefing for the couple morning meetings in Flint. 

For the afternoon meeting - we need a briefing on the combined Flint/Detroit water issue. 

Please let me know if you have further questions. 

Thank you, 

Melanie

O.K. I was confused- Bill is working on one for Flint, but can also do one for the Detroit meeting if needed. He is working 
with Brom at Treasury on the Flint briefing. HOWEVER, he thought Wendy may have also requested something from 
Treasury for tomorrow's Detroit meeting since Dennis set it up. Staci do you have anything to add to this?

City of Flint Background Information 



Pursuant to your request I am providing a status report regarding important issues facing the city. 
BUDGET 

The administration anticipates the FY 2013 budget will remain balanced through die end of 
the fiscal year. 

- The current budget reduced the City’s workforce by 150 positions (20 percent). 

- The City’s five year deficit ehmination plan anticipates an emergency loan application of $12 
million to address the $19.3 million accumulated deficit. The remainder of die unrestricted 
accumulated general fund deficit will be eliminated through $7.1 million in reductions. 

- The administration anticipates the FY 2014 will be balanced by making $3 million of 
reductions despite a 14% loss in taxable value. 

- 70% of the General fund expenses are for Police, Fire, 911 and the Court. 

- Ernst & Young will assist the EM is preparing a 5 year financial plan in accordance with 
the DEP. 

POLICE 

Voters approved a 6 mill public safety millage in November and 6 police officers have been 
hired to date and 5 positions still remain to be filled. 

Reorganization of the FPD has reduced response times and increased the rate of solving 
homicides to 70%. 

City successfully allowing out-county units to use the city’s lock up. 

MSP continues to provide 24/7 support to the city and will increase staffing from 18 to 25. 


FIRE 

Average number of fires per day 5-7. 

New Fire Chief hired, former Flint fire employee. 

False alarms are down 75% after EM began billing alarm companies for false alarms 

BLIGHT 

The city has 9,000 vacant structures 
Over 600 structures have been demolished

City is losing demolition money because Consumers Power cannot provide adequate 
manpower to cut & cap due to union issues. 

MSHDA is applying for $100 million in demolition funding for 5 local units including 
Flint. Anticipate work beginning this summer if grant application is successful. 

WATER 

EM signed a resolution to enter into and sign a contract with KWA. 

Water theft is a significant issue and administration plans to address it in the next 90 
days. 

Water rates have been raised 118% over the past 2 years and is an issue with residents 
Effective 7/1/13 EM will eliminate the “readiness to serve charge” ($53) for any water 
customer who meets the state poverty exemption requirements. 

DWSD attempting to cancel current contract with Flint and institute increased charges to 
the city during construction of KWA. 

PENSION 

Overall annual contribution is $17.4million, which has increased as work force has been 
reduced. 

General fund annual contribution is approximately $8 million. 

SOLID WASTE COLLECTION 

- City outsourced collection of solid waste during March 2013, the low bidder hired 20 
former DPW employees and the transition has been seamless. The firm will provide 
recycling this summer. 

OPEB LAWSUIT 

- A Federal District Judge recently granted (6 retirees) plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary 
injunction in response to changes implemented to retiree healthcare by the former EM. This 
action stops die modifications to the City of Flint’s retirees’ health care benefits from going 
into effect. 

MAYOR AND COUNCIL 

The EM has restored the Mayor’s salary and intends to reinstate the salary of city council. 
Council’s restoration will be predicated upon complying with certain criteria (training, 
active cooperation with the EM and consideration of major city initiatives i.e. master 
plan, KWA). 




The City of Flint continues to face challenges from an extended economic downturn which has resulted in 
continued significant decline in property valuations, population loss and an aging infrastructure 

► Economic headwinds 

► Property valuations have decreased 50% since 2002 to from ~$1,800 million to ~$900 million in 2012 

► The City's population has declined 18% to 102,434 in 2010 since 2000 

► The housing vacancy rate is 21% 

► The owner occupied housing rate is 45% 

► Retiree related expenses escalating 

► The City of Flint currently provides healthcare benefits for 1,560 retirees costing approximately $17,000 per employee 

► On March 29 th , a Detroit Federal District Court judge issued a temporary injunction against changes to retiree healthcare 
benefits 

► 1,741 individuals participate in the City's pension plans. All retiree pension plans are expected to be transferred from the Flint 
Employees' Retirement System to the Michigan Employees' Retirement System 

► The current unfunded OPEB liability stands at $367 million as of June 30, 2012 and the Pension UAAL stands at ~$268 million as of the 
2010 actuary report. 

► Increased property tax millage and fees proposed to result in $25 million of additional revenue to balance FY 2012 budget 

► 25% increase in Water and Sewer rates 

► 6 mill property tax increase for Fire and Police to provide funding in lieu of lost grant revenue 

► Special assessment for street lighting 

► Addition of waste collection fee to replace existing millage 

► $21 million reduction in personnel expenses for FY 2013 budget intended to balance the budget 

► $17 million reduction through wage concessions and headcount reduction 

► Budget assumes 20% reduction across all bargaining units although only 3 of 6 BU's have agreed to date 

► $4 million savings from converting the pre-65 retiree health benefit plan to the active's plan and transferring post-65 retirees to 
Medicare Advantage (these changes are subject to the temporary injunction)

While leadership has implemented changes that will begin to shape Flint's future, a long-term view must be canvassed 
to determine required levels of reinvestment resulting in an improved quality of life ("QOL") for citizens 


Short-term fiscal changes 

The City of Flint has made many fiscal changes to balance the 
budget and reduce the deficit including: 

• Increasing certain taxes and fees to cover the operating 
costs of Flint's core services 

• Reducing headcount 

• Working with labor and sharing sacrifice across pension 
and healthcare benefits to generate savings 

• Updating IT infrastructure as well as reviewing back-office 
and shared services to drive efficiency 


Investing for a sustainable future

Long-term reinvestment for sustainable future 

The City's 5-year plan must now turn towards sustainability to 
ensure the long-term plan will be in the best interest of the 
citizens 

• What levels of reinvestment in infrastructure and 
community development will attract jobs and population 
growth? 

• When and how should capital be deployed to maintain 
fiscal stability and foster change 

• What additional changes can be made to provide the

Flint Water System 

DATE: 

April 18, 2013 


Governor, this information was compiled by the Department of Treasury. 

Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, 
Inc. (TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & 
Sewer Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The 
purpose of this study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency 
Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the 
City of Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were 
presented: These options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of 
untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or 
provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and 
Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report 
by TYJT in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA's principal engineering firm regarding the others' 
conclusions and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the Office of Financial Review (OFR) provided a comprehensive report to the State 
Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the 
projections provided by Flint/KWA were acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; 
and 3) Identification of the options Flint will utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay 
in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA 
presented the best future option for future potable water. The OFR also concluded that KWA appeared 
to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee County appeared willing to 
assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA project could signify the 
beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and the KWA project 
had both political and popular support. 


1 




Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and 
Flint officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of 
the KWA project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron 
intakes. This bid opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the 
KWA system. The bid was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain 
them as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, 
pending review of any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a "supply only" rate schedule. Only 
water treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and 
operating revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand 
upon DWSD's Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own 
transmission lines. 

The second option was a "full service" rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be 
calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD's final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum 
annual rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 
60 MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given "broadened representation," it is 
unclear exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to 
maintain its WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an 
adequate backup supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total 
cost of this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not 
clear, so analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. 
As such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 


i 



Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, 
environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and 
Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, 
public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the 
state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the 
MEC for six years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan 
Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having 
joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public 
Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community 
Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served 
as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as 
Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the county’s 
bankruptcy and issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of 
Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, 
wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Children’s Health 
Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice 
for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

I have attached the general Flint update from Treasury. There is a brief paragraph about the water issue, but we are 
looking for a briefing specifically on the water issue. 

The Governor has a meeting in the morning with the Mayor, EM, City Administrator, and President of City Council where 
the water issue may be brought up. However, Col. Etue will also be attending so they will be discussing other topics 
concerning Flint (which is why I have the general update from Treasury). MSP is getting me a general update too. 

Brian Larkin is working on the agenda and a briefing for the couple morning meetings in Flint. 

For the afternoon meeting - we need a briefing on the combined Flint/Detroit water issue. 

Please let me know if you have further questions. 

Thank you, 

Melanie

O.K. I was confused- Bill is working on one for Flint, but can also do one for the Detroit meeting if needed. He is working 
with Brom at Treasury on the Flint briefing. HOWEVER, he thought Wendy may have also requested something from 
Treasury for tomorrow's Detroit meeting since Dennis set it up. Staci do you have anything to add to this?

City is losing demolition money because Consumers Power cannot provide adequate 
manpower to cut & cap due to union issues. 

MSHDA is applying for $100 million in demolition funding for 5 local units including 
Flint. Anticipate work beginning this summer if grant application is successful. 

WATER 

EM signed a resolution to enter into and sign a contract with KWA. 

Water theft is a significant issue and administration plans to address it in the next 90 
days. 

Water rates have been raised 118% over the past 2 years and is an issue with residents 
Effective 7/1/13 EM will eliminate the “readiness to serve charge” ($53) for any water 
customer who meets the state poverty exemption requirements. 

DWSD attempting to cancel current contract with Flint and institute increased charges to 
the city during construction of KWA. 

PENSION 

Overall annual contribution is $17.4million, which has increased as work force has been 
reduced. 

General fund annual contribution is approximately $8 million. 

SOLID WASTE COLLECTION 

- City outsourced collection of solid waste during March 2013, the low bidder hired 20 
former DPW employees and the transition has been seamless. The firm will provide 
recycling this summer. 

OPEB LAWSUIT 

- A Federal District Judge recently granted (6 retirees) plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary 
injunction in response to changes implemented to retiree healthcare by the former EM. This 
action stops die modifications to the City of Flint’s retirees’ health care benefits from going 
into effect. 

MAYOR AND COUNCIL 

The EM has restored the Mayor’s salary and intends to reinstate the salary of city council. 
Council’s restoration will be predicated upon complying with certain criteria (training, 
active cooperation with the EM and consideration of major city initiatives i.e. master 
plan, KWA). 



The City of Flint continues to face challenges from an extended economic downturn which has resulted in 
continued significant decline in property valuations, population loss and an aging infrastructure 

► Economic headwinds 

► Property valuations have decreased 50% since 2002 to from ~$1,800 million to ~$900 million in 2012 

► The City's population has declined 18% to 102,434 in 2010 since 2000 

► The housing vacancy rate is 21% 

► The owner occupied housing rate is 45% 

► Retiree related expenses escalating 

► The City of Flint currently provides healthcare benefits for 1,560 retirees costing approximately $17,000 per employee 

► On March 29 th , a Detroit Federal District Court judge issued a temporary injunction against changes to retiree healthcare 
benefits 

► 1,741 individuals participate in the City's pension plans. All retiree pension plans are expected to be transferred from the Flint 
Employees' Retirement System to the Michigan Employees' Retirement System 

► The current unfunded OPEB liability stands at $367 million as of June 30, 2012 and the Pension UAAL stands at ~$268 million as of 
2010 actuary report. 

► Increased property tax millage and fees proposed to result in $25 million of additional revenue to balance FY 2012 budget 

► 25% increase in Water and Sewer rates 

► 6 mill property tax increase for Fire and Police to provide funding in lieu of lost grant revenue 

► Special assessment for street lighting 

► Addition of waste collection fee to replace existing millage 

► $21 million reduction in personnel expenses for FY 2013 budget intended to balance the budget 

► $17 million reduction through wage concessions and headcount reduction 

► Budget assumes 20% reduction across all bargaining units although only 3 of 6 BU's have agreed to date 

► $4 million savings from converting the pre-65 retiree health benefit plan to the active's plan and transferring post-65 retirees to 
Medicare Advantage (these changes are subject to the temporary injunction) 


Restructuring Advisory Services I Pages 


While leadership has implemented changes that will begin to shape Flint's future, a long-term view must be canvassed 
to determine required levels of reinvestment resulting in an improved quality of life ("QOL") for citizens 


Short-term fiscal changes 

The City of Flint has made many fiscal changes to balance the 
budget and reduce the deficit including: 

• Increasing certain taxes and fees to cover the operating 
costs of Flint's core services 

• Reducing headcount 

• Working with labor and sharing sacrifice across pension 
and healthcare benefits to generate savings 

• Updating IT infrastructure as well as reviewing back-office 
and shared services to drive efficiency 


Investing for a sustainable future 


Attracting Population 


Long-term reinvestment for sustainable future 

The City's 5-year plan must now turn towards sustainability to 
ensure the long-term plan will be in the best interest of the 
citizens 

• What levels of reinvestment in infrastructure and 
community development will attract jobs and population 
growth? 

• When and how should capital be deployed to maintain 
fiscal stability and foster change 

• What additional changes can be made to provide the 
necessary capital for reinvestment?

Hi Dennis, 

John asked me to let you know that he has a House meeting on DPS this morning at 10:30 a.m. at the Capitol. He most 
likely won't make it back for the Flint meeting and he has asked Ari to cover it for him.

So as not to clog the email waves, just checking in with you 3 - statement looks good. I could be a two handed lawyer 
and argue both ways as to release - but in this case I am personally comfortable with a quicker release. 

BTW - our van is packed and the Walsh Detroit to Dallas or Bust trip is about to begin! Will be reachable by phone, and 
will check emails when I am not driving.

Subject: Update on OAG letter and our statement 


Colleagues, 

The Office of the Auditor General has released the letter. We've developed a statement, based 
on the summary you read the other night, that spells out how things came down. We hope 
media will pick up on the fact that the DEO was largely following protocols, or in one case, an 
ambiguous one that EPA later clarified. 


l 


FYI - Sen. Ananich has released the following in regard to the OAG letter: "The Auditor General 
has provided an important piece of this puzzle and I'm sure the extended report they are 
working on will reveal additional information," said Ananich. "What's clear is that corrosion 
control should have been used and there are serious failings in our system that must be 
addressed. Between the FOIA emails released recently and these findings, it's obvious that 
legislative oversight is the best way to see how all of these pieces fit together. I expect holding 
hearings to be high on the agenda when the Legislature returns." 

On Tuesday, we plan to release this statement by the Governor. It's been tweaked slightly since 
our review the other night, thanks to feedback from the Governor, Jim Redford and others. 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and 
I've read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to 
monitor Flint water. 

"The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and 
federal officials to complete its independent analysis. They are reviewing hundreds of 
documents at all levels of government and from the public health science community. 

"I'd like to thank the task force for keeping me apprised of their continuing investigation. As 
they uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. Their report may take another 
month or so, but if we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this crisis. 

"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything 
we can to protect the well-being of our citizens. 

"I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community. That is why I have 
told my directors at MDEQ and DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on the 
Flint water issue to the state laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we 
should be able to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint 
residents have safe drinking water and that we're doing proper monitoring and remediation of 
blood levels and other health impacts over the long term. 

"I want the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this 
has happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, 
distribute water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, 
and we're going to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the state can offer 
assistance. 

"I want to assure residents there that we will work hard to make things right."

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

• DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 
representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHFIS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 1 6, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 

• Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCFID) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCFID is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 

• DHHS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

EPA Establishes Safe Drinking Water Task Force to Provide Technical Expertise to MDEQ and City of Flint 

Task Force providing technical assistance on reconnecting the Flint drinking water system to a new source 

CHICAGO (October 16, 2015) - Today U S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman 
established the Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through regular 
conversations with designated officials from Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the City of Flint. 
The Task Force will be led by the Region 5 Deputy Regional Administrator and will assist with developing and 
implementing a plan to secure water quality, including measures to optimize corrosion control. Task Force members will 
be available to consult with MDEQ and the City of Flint on site in Flint. The Task Force will also coordinate as necessary 
with federal, state and local public health agencies to assist with protection of public health. 

Specifically, the Task Force will provide technical assistance to the MDEQ and the City of Flint to reconnect the Flint 
system to a new source of drinking water (to be supplied by the Great Lakes Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion 
control for the Flint system, starting in October 2015. The Task Force will also provide technical assistance to the MDEQ 
and the City of Flint, as needed, in advance of and following connection of the Flint water system to a new source of 
drinking water (to be supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion control for the Flint system, 
starting in 201 6. 

“EPA is committed to working with our state and local partners to ensure a safe and reliable drinking water supply for the 
residents of Flint, Michigan,” Hedman said. “The formation of this task force continues our commitment to providing 
technical assistance to the City of Flint and the State of Michigan.” 

The Task Force will be comprised of scientists and technical experts from the EPA Region 5 office in Chicago, 
the National Risk Management Research Lab in Cincinnati and the EPA drinking water program. In addition, EPA will ask 
the Governor to designate a MDEQ official and the Mayor of Flint to designate a city official, to serve as points of contact 
for the Task Force.

Region 5 

77 West Jackson Boulevard (R-19J) 

Chicago, Illinois 60604-3507 

Dear Dr. Hedman: 

This letter is being sent in follow up to an October 20, 2015, conference call 
between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Region 5, and 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The purpose of that call 
was to discuss Region 5’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force (Task Force) that was 
established to provide the USEPA’s technical expertise to the MDEQ and the city of 
Flint, Michigan. 

During that call, it was requested that the State of Michigan provide the USEPA 
with an MDEQ point of contact for the Task Force. This is to inform you of the 
designation of Mr. Jim Sygo, Chief Deputy Director, MDEQ, as that point of contact. 

Mr. Sygo may be reached at 517-284-6709; sygoj@michigan.gov; or MDEQ, P.O. Box 
30473, Lansing, Michigan 48909-7973. 

Thank you for your assistance in this matter as we work together to ensure a 
safe and reliable drinking water supply for the city of Flint. 

Sincerely, 


Rick Snyder 
Governor 

cc: Mr. Robert Kaplan, Deputy Regional Administrator, USEPA, Region 5 
Mr. Dan Wyant, Director, MDEQ 
Mr. Jim Sygo, Chief Deputy Director, MDEQ

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

• DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 
representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHFIS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 1 6, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 


• Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCFID) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCFID is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 


DHHS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

EPA Establishes Safe Drinking Water Task Force to Provide Technical Expertise to MDEQ and City of Flint 

Task Force providing technical assistance on reconnecting the Flint drinking water system to a new source 

CHICAGO (October 16, 2015) - Today U S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman 
established the Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through regular 
conversations with designated officials from Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the City of Flint. 
The Task Force will be led by the Region 5 Deputy Regional Administrator and will assist with developing and 
implementing a plan to secure water quality, including measures to optimize corrosion control. Task Force members will 
be available to consult with MDEQ and the City of Flint on site in Flint. The Task Force will also coordinate as necessary 
with federal, state and local public health agencies to assist with protection of public health. 

Specifically, the Task Force will provide technical assistance to the MDEQ and the City of Flint to reconnect the Flint 
system to a new source of drinking water (to be supplied by the Great Lakes Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion 
control for the Flint system, starting in October 2015. The Task Force will also provide technical assistance to the MDEQ 
and the City of Flint, as needed, in advance of and following connection of the Flint water system to a new source of 
drinking water (to be supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion control for the Flint system, 
starting in 201 6. 

“EPA is committed to working with our state and local partners to ensure a safe and reliable drinking water supply for the 
residents of Flint, Michigan,” Hedman said. “The formation of this task force continues our commitment to providing 
technical assistance to the City of Flint and the State of Michigan.” 

The Task Force will be comprised of scientists and technical experts from the EPA Region 5 office in Chicago, 
the National Risk Management Research Lab in Cincinnati and the EPA drinking water program. In addition, EPA will ask 
the Governor to designate a MDEQ official and the Mayor of Flint to designate a city official, to serve as points of contact 
for the Task Force.

Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Flint — The mayor of Flint is asking Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder for $30 million to help upgrade the city’s 
water system and replace lead service pipes. 

The Flint Journal reports Mayor Dayne Walling announced his request while speaking Monday to the City 
Council. The request was made that day in a letter to Snyder. 

The funds sought by Walling include $10 million to replace lead service lines and plumbing that can leach lead 
into drinking water. Virginia Tech researchers testing Flint’s water have said residents shouldn’t drink or cook 
with city water without flushing lines or using a fdter. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says Flint’s water is within levels allowed for lead. The agency has 
said it would help the city in its efforts to reduce lead.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

GENESEE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS DECLARE EMERGENCY 

Flint, MI — January 4, 2016 - During their first board meeting of the year, Monday morning, Genesee County 
Commissioners declared a state of emergency in Genesee County. The move a sign that county leaders support 
Flint Mayor Dr. Karen Weaver and her efforts to get resources and relief to the residents suffering from the 
ongoing water situation in the city. 

Mayor Weaver declared a state of emergency in Flint last month to raise awareness about the severity of the 
problems surrounding the water situation that continues to effect residents. The problems a result of the man- 
made disaster caused by the city switching to the Flint River as a water source in 2014. 

Following the board’s vote today, Genesee County Commission Chairperson, Jaime Curtis said, “This is a state, 
man-made disaster and we’re going to ask the state to fix their disaster. Curtis also said, "Genesee County is the 
fifth largest county in Michigan and we will not be ignored.” 


l 



Mayor Weaver hopes the county’s show of support will convince the Governor to provide the City of Flint with 
financial support to help leaders address immediate infrastructure needs. Those needs include more than $45 
million to replace every identified lead pipe in the city, reimbursement of the $2 million spent to switch back to 
the Detroit Water Sewerage Department, $6 million to help with the transfer to the Karegnondi pipeline and 
additional resources to support the city’s Fleath Initiative to assist affected adults and children in Flint who have 
consumed water contaminated with lead. 

In an interview with media after the board’s emergency declaration Mayor Weaver said, “It’s a victory and a 
step in the right direction.” The mayor plans to meet with Governor Snyder in Lansing Thursday of this week to 
discuss the state’s response and next steps.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water 
Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint 
water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint’s 
Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 
million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping the city on its 
water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health 
protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. 

I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the 
dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large 
bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff 
issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully 
optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from 
leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines 
or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 
Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and 
plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on 
Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office 
locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the 
Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in 
Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday.

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the 
water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing 
baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 
total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level 
of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled 
water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free 
testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at
