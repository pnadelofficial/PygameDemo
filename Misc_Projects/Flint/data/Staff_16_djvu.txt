SUBJECT: Status of Financially Stressed Local Governments 

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Flint 

Emergency Manager: Darnell Earley 
Appointed: November 28, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: April 2015 

Recent Developments 

- Emergency Manager Darnell Earley initiated a search for a qualified and experienced 
City Administrator. Ideally, the chosen candidate will begin on January 30, 2015. 

- Five Charter amendments and a general Charter revision question have been placed on 
the November 2014 ballot. These include eliminating the Office of Ombudsmen and 
Civil Service Commission, reducing mayoral staff appointments from ten to five, 
eliminating the requirement for specific executive departments, and requiring that the 
annual budget include a budget message, multi-year financial plans, revenue projections, 
and a Budget Stabilization Fund. 

The City has contacted the Michigan Health Endowment Fund at MDCH to determine if 
grant funds are available to start a fund to assist citizens who are unable to pay their 
water/sewer bills. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On September 5, 2014 a boil water advisory was issued due to multiple positive tests for 
“total coliform” covering approximately a 9 square mile area. This was caused from a 
broken valve which feeds the transition main. 

In August, Treasury staff met with the Mayor and City Council in one-on-one meetings 
to discuss the possibility of the Emergency Manager exiting in April 2015, and to explain 
the function of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. An April 2015 exit will not be 
possible if the pending retiree lawsuit outcome is unfavorable to the City. Decision date 
is still to be determined. 

Accumulated deficit for FY 2013 was $12. 9M; the City reduced the deficit by $3.9M to 
$9M in FY 2014 (unaudited). 

A $1.1M State appropriation was received to fund front-line public safety positions for 
FY 2015. 

The sale of the water pipeline for $3.9M was completed in June 2014.

The Genesee County 911 Consortium approved Flint’s return to the county-wide system 
by July 1, 2015. This will result in about $1M in annual savings to the City. Currently, 
the City spends $2.4M annually to subsidize its own 91 1 operations. 

The results of a comprehensive public safety study, being prepared by ICMA, will be 
available this fall. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

- Eliminate annual operating/ structural deficit which is projected at $1.7M for FY 2017, 
and grows to $1 1.9M by FY 2019 if the City loses the lawsuit over retiree healthcare. 

If the City loses this lawsuit, it will permanently add $5M annually to the cost of retiree 
healthcare. The City’s budget does not assume this additional $5M potential expense. 

Hamtramck 

Emergency Manager: Cathy Square 
Appointed: July 1, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: November 2014 

Recent Developments 

Both the Public Works Director and the Income Tax Director have been terminated for 
misfeasance; a replacement Public Works Director is being vetted, while the Income Tax 
Office has been outsourced to a third party. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- A firm has been hired to conduct a search for a qualified City Manager candidate. 

- The City closed on its emergency loan on September 23, 2014, which was approved by 
the Emergency Loan Board on June 26, 2014. The proceeds will resolve a $2.1M 
liability to MERS. 

- Retiree healthcare changes were implemented in December 2013 at a cost savings of over 
$1.8M. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 2015 to $4.3M 
in 2019. This resulted from the closing of certain pension plans and the MERS policy of 
accelerating the actuarial required contribution for closed plans. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 
Retiree healthcare litigation. 

- Hire a qualified City Manager. 

Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

SAFEbuilt was selected to perform building inspections for the City. Inspections were 
not being completed on a timely basis and the Building Inspector was terminated. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 3 


The Police and Fire pension plan is 30% funded. The General Employee plan is 22% 
funded. 

An Emergency Manager Order to charge $60 for each vehicle towed by the City will 
result in additional revenue of $100,000 per year. 

A Financial and Operating Plan was submitted to the Treasurer on August 22, 2014. The 
Plan’s proposal includes 1) Fire Department restructuring - $1M annual savings, 2) 
OPEB plan reform or elimination - $3.2M+ for duration of fiscal emergency, 3) CBA 
changes include sick, vacation, unused sick and vacation buy backs, average final 
compensation, etc. This will likely result in hundreds of thousands in annual savings, 4) 
health plan changes - $150K annual savings, and 5) outsource Building Department - 
$75K annual savings. 

- FY 2013 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $89K. In the prior FY, the 
City had a positive fund balance of $2M. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Police and fire contracts need to be renegotiated. 

Pension and OPEB funding. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

Emergency Manager: Kevyn Orr 
Appointed: March 14, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: November 2014 

Recent Developments 

- On September 25, 2014, Mayor Duggan and the City Council reached a deal to keep 
Kevyn Orr on as Emergency Manager until the court approves the City’s Plan of 
Adjustment. Mr. Orr’s remaining tenure is strictly limited to those actions necessary to 
bring the bankruptcy proceedings to a close. 

As part of this arrangement, Kevyn Orr signed an order to return all operational authority 
to the City. While most operational duties had already been returned, Kevyn Orr had 
continued to oversee the financial and budgetary functions of the City prior to September 
25,2014. 

- Mr. Orr also signed several orders to effectuate restructuring and consolidation of City 
functions. These included finance and budgetary functions, as well as information 
technology, planning, and grants management functions. 

While the court’s exact timeline cannot be known, it is anticipated that proceedings could 
end over the next 3-6 weeks. In preparation, Treasury is coordinating with the 
Governor’s Office to implement the new Financial Review Commission, which is 
required by the “Grand Bargain” legislation. This commission will help to ensure the full 
and timely implementation of the City’s Plan of Adjustment. 



Page 4 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On September 26, 2014, the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board 
approved exit financing for the City. This included the approval of four bond deals that, 
taken together, are worth up to $ 1 . IB. All bonds had been previously approved by City 
Council. 

On the same day, the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board also approved 
the Emergency Manager’s proposal to sell several properties in the footprint of the New 
International Trade Crossing to the Land Bank Fast Track Authority for a total of $ 1 ,4M. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

- Emergency Manager Joyce Parker exited on September 25, 2014 and a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board was appointed. 

A $2.6M emergency loan was approved by the Emergency Loan Board on September 23, 
2014 with the closing occurring the same day. The proceeds will be used to pay the 
delinquent pension obligation. Recent actuarial valuation revealed pension funding for 
General Employees at 79.2% and Police/Fire at 79.5%. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Future OPEB liabilities reduced by $48. 8M (33%). 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the Emergency Manager’s authority to reduce 
OPEB liabilities. A court date on this matter is pending. 

- The Southfield Lease Properties were sold on August 22, 2014 to Time Equities for 
$12M. 

A compliance settlement with SEC must be finalized. 

A five-year financial forecast must be developed within 90 days of the Emergency 
Manager exit. 

The restructuring of the Southfield Lease Properties Debt and Tender Offer must be 
completed. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Cary Vaughn, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The City submitted a $4.8M Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) which was approved by 
the RTAB on September 24, 2014. 

A litigation study was recently completed by UHY which will assist the City in 
improving its process of managing legal and litigation issues. 

Due to the resignation of another City Commissioner, a new vacancy has occurred on the 
City Commission. It is anticipated that the vacancy will be filled by November 2014. 



Page 5 


Significant Actions/Issues 

General Fund revenues are projected to exceed expenditures by $2.9M for FY 2014 
($2.3M from loan proceeds). 

The City Manager implemented a twelve-month operational plan to guide City 
operations. 

- Lawsuit filed against the City and former Emergency Manager Saunders by former 
Public Safety Director; alleges he was dismissed for complaining to the State. 

The Michigan Court of Appeals has ordered the Benton Harbor Mayor recall election off 
the November 2014 ballot. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The City continues to search for a qualified interim City Administrator, and is currently 
operating without one. 

The RTAB annual evaluation will be voted on at the November meeting; while some 
elements are positive or neutral, much of the report is negative. An eventual 
recommendation for the reappointment of an Emergency Manager is foreseeable. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- City Council repeatedly rejected a CGAP grant which would have saved the City $1M; 
offsetting the lost tax settlement revenue. 

Pension contributions are anticipated to increase from $1.8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 
2016. 

- The State has approved $750K in State Revolving Funds for a sanitary sewer project. 

- The RTAB rejected the City’s proposed five-year budget in June 2014 due to unrealistic 
projections. The firing of the City Administrator and the uncertainty of Plante Moran’s 
continued financial services have delayed the completion of a viable five-year budget. 
The amended budget completion date is unknown. 

Plante Moran has renewed their call for reform within the City (e.g. begin immediate 
search for permanent City Administrator, contract with neighboring community or an 
outside agency to provide HR services to the City). Plante Moran’s future with the City 
is in doubt due to the City’s failure to meet the conditions it previously agreed to. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was recently reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to 
Judge Avern Cohn. Judge Cohn has requested the parties participate in facilitation as a 
means to reaching a settlement. The City of Pontiac and the Retired Employees 
Association have agreed to participate in facilitation. 



Page 6 


In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. Interviews are tentatively scheduled on October 20 and 21, 2014. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

General Fund accumulated fund balance for FY 2014 is approximately $4M. 

The RTAB is currently reviewing the City’s proposed FY 2016 budget, which will be the 
City’s first adopted budget since the Emergency Manager’s required two-year budget. 
General Fund is structurally balanced in FY 2015 and expenditures are projected to 
exceed revenues by $360K. 

The $6M annual retiree healthcare obligation and related federal litigation must be 
resolved prior to August 2015, when the existing Emergency Manager Final Order 
regulating this issue expires. Expiration of this order would increase the annual cost of 
retiree healthcare to between S10-13M, which would be approximately one-third of the 
City’s $30M General Fund budget. 

The General Employee Retirement System application for tax exempt status was 
extended for another five year period by the IRS until December 31, 2019, as required by 
federal law. This extension resolves the issue of the proposed 420 Transfer and the 
RTAB has ceased review of the issue unless the City presents any new proposals. 

The City expects condemnation litigation involving the Phoenix Center building to be 
resolved in the near future. At that time, the City will proceed with the budgeted $2M 
demolition of the building. 

- The City Charter Commission has completed a draft of a new City Charter, which is 
under review by the Office of the Attorney General. The Charter will eventually have to 
be adopted by a vote of the electorate. A possible election date has yet to be determined. 

- The City Administrator has informed the RTAB that additional financial training for the 
City Council is needed.

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 
Consultant/Treasury Representative: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The consulting firm (UHY) is assisting the Consent Agreement Consultant and the 
Township in developing a Financial & Operating Plan. The Township has requested that 
the plan deadline be extended to November 1, 2014. 

The Township will be approving a new contract for waste disposal services in October. A 
10% cost reduction will be achieved under this new agreement. 

The State of Michigan, Bureau of Construction Codes ordered the Township Building 
Inspector to inspect and issue a report regarding the conditions at the Township’s 
Recreation Center. The report was ordered after Treasury contacted the Bureau of 
Construction Codes when receiving a complaint from a Township Parks Commissioner 
regarding possible health and safety violations at the Recreation Center. Treasury will 
receive a copy of any determinations issued by the Bureau of Construction Codes. 

The Township is planning to submit several applications to the new Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships grant program. 



Page 8 


Significant Actions/Issues 

The Michigan State Police continue to provide police services to the Township. 

A committee consisting of the Township Supervisor, Consent Agreement Consultant, and 
one Township Trustee continues to explore contracting for police and fire services. The 
Michigan State Police and Treasury are also involved with this process. The City of 
Ferndale and the City of Hazel Park have expressed interest in providing these services. 

A Deficit Elimination Plan is required for police, fire, and street lighting funds to address 
a total deficit of $547. 6K and was due by August 23, 2014. The Township has not yet 
submitted its Plan. 

On July 30, 2014, the Township submitted a Corrective Action Plan to address 
deficiencies identified in its FY 2013 Audit; Treasury is currently reviewing the plan. 
Surplus pension assets of $619K administered by MERS were transferred to the 
Township. The State Treasurer approved a Consent Agreement Order by the Township 
Supervisor prohibiting the use of these funds until the Financial & Operating Plan is 
approved. The Office of the Attorney General is reviewing the legal authority regarding 
the use of these funds for any purpose other than pension expenses. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION

in Financial Recovery Bonds, and 3.6M in State Revolving Fund bonds. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

- Liabilities total S117.6M - some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt (including 
$20. 7M owed to DWSD), $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded OPEB 
liabilities. 

The City defaulted on its State emergency loan payment due May 19, 2014. Treasury 
withheld $101K from State Revenue Sharing on June 30, 2014 to cover the default. 

A long-term lease of its 32-acre tree farm in Rochester Hills for $1M was announced by 
the City. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 
Melvindale 


Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, an increase of $248K from the FY 2012 
deficit. 

- The City’s ice arena unrestricted annual deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, which is 
approximately $160K more than what the City projected. It continues to negatively 
impact the General Fund. 

- The City met with Treasury representatives on August 19, 2014 to discuss the City’s 
proposed deficit elimination plan. The City provided a well-crafted plan and it is under 
review by Treasury. 

The City Council approved placing two millage proposals on the November ballot. The 
first is to pay the debt on the ice arena and the other is for street/sidewalk repair. 


Taylor 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund has an unrestricted deficit of $2.2M for FY 2013. 

The City made only 47% of its required annual contribution for OPEB. The unfunded 
liability is $232. 7M and continues to grow. 

There are several contingent liabilities that may impact the financial stability of the City, 
including the possible need to subsidize Brownfield Redevelopment Bonds of $14. 2M. 

A 1996 levy to pay a general obligation bond expires in 2015, potentially resulting in a 
$6.2M drain per year on the General Fund during FY 2016 and FY 2017. 

City of Wayne 

Recent Developments 



Page 10 


City Manager Joe Merucci resigned, effective October 11, 2014 and has taken an 
immediate leave of absence. 

Police Chief Jason Wright was appointed Interim City Manager on September 1 1, 2014. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

- Projected General Fund deficits for FY 2014 and beyond. 

The City is discussing a May 2015 ballot proposal that would seek voter approval for 
additional millage. 

The positions of Finance Director, Personnel Director, and Parks and Recreation Director 
are currently vacant. 

The Mayor of the City of Westland has publically expressed concern about the stability 
of the City of Wayne and the collaborative agreements between the two cities. 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

- In a letter from the Director of Labor Relations, the Director indicated that negotiations 
with all bargaining units have stalled. 

The County anticipates another short-term borrowing in December 2014 for $75M. Cash 
reserves reaches its lowest point in May 2015 with pooled cash falling to approximately 
$63M (average balance is $170M). 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The County submitted a revised DEP, approved by the County Commission, which 
removes the changes to retiree healthcare. The loss of the $9.2M in savings will be offset 
by the $10M anticipated increase in revenue sharing. County Treasurer agreed to transfer 
$150M from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to the General Fund. Of that $150M, 
$82M has already been transferred and applied to the accumulated deficit, and $44M has 
been applied to the operating/structural deficit in accordance with the DEP. The 
additional $24M, which was not part of the DEP, will be used to help reduce the 
accumulated deficit. 

Approval of the County’s revised DEP is on hold until the new Wayne County Executive 
takes office.

Hello Lome, 


Due to the water emergency in Flint, the Governor will not be able to attend the meeting we have scheduled for 
tomorrow. However, we would like to still host the Rear Admiral and your team at our office for the meeting with the 
other members of the Administration as planned. None of the logistics or attendees would change, except that the 
Governor would not be in the meeting. We could have them follow up with a phone call sometime in the near future. 


Could you please let us know if it is okay to proceed with the meeting tomorrow? 


We apologize for the change, 
Beth

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Allen Park 

Emergency Manager: Joyce Parker 
Appointed: October 26, 2012 
Anticipated Exit: September 2014 

Recent Developments 

- The sale of Southfield Lease Properties to Time Equities for $12M is expected to close in

review of the property which has delayed the closing. 

- The City has requested a $2.7M emergency loan, which will likely be considered by the 
Emergency Loan Board at an August meeting. If approved, proceeds would be used to 
pay the delinquent pension obligation. Recent actuarial valuation revealed pension 
funding for General Employees at 79.22% and Police/Fire at 79.5%. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A ten year, $6.7M Public Safety Millage was approved by voters in August 2013.

Overall deficit reduced to $9M in FY 2014. 

The Federal District Court Judge modified the preliminary injunction on June 30, 2014. 
(six retirees challenged modifications made by the Emergency Manager to retiree 
healthcare coverage). The City can implement cost saving measures pending the trial 
outcome. However, if the challenge stands, the City’s cost will increase by

FY 2015. 

- The Emergency Manager has imposed collective bargaining agreement terms that will 
save the City $336k annually with long-term projected savings of $4.3M effective July 
2014. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

- Eliminate annual operating/ structural deficit which is projected at $1.7M for FY 2017, 
and grows to $1 1.9M during FY 2019 if the City loses the lawsuit over retiree health.

Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

Chris Olsen offered City Administrator position (pending contract negotiations). 

The RTAB first annual evaluation is underway. 

Plante Moran has suspended their previous letter of termination, contingent on certain 
conditions, (e.g. begin immediate search for permanent City Administrator, contract with 
neighboring community or an outside agency to provide HR services to the City). 

Significant Actions/Issues 

City Council has repeatedly rejected a CGAP grant which would have saved the City 
$1M, offsetting the lost tax settlement revenue. 

Pension contributions are anticipated to increase from $1.8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 
2016. 

The RTAB rejected the City’s proposed five-year budget in June 2014 due to unrealistic 
projections. The firing of the City Administrator and the uncertainty of Plante Moran’s 
continued financial services have delayed the completion of a viable five-year budget. 
The amended budget completion date is unknown.

Melvindale 


Significant Actions/Issues 

The General fund deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, an increase of $248k from the FY 2012 
deficit. 

City’s ice arena unrestricted annual deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, which is approximately 
$160k more than what the City projected. It continues to negatively impact the General

debt on the ice arena and the other is for street/sidewalk repair. 


Taylor 



Page 8 


Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund has an unrestricted deficit of $2.2M. 

The City made only 47% of its required annual contribution for OPEB. The unfunded 
liability is $232. 7M and continues to grow. 

There are several contingent liabilities that may impact the financial stability of the City 
including the possible need to subsidize Brownfield Redevelopment bonds of $14. 2M. 

A 1996 levy to pay a general obligation bond expires in 2015, potentially resulting in a 
$6.2M drain per year on the General Fund during FY 2016 and FY 2017. 

City of Wayne 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Projected General Fund deficits for FY 2014 and beyond. 

Treasury prepared and presented recommendations for the City during April 2014. 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

Warren Evans defeated Robert Ficano with 44% of the vote in the primary election held 
August 5, 2014. 

- The County Finance Director continues to pursue the implementation of the Waste Water 
Authority by meeting with the affected local units and the attorneys for several of the 
existing systems. 

- The County believes it has sufficient documentation to support the County’s ownership 
of the various waste water systems. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Treasury met with County Finance officials on July 1, 2014 to discuss progress on the 
Deficit Elimination Plan (DEP). Another meeting is scheduled for August 18, 2014. The 
County submitted a revised DEP, approved by the County Commission, which removes 
the changes to retiree healthcare. The loss of the $9.2M in savings will be offset by the 
$10M anticipated increase in revenue sharing. 

County Treasurer agreed to transfer $150M from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to 
the General Fund. Of that $150M, $82M has already been transferred and applied to the 
accumulated deficit, and $44M has been applied to the operating/structural deficit in 
accordance with the DEP. The additional $24M, which was not part of the DEP, will be 
used to help reduce the accumulated deficit. 

The elimination of the accumulated deficit is dependent upon the transfer of excess funds 
held in the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund and the creation of a Wastewater Authority. 
The plan to eliminate the operating/structural deficit depends on significant labor costs 
savings and pension revisions. 


The Treasurer received letters from the law firm of Foster Swift and the Downriver 
Utility Wastewater Authority on behalf of several communities affected by the Waste 
Water Authority proposed in the County’s DEP. They expressed disagreement with the 
plan and also questioned the ownership of the assets. 



Page 9 


The County reduced the amount needed to borrow for general operating cash flow 
purposes from $100M to $75M. The Tax Anticipation note was issued on May 28, 2014 
and the proceeds were placed in escrow. 

The County received $25M of its cash flow borrowing of May 28, 2014 upon closing. A 
second draw in the amount of $25M was approved by Treasury on July 2, 2014 leaving a 
balance of $25M in escrow. Estimated final release date is expected to be by August 15, 
2014.

Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
1 i I. South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing,; Ml 411909 

Dear Governor Snyder: 

The City of Flint has been m a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
: i Changes have been implemented and! feeHhatthe 

Irpanclal epergeuey has; been I feel it is ipy pesitida as 

Emergency Manager pSM)' atdMg timer , 

As you ato atV:Ufe 5 Ew^- Jaawwy B, 2015. under the authority of PA. 

436 of 20 1 2. 1 am the fourth EM to Michael K, BfowhlEA 4 

and PA 430), Edward KurU(PA ?2 and PA 436) and Darnell Parley (PA 436). Each EM took major steps 
toward These steps meluded intplempuftag budgetary: and finanda! best 

praetteps. means and feels of serviee 

provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the tlrhO: of plaoeiuejA into state reoeivetsblpj the City of Ttint was. a city in financial crisis, ehmucierized: 
by acciuhnlated deficits : in the Oenefal Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and unsustainable legacy 
costs. At the cpnelusion of FY;12y the fiscal yearin whiohan Emorgency City -is 


General Frsnd deficit stood at $19. 1 cash How was 

$13 million, or less than one month's excuses, Unfunded OPEB liabilities were more that $850 million. 

AddiUssing these issues and. putting, Flint: hack onto: ts ptsth to sustain fimbtoMHote difficult 

for taxpayers,, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mil! special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street, lighting: 

for smdee front a milfage raid:, and increases in .utility rates to among 
t6 feels (Ineluding public 


Ci|y of Eliot « !lt>|.

safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrunk by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General Fund 
deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan Board. 
City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have been 
enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the requirement 
for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and maintenance of a 
biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund balance reserve, 
including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a requirement to begin 
funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over daily 
activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City operations have 
been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no longer being done 
internally, 911 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 2015, and the City- 
funded 68 th District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 67 th District Court in 
January, 201 6. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the Karegondi Water Authority 
instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective bargaining contracts have also 
been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the stage for permanent reductions 
in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the level of parks maintenance. 
Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, with reduced assistance from 
the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new Master 
Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has been 
completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new zoning 
ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces significantly 
engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the Flint City 
Council, with the support of the Mayor. 



Governor Snyder 
April 28, 2015

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current Charter 
and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which will be 
elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current Strong Mayor 
form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 

Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work on 
the part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit over 
its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is currently 
operating under a judge’s order which allows modification of the City’s historical level of health 
care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 

• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a long 
term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently provides is 
not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint’s total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This millage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago, are 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety services, even with the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This was recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 1 00 more officers on the street than Flint does.

Wayne and i discussed this further. I think it would be good if this group could meet early next week to have another 
discussion on Flint. 


The purpose of the meeting would be to discuss and finalize Flint RTA8 members, and also to discuss the potential 
ramifications of Rep. Kiidee's recommendation that the state forgive Flint's $22M water loan:

TO: Rick Snyder, Governor 

FROM: R. Kevin Clinton, Treasurer 

SUBJECT: Status of Financially Stressed Local Governments 

EMERGENCY MANAGER 

Flint 

Emergency Manager: Darnell Earley 
Appointed: November 28, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: April 2015 

Recent Developments 

- Two City Council seats will be vacant as of January 1, 2015 due to the members being 
elected to higher offices. A committee consisting of the Mayor and City Council is 
working with the Emergency Manager to review interested applicants for the vacant City 
Council positions. 

- City officials are attempting to increase the City’s income tax rate, which Treasury 
supports and must be approved by the legislature. State Representative Stanley is the 
lead on this initiative. Should the legislature approve the increase, the City will place this 
question on the November 2015 ballot. 

Six Charter amendments and a general Charter revision question were on the November 
4, 2014 ballot. The following proposals passed: 

o Proposal 1 - Triggers a full review of the charter. A nine-member Charter Review 
Commission will be elected in May 2015. 

o Proposal 2 - Reduces the number of mayoral staff appointments from no more 
than ten to no more than five. 

o Proposal 3 - Adds a Charter amendment to require budgetary best practices. 

Three finalists were selected for the City Administrator position. Background and 
reference checks are being conducted on the preferred candidate now, with a goal to 
bring the person on board in February 2015. 

City officials met last month with the DEQ, and as a result of that meeting, prepared an 
operational plan to reduce the formation of disinfection by-products. They have 
exceeded the standard which is primarily the result of using water from a different 
source, namely the Flint River. This is anticipated to be mitigated once the City begins 
using Lake Huron water from the Karagondi pipeline. A DEQ violation notice will go 
out next week which will require the City to issue a public notice. The violation is 
expected to continue for a while because it takes time to resolve this problem. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City has contacted the Michigan Health Endowment Fund at MDCH to determine if 
grant funds are available to assist citizens who are unable to pay their water/sewer bills.

The accumulated deficit for FY 2013 was $12. 9M; the City reduced the deficit by $3.9M 
to $9M in FY 2014 (unaudited). 

A $1.1M State appropriation was received to fund front-line public safety positions for 
FY 2015. 

The Genesee County 911 Consortium approved the City of Flint’s return to the county- 
wide system by July 1, 2015. This will result in approximately $1M in annual savings to 
the City. Currently, the City spends $2.4M annually to subsidize its own 91 1 operations. 
A comprehensive public safety study, being prepared by ICMA, is due by year end.

- Eliminate annual operating/ structural deficit, which is projected at $1.7M for FY 2017 
and grows to $1 1.9M by FY 2019 if the City loses the lawsuit over retiree healthcare. 

If the City loses this lawsuit, it will permanently add $5M annually to the cost of retiree 
healthcare. The City’s current budget does not assume this additional $5M potential 
expense.

changes affecting unused sick and vacation buy-backs, average final compensation, 
resulting in $100K+ in annual savings, 4) health plan changes - $150K annual savings, 
and 5) outsource Building Department - $75K annual savings. 

- FY 2013 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $89K. It is anticipated the

Adjustment. Mr. Orr’s tenure as Emergency Manager would end on this date as well (as 
of this writing, the effective date is expected to be December 10, 2014.

ensure ongoing fiscal stability in the City and compliance with the Plan of Adjustment. 
This body will have broad authority to review the City’s fiscal and operational decisions 
for a number of years to come. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr is expected to issue his final order and 2-year budget in

Significant Actions/Issues 

Emergency Manager Joyce Parker exited on September 25, 2014. 

Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the Emergency Manager’s authority to reduce 
OPEB liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending but was stayed by the 
judge through the end of the Detroit bankruptcy. No date has been set to hear this 
motion. 

A $2.6M emergency loan was approved by the Emergency Loan Board on September 23, 
2014. The proceeds were used to pay a delinquent pension obligation of the same 
amount. 

A compliance settlement with the SEC was finalized on November 6, 2014 related to 
bonds that financed the failed movie studio project. 

- Now that the Emergency Manager has exited, a five-year financial forecast and Capital 
Improvements Plan must be developed by December 15, 2014. 

City Hall will be relocating to a temporary facility in 2015 until a decision is made on 
whether to purchase an existing building or to construct a new facility. Before the City 
can temporarily relocate, internet connectivity and VOIP phone system issues in the 
temporary building need to be resolved.

approved the appointment on November 18, 2014. The City has contracted with the 
Michigan Municipal League (MML) to complete a full-time City Administrator search; a 
candidate is expected in 90-120 days.

recommend removal of RTAB oversight at this time. 

- Plante Moran has tendered their intent to separate from the City as of January 1, 2015.

offsetting the lost tax settlement revenue. 

Pension contributions are anticipated to increase from $1.8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 
2016 because of a MERS recalculation of closed funds. 

The State has approved $750K in State Revolving Funds for a sanitary sewer project. 

The RTAB rejected the City’s proposed five-year budget in June 2014 due to unrealistic 
projections. The amended budget completion date is unknown.

participating in facilitation. 

In April 2014, the Final EM Order was amended to create a Deputy Mayor position. The 
field of candidates has been narrowed to three, and a finalist will be selected by mid- 
December. 

Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the City’s condemnation 
lawsuit involving the Phoenix Center because the City failed to include compensation for 
the lien placed on the property. The City is preparing an appeal of the decision to the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Information has also come to light that suggests the 
condition of the Phoenix Center is not as bad as was officially reported. The Department 
of Treasury is investigating this issue.

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Melvindale 


Recent Developments 

The City requested approval to issue $2.24M in tax anticipation notes, which matures no 
later than September 1, 2015. Treasury approved the borrowing on November 13, 2014. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, an increase of $248K from the FY 2012 
deficit. 

The unrestricted annual deficit for the city-owned ice arena in FY 2013 is $1.9M, which 
is approximately $160K more than what the City projected. It continues to negatively 
impact the General Fund. 

- The Department issued a conditional approval of the City’s Deficit Elimination Plan. 
The City is required to submit monthly financial reports to demonstrate adherence to the 
plan. 

- The City Council approved placing two millage proposals on the November ballot. The 
first was a 2.07 millage levy to pay the debt on the ice arena. This proposal was soundly 
defeated with 66% of the vote. The second proposal was a 7.08 millage levy for 
street/sidewalk repair. This passed with 55% of the vote. 


Taylor 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund has an unrestricted deficit of $2.2M for FY 2013. 

The City made only 47% of its required annual contribution for OPEB. The unfunded 
liability is $232. 7M and continues to grow. 

There are several contingent liabilities that may impact the financial stability of the City, 
including the possible need to subsidize Brownfield Redevelopment Bonds of $14. 2M. 

A 1996 levy to pay a general obligation bond expires in 2015, potentially resulting in a 
$6.2M drain per year on the General Fund during FY 2016 and FY 2017. 

City of Wayne 

Recent Developments 



Page 10 


Citizens renewed a 1 mill levy for police and fire on November 4, 2014. The City of 
Westland has officially ended discussions to form a fire authority between the Cities of 
Westland, Wayne, and Inkster. Executive- level instability in the City of Wayne was 
stated as the primary reason for this decision. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

- Projected General Fund deficits for FY 2014 and beyond. 

The City is discussing a May 2015 ballot proposal that would seek voter approval for 
additional millage. 

The positions of Finance Director, Personnel Director, Chief of Police, and Parks and 
Recreation Director are currently vacant. 

David Murphy was appointed Interim City Manager on October 7, 2014. 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

Treasury staff met with the County Executive Transition Team to have a general 
discussion regarding what the team sees as critical issues. 

The Finance Director has indicated that short-term borrowing may not be necessary for 
FY 2015. However, the most recent cash flow statement does not support this 
conclusion. 

- Cash reserves reached its lowest point in August 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $73M (average balance is $170M). This includes proceeds from a short 
term borrowing of $75M. 

- In a monthly status letter from the Director of Labor Relations, the Director continues to 
indicate that negotiations with all bargaining units have stalled. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Warren Evans was elected as Wayne County Executive on November 4, 2014. Mr. Evans 
replaces Robert Ficano. 

The Finance Director anticipates the accumulated deficit for FY 2014, will be 
approximately $60M. The reduction from $159M is mainly due to the transfer of funds 
from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to the General Fund. 

The preliminary results of the County’s actuarial report indicate a drop in OPEB liability 
of approximately $409M. This reduction is a result of the City choosing less expensive 
plans and implementing cost sharing. The participants are paying a larger share of the 
cost. This does not include any savings opportunity resulting from a proposed change to 
retiree healthcare. 

The County is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The County currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The County submitted a revised Deficit Elimination Plan (DEP), approved by the County 
Commission, which removes the changes to retiree healthcare. The loss of the $9.2M in 
savings will be offset by the $10M anticipated increase in revenue sharing. The County 
Treasurer agreed to transfer $150M from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to the 
General Fund. Of that $150M, $82M has already been transferred and applied to the 
accumulated deficit, and $44M has been applied to the operating/structural deficit in 



Page 11 


accordance with the DEP. The additional $24M, which was not part of the DEP, will be 
used to help reduce the accumulated deficit. 

Approval of the County’s DEP is on hold until the new Wayne County Executive takes 
office. The County will be required to submit an updated DEP to include the unaudited 
numbers for FY 2014.

SUBJECT: Status of Financially Stressed Local Governments 

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Flint 

Emergency Manager: Gerald Ambrose 
Appointed: January 13, 2015 
Anticipated Exit : April 2015 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the city’s water system 
through improved waste management, leak detection, and pipe assessments. 

- An EM Order is being prepared that will restructure its SRF loans. This would free up 
approximately $2.2M allowing the city to further improve its water system. 

- The City of Flint had informed residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of 
February are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe 
water. However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all 
testing sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant 
by the MDEQ. Monthly testing will be ongoing, and is being conducted by several 
parties. 

The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements, and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. On March 19, 2015, the report was presented to 
the Flint Water Advisory Committee, but the presentation broke down due to citizen 
unrest. An International City/County Management Association (ICMA) comprehensive 
public safety study has been completed, and was presented to the City Council on 
January 22, 2015. Several recommendations for both police and fire are currently being 
reviewed. Of the 16 major recommendations for public safety, the following four are 
most crucial: 

o Establish more aggressive protocols for responding to service demands from the 
public.

o Equip a minimum of one marked patrol car with an automated external 
defibrillator (AED) and an automatic license plate reader, and equip every car 
with e-ticket readers and printers, 
o Develop a robust in-service training program. 

o Establish and publish a clear multi-year strategic plan that includes specific 
performance goals and objectives for all units. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund accumulated deficit for FY 2014 was $9M. In FY 2013, the General 
Fund had an accumulated deficit of $12. 9M. Noted reductions included $5.6M from 
Parks & Recreation, 2.6M from Community Development, 1.8M from Public Safety, and 
$1.7 from Building Inspections. 

If the city loses the lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the budget does not assume this 
potential additional $5M to $6M expense, which will grow at a rate equal to the general 
rise in healthcare costs. 

Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $143.5K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety through 
updated technology. 

- A fire union collective bargaining agreement has been approved. The estimated annual 
cost savings is approximately $500K by reducing overtime and paid leave. 

- A Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal has been placed on the May 
2015 ballot. If approved by voters this will raise an additional 6 mills, or $3M, for fire 
and police pension funding and retiree healthcare. 

Poor actuarial advice has lead retiree health care in the city to be underfunded. EM 
Coulter has proposed changing retiree contracts to replace cost of city-provided health 
insurance with a stipend for retirees to purchase their own health coverage. The EM’s 
plan would offer a single retiree roughly $ 150/month, a couple could receive 
$3 50/month, with a family cap set at $425/month. This change would reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1M to 600K annually. 

The EM submitted his proposed changes to City Council in March; and they did not act 
within the statutory deadline. The Treasurer’s approval will be needed before the plan 
can be implemented. It is anticipated that the changes would be implemented in June or 
July of 2015. 

- FY 2014 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K out of a total budget 
of $21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 2013 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Noted areas of increased expenditures within the governmental funds included Public 
Safety by $1.1M, Public Works by $700K, and Culture and Recreation by $600K. 


Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 3 


The police and fire pension plan is 30% funded. The general employee pension plan is 
22% funded. The aforementioned Firefighters and Police Officer Retirement Act ballot 
proposal attempts to address the pension funding shortfall. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Police collective bargaining agreements must be finalized. 

Increase and stabilize pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) funding 
levels. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Kevin Clinton, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The City of Detroit held its first statutorily-required Revenue Estimating Conference on 
February 20, 2015. The conference principals, Jay Wortley of Treasury, John Hill of the 
City of Detroit, and George Fulton of the University of Michigan, approved the 
consensus revenues as presented. The principals agreed that the revenue estimates were 
conservative. 

- At the FRC’s February 23, 2015 meeting, the FRC approved, and referred to the newly 
formed Finance and Enterprise Resource subcommittee for further review, the city’s 
revenue estimates that were presented at the aforementioned Revenue Estimating 
Conference. The city will be incorporating the revenue estimates into its Four-Year 
Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) that will be presented to the FRC at its March 23, 
2015 meeting for the Commission’s review. The FRC also approved the city’s debt 
service requirements report and several operational contracts. 

Treasury hired Ron Rose as the Executive Director (ED) for the Office of the FRC within 
the Department. His start date was March 2, 2015. Treasury is in the process of filling 
other key staff positions and has engaged the financial consulting services of UHY. 
Treasury has also engaged Martha Kopacz from Phoenix Management Services. Ms. 
Kopacz and her team acted as independent financial experts for Judge Rhodes in the 
city’s Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings. Among other duties, the consultants will 
provide assistance in reviewing and analyzing the Plan for the FRC. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city will be submitting its Four-Year Financial and Operating Plan to the FRC on 
March 23, 2015 for review, with FRC action expected on April 20, 2015. The city’s Plan 
will encompass the second year (FY16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget 
and use this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY17, FY18, and FY19). 

- Ensuring that the Plan is based on sound assumptions and that the city’s operational 
budgets and actual spending conform to the Plan will be one of the FRC’s most 
significant tasks.

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $622K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a property reappraisal 
which will provide updated and accurate assessing records, upgrade City Hall security, 
and enhance public safety through improved street lighting. 

The Police Chief resigned on March 11, 2015. Lieutenant Ann Moise was appointed 
Acting Police Chief. 

Deputy City Manager/Treasurer John Gabor start date was February 2, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A complaint was filed in the federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to 
healthcare benefits in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently 
unknown, but the city is confident that the benefits in question were improperly offered 
and were rightfully terminated. 

- The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 2015 to $4.3M 
in FY 2019. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. These increases were included in Emergency Manager Square’s two- 
year budget. 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The City Council voted on January 27, 2015 to suspend City Administrator Karen Folks. 
This vote was taken despite two Emergency Manager Orders that prohibit termination 
until October 2015 and establish a process for termination. The City Administrator and 
City Council negotiated a separation agreement which was approved by the RTAB on 
March 12, 2015. The RTAB also approved the City Council’s appointment of the Finance 
Director as Interim City Administrator. A search firm will be hired to begin the process 
of selecting a new City Administrator. 

The city was expecting to issue a bond tender offer beginning in March to reduce 
outstanding debt. However, the tender offer has been delayed due to the uncertainty 
between the City Council and City Administrator. A timeline to complete the bond 
tender process will be developed by the various parties in late March 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 5 


- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the Emergency Manager’s authority to reduce 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is 
pending. No date has been set to hear this motion. 

- City ELall will be relocating to a temporary facility in May 2015. The present facility is in 
poor condition. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Ehmt 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $91 OK through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the water system through 
water main replacements and fire hydrant repairs, and to complete a property reappraisal 
which will provide updated and accurate assessing records. Additionally, the city will 
provide community enhancement through blight management and sidewalk replacement. 
On February 2, 2015, the City Commission unanimously approved a one-year contract 
extension for City Manager Darwin Watson. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On January 20, 2015, the City Commission passed a resolution adopting a fund balance 
policy consistent with Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) Best Practices. 
The RTAB approved the resolution on January 28, 2015. 

- FY 2014 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total 
budget of $6.1 M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $350K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety through 
improved street lighting. 

The city signed a contract with UHY to provide part-time financial services until a 
permanent solution can be found. The RTAB approved the contract on January 13, 2015. 
The City Council cancelled the contracted City Administrator search with the Michigan 
Municipal League (MML) and appointed Wayne O’Neal as full-time City Administrator. 
On February 10, 2015, the RTAB approved the City’s resolution appointing Mr. O’Neal. 
The city continues to have trouble attracting qualified candidates, and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The RTAB’s Annual Evaluation for the Governor was not favorable, citing a lack of local 
financial literacy, political infighting, and an inability to develop a balanced multi-year 
budget. For these reasons, the Board did not recommend removal of RTAB oversight at 
this time. 



Page 6 


- Municipal Employee's Retiree System (MERS) pension contributions are anticipated to 
increase from $1.8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 2016 because of accelerated funding for 
closed plans. 

The city has been unable to balance their five-year budget. Previous budgets project 
deficit spending in FY 2016, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 2017. To avoid this 
eventuality, significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 
Flowever, an action plan to reduce expenses is not forthcoming from the city. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $125K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used for community enhancement 
through blight management. 

In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. A suitable candidate was not found through a Michigan Municipal 
League (MML) search. A new search firm has been hired to recruit a Deputy Mayor as 
part of the transition back to Home Rule. 

Per the audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance for FY 2014 is 
approximately $5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

- The City Charter Revision Commission submitted a proposed Charter by the February 
10, 2015 deadline and the proposed Charter will be on the May 2015 ballot. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- The General Fund is structurally balanced in FY 2015 but expenditures are projected to 
exceed revenues by $360K due to deferred projects from FY 2014. 

- Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the city’s condemnation 
lawsuit involving the Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for 
the lien placed on the property. The city is preparing an appeal of the decision to the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge 
Avern Cohn. The lawsuit challenges former Emergency Manager Schimmel’ s 
elimination of retiree healthcare and replacement with an annual stipend. The General 
Employees Retirement System (GERS) Pension Fund is significantly overfunded and the 
parties are exploring options to use the overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. 

On March f 7, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial a previous 
lower court dismissal of a previous 2013 suit which challenged the EM ordered 
nonpayment of $3.9 million into a VEBA trust for the fiscal year ending 2012. This 
appellate order is not a judgment against the city, rather it allows the previously 
dismissed lawsuit to proceed. The actual liability of the city will be determined either by 
a future settlement or by a final determination of the Oakland County Circuit Court. 

The GERS Board proposal was submitted to the court on January 30, 2015. 


CONSENT AGREEMENT 



Page 7 


Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $855K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a property reappraisal to 
provide updated and accurate assessing records, enhance the water system through fire 
hydrant repairs, and enhancing public safety through the creation of a multi-jurisdictional 
narcotics team, police officer training, deployment of an additional police officer, 
providing a backup power source, and updating technology. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The FY 2014 General Fund accumulated deficit is $767K out of a total budget of $1 1M. 

River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $592K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety through 
improved street lighting, along with infrastructure replacements to City Hall. 

Deborah Hayes-Price has been promoted to Chief of Police to replace former Police 
Chief Jeffrey Harris who retired in January. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- U.S. Steel annual $1M tax settlement payment to the city has expired. 

General Fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 2014 and the 
accumulated fund balance was $1.9M. 

A reduction in healthcare benefits for active employees and retirees was implemented on 
November 1, 2014. The city estimates an annual savings of $400K. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The township was awarded $274K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, 
and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety 
through improved street lighting and increased police services. 

The State Treasurer rejected a decision by the Township Board to extend the contract 
with the current township attorney at a cost that was twice the amount of the lowest 
bidder. The Consent Agreement Consultant, Robert Burgess, issued an order requiring 
the township to extend a contract for legal services to the lowest bidder, Giarmarco, 
Mullins & Horton, P.C. This is one example of the difficulty the Consent Agreement 



Page 8 


Consultant has encountered in his efforts to have the Supervisor and Township Board 
comply with provisions of the Consent Agreement. 

The State Treasurer approved an amendment to the Fire Services Contract with the City 
of Ferndale on March 11, 2015. This amendment is projected to reduce annual costs to 
the township by $4K thru the end of 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township. The 
Department of Treasury and the Michigan State Police continue to work with the 
township and are reviewing a proposal from the City of Hazel Park to provide police 
services to the township. 

The State Treasurer approved the township’s 2015 budget on December 16, 2014, with 
the requirement that the township work with Treasury to implement additional budget 
amendments to improve its overall effectiveness. No additional actions have occurred to 
implement these additional budget amendments as the township was without the services 
of a financial consultant from the time of budget adoption through March 1, 2015. 

The township currently has an aging accounts payable in excess of $200K. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
PA 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the city’s water system 
through meter replacement, leak detection, and system repairs. 

- Cathy Square, former Hamtramck Emergency Manager, was hired to fill the position of 
City Administrator. 

Huron Consulting has been hired to prepare a request for proposal (RFP) to solicit firms 
to operate and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan 
of Adjustment. The proposals are due on April 20, 2015. 

BenStaff has been hired by the city to make recommendations that will reduce healthcare 
costs. 

The law firm of Lewis & Munday has been hired to assist the city with the restructuring 
of the other post-employment benefits (OPEB). 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city selected Tetra-Tech to prepare a water and sewer rate study. A draft study was 
completed on February 20, 2015. This study provides the city with proposed rates, which 
if adopted, will provide adequate revenue to operate and maintain the water and sewer 
system. 

The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20. 7M owed to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), 
$17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits (OPEB) 
liabilities. 



Page 9 


Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014. 

o Fifth Third Bank has finalized an agreement and settled for 50 cents on the dollar 
for outstanding debt. 

o By June 30, 2015, Highland Park, as required by terms of the emergency loan, 
must have a third-party operator for its water/sewer systems. 

o After the selection of this third-party operator, DWSD and Highland Park will 
negotiate a long-term settlement for outstanding water and sewer debt. 

o The city must reduce retiree healthcare benefit costs. 

o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $16.4M, which includes the restructuring 
of $4.8M in existing loans, will be used to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization 
Bonds, $5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund 
Bonds. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 
Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

In December 2014, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of retirees 
who receive a 13 th check to offset inflation. The county is required to return $32M to the 
Pension Equity Fund. 

- A Financial and Operating Plan and a voluntary Consent Agreement are being drafted. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Cash reserves reached its lowest point in August 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $73M. The average balance is $170M. This number includes proceeds 
from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

- A letter to the Treasurer from previous County Executive Robert Ficano, indicates that 
with the significant transfer of revenue from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund 
(DTRF), the General Fund deficit will be reduced to approximately $50M for FY 2014. 

In the same letter, it is indicated that the County has budgeted a transfer of $64M from 
the DTRF to balance the General Fund in FY 2015. However, this represents the last of 
the DTRF’s unrestricted equity. This will result in a potential budget gap of $20M in FY 
2016. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures. The Plan participants are now paying a larger share of the cost. This does not 
include any saving opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 
The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

- After conducting preliminary interviews for the City Administrator position, a request 
was made by the Emergency Manager to identify additional qualified candidates. 

A fire union collective bargaining agreement was approved on February 6, 2015. 
Changes to overtime and paid leave will yield an estimated cost savings of $500K 
annually. 

- Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal that was on 
the May ballot by a margin of 47% to 53%. Had it been approved it would have raised an 
additional 6 mils, or $3M annually to fund fire and police pension and healthcare costs. 

- EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes will be implemented on July 1, 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1M to $600K annually. 

- FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. Salient 
increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $143. 5K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through updated technology. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Police collective bargaining agreements must be finalized.

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city submitted its Four-Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March 2015 for review. Upon its review and determination that the Plan was based on 
sound assumptions and met all of the requirements under statute, the FRC approved the 
Plan on April 20, 2015. The city’s Plan encompassed the second year (FY16) of 
Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used this as its base year with no 
changes, plus three years (FY17, FY18, and FY19). 

The city’s CFO John Hill hosted a “mini” revenue estimating conference on May 14, 
2015, to review revenue estimates approved in February 2015 at the statutorily required 
Revenue Estimating Conference. After reviewing the city’s revenue trends for income 
tax, state revenue sharing, wagering taxes, property taxes, utility users tax and all other 
general fund revenues, among other major fund accounts, and discussing economic trends 
since February, the city elected to maintain revenue estimates agreed upon at the 
February 2015 Revenue Estimating Conference. 

In addition to the recent hire of Ron Rose for the position of Executive Director for the 
Office of the FRC, Treasury has hired Steven Watson, who is currently with the State of 
New Jersey Office of Budget and Management, to fill the Administrative Manager 
position. Mr. Watson is expected to start on May 26, 2015. Treasury does not expect to 
hire any additional staff beyond an executive administrative assistant. 

The most intense work that the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restructuring initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

- The next FRC meeting is scheduled for May 18, 2015, and the Commission will be asked 
to approve various contracts and leases related to the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department transaction. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The RTAB approved City Council’s appointment of the city’s Finance Director as 
Interim City Administrator, effective March 12, 2015. A professional search firm has 
been hired to help find City Administrator candidates. Treasury will be participating with 
City Council in the selection process. 

The city was expecting to issue a bond tender offer beginning in March but was delayed 
due to the uncertainty around the City Administrator position. Completion of the bond 
tender process is now projected to be June 2015. 

In April, the RTAB approved the creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator 
position to assist in overseeing city operations until the bond tender and City Hall 



Page 3 


projects are completed. Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, 
was appointed to this position. 

The Michigan Municipal League and Plante Moran were retained by the city to conduct 
salary and classification studies of all department head and key manager positions within 
the city. The city has not established a timeline for this project at this time. 

The city remains without a Director of Public Services after the leading candidate for the 
position rejected the city’s offer of employment. A department foreman is serving as 
interim while the city evaluates how to fill this position. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

- City Hall will be relocating to a temporary facility in May 2015. The present facility is in 
poor condition and beyond repair. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 

Recent Developments 

- The city’s Finance Director has accepted a position as Finance Director in the City of 
Flint. Her last date of employment is June 5, 2015. 

- The city’s Deputy Finance Director, multiple public safety officers, and two public works 
department employees have resigned due to other employment opportunities. 

- On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $910K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
water system through water main replacements and fire hydrant repairs, and to complete 
a property reappraisal which will provide updated and accurate assessing records. 
Additionally, the city will provide community enhancement through blight management 
and sidewalk replacement. 

- FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. 

The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months) 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. 



Page 4 


The RTAB has recommended that the State Treasurer amend the final EM order to 
provide RTAB oversight for all hiring and terminations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $350K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through improved street lighting. 

The City Council cancelled the contracted City Administrator search with the Michigan 
Municipal League (MML) and appointed Wayne O’Neal as full-time City Administrator. 
On February 10, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s resolution appointing Mr. O’Neal. 
The RTAB’s Annual Evaluation for the Governor was not favorable, citing a lack of local 
financial literacy, political infighting, and an inability to develop a balanced multi-year 
budget. For these reasons, the removal of RTAB oversight cannot be recommended at 
this time. 

The city continues to have trouble attracting qualified candidates, and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

The city signed a contract with UHY to provide part-time financial services until a 
permanent solution can be found. 

- Municipal Employee's Retiree System (MERS) pension contributions are anticipated to 
increase from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 because of accelerated funding for 
closed plans. 

- The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Fleaden, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

A clerical error by the Flint City Clerk’s Office gave candidates the wrong cutoff 
deadline to file nominating petitions, April 28 instead of April 21. Consequently, in the 
Mayor’s race, Mayor Dayne Walling, Councilman Wantwaz Davis, and Dr. Karen 
Weaver will all be left off the August Primary ballot and will have to run as write-in 
candidates in November. Councilman Eric Mays did not submit the required number of 
signatures and will likewise be left off the ballot for Mayor and will also have to run as a 
write-in candidate. Councilman Herbert Winfrey will be on the ballot and is unopposed 
for the Sixth Ward seat on the City Council. There were four candidates who filed 
petitions for the Third Ward City Council seat. Legislators will be asked to provide a 
statutory fix to allow names on the ballot. If this isn’t successful, all will be forced to run 
as write-in candidates in the General Election. 

Jodi Lundquist has accepted the employment offer as CFO. Her start date is to be 
determined subject to RTAB approval. 

On April 29, 2015 the city exited emergency manager status and an RTAB was 
appointed. The first RTAB meeting will be held on June 10, 2015. 

On April 29, 2015, the Emergency Loan Financial Assistance Board approved a $7M 
Emergency Loan that will eliminate the city’s remaining deficit when combined with the 
FY surplus of $20M. 



Page 5 


- EM Gerry Ambrose issued an EM Order on March 19, 2015 that restructured the State 
Revolving Fund loans and provides approximately $2.2M, allowing the city to invest in 
capital improvements to the water system. 

- EM Gerry Ambrose implemented new Budget Purchasing Ordinances and a Fund 
Balance Policy during April 2015. 

The Executive Director of the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with state statute, State Tax 
Commission rules, and implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the city 
shall implement a full appraisal within a time frame agreed with the State Tax 
Commission. 

The City of Flint continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of March 
are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe water. 
However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all testing 
sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant by the 
MDEQ. Monthly testing remains ongoing and is being conducted by several parties. 

The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M granulated active- 
charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be completed in mid- 
July. 

In April, EM Gerry Ambrose issued two EM Orders that adopted a two-year budget for 
FY 17 and FY 18 and outlined the relationship between the Administrator, Mayor, and 
City Council. 

- On April 13, 2015, EM Order 4 was issued that restored the pay of the Mayor and City 
Council members. 

- The City Council approved a memorandum of understanding that will consolidate the 
67 th District Court with the 68th District Court in January 2016. The city has estimated 
that the consolidation will save the city $8M over a ten year period. 

The Michigan Municipal League is recruiting qualified candidates to fill the open Human 
Relations Director, Finance Director, and City Treasurer positions. 

Voters elected John Cherry, Charles Metcalf, Barry Williams, Cleora Magee, Jim 
Richardson, Brian Larkin, Victoria McKenze, Marsha Wesley, and Heidi Phaneuf to 
serve on the Charter Commission. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
city’s water system through improved waste management, leak detection, and pipe 
assessments. Pre-planning for implementation of these activities is underway. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume this additional $5M to $6M annual expense, which will grow at a rate equal to the 
general rise in healthcare costs. 


Hamtramck 



Page 6 


RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The Police Chief resigned on March 11, 2015. Lieutenant Ann Moise was appointed 
Acting Police Chief. 

Per the 2014 audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance is $2.8M out of a total 
budget of $16.2M. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $622K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a 
property reappraisal which will provide updated and accurate assessing records, upgrade 
City Hall security, and enhance public safety through improved street lighting. 

A complaint was filed in the federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to 
healthcare benefits in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently 
unknown. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M in 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. These increases were included in EM Square’s two-year budget. The 
Segal Group has been hired to provide the city with recommendations on funding its 
pension obligations. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

- On April 22, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. This ordinance amendment was adopted by the City Council at its April 9, 
2015 meeting with no prior announcement or analysis of the issue. No actuarial study 
was conducted for this change, but the best available estimates indicated the impact to the 
city’s pension system could be approximately $9M-$13M per year. The Mayor, City 
Administrator, and Finance Director are opposed to this amendment. 

On April 29, 2015, the City Administrator informed Treasury that the City Council is 
considering adopting an amendment to the city’s retirement ordinance that would permit 
the pension system to absorb $659,000 in COLA overpayments that were made to city 
retirees. Such an action is permissible under new rules adopted by the Internal Revenue 
Service. The City Council may consider this ordinance amendment at a future Council 
meeting. The RTAB postponed action on this issue until City Council takes action. 
Treasury is monitoring this situation. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $125K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used for community 
enhancement through blight management. 



Page 7 


The City Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 45% to 55% margin. 

In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. A suitable candidate was not found through a Michigan Municipal 
League (MML) search. TJA Staffing and Associates has been hired to recruit a Deputy 
Mayor as part of the transition back to Flome Rule. 

Per the audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance for FY 14 is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the city’s condemnation 
lawsuit involving the Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for 
the lien placed on the property. The city is preparing an appeal of the decision to the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge 
Avern Cohn. The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree 
healthcare and replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement 
System (GERS) Pension Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring 
options to use the overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. 

On March 17, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial a 
previous lower court dismissal of a 2013 lawsuit which challenged the EM ordered 
nonpayment of $3.9M into a VEBA trust for the fiscal year ending 2012. This appellate 
order is not a judgment against the city; rather it allows the previously dismissed lawsuit 
to proceed. The actual liability of the city will be determined either by a future settlement 
or by a final determination of the Oakland County Circuit Court. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement will be placed on the tax roll by a 
judgement levy. 

On April 20, 2015, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault 
and mistreatment of a prisoner (Richard Dent) against William Melendez, former Inkster 
police officer. 

In the wake of a violent interaction between Inkster police and a suspect, Inkster Police 
Chief Vicki Yost announced her resignation on April 22, 2015. The city hired a search 
firm to recruit qualified candidates to fill the Police Chief position, which is expected to 
be filled by the end of June. 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $855K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a 
property reappraisal to provide updated and accurate assessing records, enhance the water 



Page 8 


system through fire hydrant repairs, and enhancing public safety through the creation of a 
multi-jurisdictional narcotics team, police officer training, deployment of an additional 
police officer, providing a backup power source, and updating technology. 

The FY 14 General Fund accumulated deficit per the most recent audit is $767K out of a 
total budget of $ 1 1M. 


River Rouee 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

A fire union collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was approved on March 10, 2015, 
resulting in a reduction in health care costs. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $592K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through improved street lighting, along with infrastructure replacements to 
City Hall. 

- General fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 14 and the accumulated 
fund balance was $1.9M. 

- A reduction in healthcare benefits for active employees and retirees was implemented on 
November 1, 2014. The city estimates an annual savings of $400K, which includes 
savings expected under the approved fire union CBA. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that the Township Supervisor is regularly approving 
overtime for employees. Overtime is not included in the 2015 budget, and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to any overtime expenditures. This is 
another example of the township’s inability to comply with the terms of the Consent 
Agreement. Treasury is working with Robert Burgess on a response to this development. 
On April 7, 2015, Oakland County notified the township that they rejected the proposed 
ballot language for 414 mils for general operations because the township’s proposed 
language did not conform to guidelines. The township adopted newly proposed ballot 
language on April 23, 2015. This language has been resubmitted to Oakland County. 

An Order was issued by Mr. Burgess on May 9, 2015 to contract for financial consulting 
services with the Rehmann Group that will assist the township in preparing records for its 
annual audit and budget amendments. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the township was awarded $274K through the Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to 



Page 9 


enhance public safety through improved street lighting and increased police services. 195 
street lights would be converted to LEDs; it is anticipated that work will be completed by 
August 2015. 

The Michigan State Police (MSP) continues to provide police services to the township. 
The Department of Treasury and the MSP continue to work towards an alternative to 
MSP services. A proposal from the City of Hazel Park is not financially feasible due to 
expense and the city’s unwillingness to amend the proposal to better accommodate the 
township’s ability to pay. Mr. Burgess has met with the City of Detroit to determine if 
the city is interested in submitting a proposal to provide police services to the township. 
The State Treasurer approved the township’s 2015 budget on December 16, 2014, with 
the requirement that the township work with Treasury to implement additional budget 
amendments to improve its overall effectiveness. No additional actions have occurred to 
implement these additional budget amendments and Mr. Burgess is questioning the 
ability of the township’s newly hired financial analyst to provide service to the township. 
The township has paid its aging accounts payable that was in excess of $200K. Mr. 
Burgess has requested the Township Board adopt budget amendments to the 2015 budget 
totaling $220K to accommodate these unanticipated expenditures. The Township Board 
has refused to adopt the requested amendments. Treasury is working with the CAC 
Burgess on a response to this issue. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
PA 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

- Treasury staff is continuing to monitor the city’s progress or lack thereof, in complying 
with the terms of the Loan Agreement dated September 23, 2014. There are concerns 
about their ability to successfully restructure their finances and they have failed to 
implement the health insurance benefit cost reductions as planned in FY 15. In addition, 
failure to reach an agreement with DWSD resulted in a $20M judgement levy against the 
city. Finally, there have been problems in implementing the regular billing of water and 
sewer service to its customers and the calculation and collection of past due amounts 
owed to the city, since regular billing ceased in mid-2012. 

On April 24, 2015, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) was granted a 
judgment levy to collect $20M for sewer service that is currently owed to DWSD. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. 

A Wayne County Circuit Judge issued a temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 
blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water service to the City of Highland Park. In 
addition, the judge also set aside the $20M judgment against the City of Highland Park 
for failure to pay DWSD for water and sewer services. The judge has set a conference 
hearing on this matter for June 4, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 10 


On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
city’s water system through meter replacement, leak detection, and system repairs. 

Fluron Consulting was retained to prepare a request for proposal to solicit firms to operate 
and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan of 
Adjustment. The city received one proposal from Wade Trim by the submission deadline 
of May 4, 2015. This proposal is under review by the City and Treasury. 

The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20. 7M owed to the DWSD, $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. 

Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014: 

o The city must make major reductions to retiree healthcare benefit costs, 
o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $12M plus restructuring of $4.8M existing 
loans will be requested by the city to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization Bonds, 
$5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund Bonds. 
The status of this request will be reviewed in the context of benchmarks the city 
committed to in their last emergency loan in September 2014. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Wayne County 


Recent Developments 

The Recovery Plan has been released to the public and Treasury has begun an analysis of 
the plan. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Cash reserves reached its lowest point in February 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $22M. The August 2014 cash balance was approximately $150M. This 
number includes proceeds from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

The County’s annual structural general fund deficit is approximately $50M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures. The Plan participants are now paying a larger share of the cost. This does not 
include any saving opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 
The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

The Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor, State of Michigan 
P.O.Box 30013 
Lansing, Ml 48909 

RE: Call for Additional Support for Flint Water Improvement Plan 
Dear Governor Snyder: 

On behalf of the Flint community, I am writing with a renewed request for additional support to 
address Flint’s water challenges to ensure that water is affordable and secure for everyone in Flint 
especially our vulnerable populations. I am asking for an additional $30 million in funds for Flint’s 
infrastructure and a new healthy homes initiative. 

Significant progress has been made throughout this year to increase water safety and quality and I 
thank you for the involvement of your office, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 
and the Michigan Department of Treasury. A majority of items in the Water Improvement Plan 
are completed or underway. Most importantly, Flint is now in compliance with the Safe Drinking 
Water Act due in large part to the installation of the new carbon filter. The infrastructure systems 
are being made more secure and efficient through the State grants. Now the City is committed to 
following the recommendation of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to optimize 
the treatment process, reduce corrosion and further minimize risks from lead. 

The need to accelerate the City’s capital improvement investments remains and has been further 
increased by the continued financial stress and legal issues. Previously I requested support for 
replacement or forgiveness of payment to the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund due to Flint’s 
status as a distressed community and the gap in funding in the adopted capital improvement plan. 
I understand that the existing federal law does not allow the existing Drinking Water Revolving 
Loans that Flint is carrying to be forgiven in retrospect but the need still exists. Flint owes 
approximately $20 Million. One solution is for the State to grant a new $20 Million that is designed 
as forgivable from the start. Another solution is to provide

equivalent funding through an expansion of the grant program to Michigan’s Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships with a supplemental budget amendment in cooperation 
with the State Legislature. 

The community’s heightened concern about lead leeching into the water from old service lines and 
home plumbing also needs to be addressed. We know that lead is an environmental contaminant 
and there have been many programs in place over the years to address sources in paint and pipes. 
Flint needs a new healthy homes initiative specifically focused on lead in water with $10 Million 
to start the process of replacing service lines for the most vulnerable households. Regardless of the 
source and treatment of Flint’s water, this long term threat of lead in pipes needs to be removed in 
the interest of public health. 

My approach continues to be to work with you and your appointed officials. State Senator Ananich, 
State Representatives Phelps and Neeley, Congressman Kildee, community groups, businesses, 
churches, foundations, the Flint City Council, and all of the City of Flint and State and Federal 
government personnel. We need every available expert and resource to address Flint’s water 
problems. 

Flint’s safety is my top priority. Just as the City and State have worked together on public safety, 
we need additional support for fixing the water problems. We need $30 Million in new funds to 
repair and update the city-wide infrastructure and to assist households in becoming lead-free. The 
entire Flint community deserves sustainable, safe, secure and affordable water now and into the 
future. Thank you for the consideration Governor and I look forward to future discussions. 



Mayor, City of Flint

from the Governor’s Office will be in it. 1 know Dick is calling in from Grand Rapids and I’m pretty sure that Dennis 
won’t be in the office for the first half, if not the entire call. So they may be coming over here to sit in a conference room

Harvey is working on more info. Issue is that Gov's office was happy w/ Flint staying with Detroit

SUBJECT: Status of Financially Stressed Local Governments 


EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

- After conducting preliminary interviews for the City Administrator position, a request 
was made by the Emergency Manager to identify additional qualified candidates. 

A fire union collective bargaining agreement was approved on February 6, 2015. 
Changes to overtime and paid leave will yield an estimated cost savings of $500K 
annually. 

- Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal that was on 
the May ballot by a margin of 47% to 53%. Had it been approved it would have raised an 
additional 6 mils, or $3M annually to fund fire and police pension and healthcare costs. 

- EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes will be implemented on July 1, 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1M to $600K annually. 

- FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. Salient 
increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K.

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city submitted its Four-Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March 2015 for review. Upon its review and determination that the Plan was based on 
sound assumptions and met all of the requirements under statute, the FRC approved the 
Plan on April 20, 2015. The city’s Plan encompassed the second year (FY16) of 
Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used this as its base year with no 
changes, plus three years (FY17, FY18, and FY19). 

The city’s CFO John Hill hosted a “mini” revenue estimating conference on May 14, 
2015, to review revenue estimates approved in February 2015 at the statutorily required 
Revenue Estimating Conference. After reviewing the city’s revenue trends for income 
tax, state revenue sharing, wagering taxes, property taxes, utility users tax and all other 
general fund revenues, among other major fund accounts, and discussing economic trends 
since February, the city elected to maintain revenue estimates agreed upon at the 
February 2015 Revenue Estimating Conference. 

In addition to the recent hire of Ron Rose for the position of Executive Director for the 
Office of the FRC, Treasury has hired Steven Watson, who is currently with the State of 
New Jersey Office of Budget and Management, to fill the Administrative Manager 
position. Mr. Watson is expected to start on May 26, 2015. Treasury does not expect to 
hire any additional staff beyond an executive administrative assistant. 

The most intense work that the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restructuring initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

- The next FRC meeting is scheduled for May 18, 2015, and the Commission will be asked 
to approve various contracts and leases related to the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department transaction. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The RTAB approved City Council’s appointment of the city’s Finance Director as 
Interim City Administrator, effective March 12, 2015. A professional search firm has 
been hired to help find City Administrator candidates. Treasury will be participating with 
City Council in the selection process. 

The city was expecting to issue a bond tender offer beginning in March but was delayed 
due to the uncertainty around the City Administrator position. Completion of the bond 
tender process is now projected to be June 2015. 

In April, the RTAB approved the creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator 
position to assist in overseeing city operations until the bond tender and City Hall 



Page 3 


projects are completed. Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, 
was appointed to this position. 

The Michigan Municipal League and Plante Moran were retained by the city to conduct 
salary and classification studies of all department head and key manager positions within 
the city. The city has not established a timeline for this project at this time. 

The city remains without a Director of Public Services after the leading candidate for the 
position rejected the city’s offer of employment. A department foreman is serving as 
interim while the city evaluates how to fill this position. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

- City Hall will be relocating to a temporary facility in May 2015. The present facility is in 
poor condition and beyond repair. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 

Recent Developments 

- The city’s Finance Director has accepted a position as Finance Director in the City of 
Flint. Her last date of employment is June 5, 2015. 

- The city’s Deputy Finance Director, multiple public safety officers, and two public works 
department employees have resigned due to other employment opportunities. 

- On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $910K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
water system through water main replacements and fire hydrant repairs, and to complete 
a property reappraisal which will provide updated and accurate assessing records. 
Additionally, the city will provide community enhancement through blight management 
and sidewalk replacement. 

- FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. 

The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months) 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. 



Page 4 


The RTAB has recommended that the State Treasurer amend the final EM order to 
provide RTAB oversight for all hiring and terminations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $350K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through improved street lighting. 

The City Council cancelled the contracted City Administrator search with the Michigan 
Municipal League (MML) and appointed Wayne O’Neal as full-time City Administrator. 
On February 10, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s resolution appointing Mr. O’Neal. 
The RTAB’s Annual Evaluation for the Governor was not favorable, citing a lack of local 
financial literacy, political infighting, and an inability to develop a balanced multi-year 
budget. For these reasons, the removal of RTAB oversight cannot be recommended at 
this time. 

The city continues to have trouble attracting qualified candidates, and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

The city signed a contract with UHY to provide part-time financial services until a 
permanent solution can be found. 

- Municipal Employee's Retiree System (MERS) pension contributions are anticipated to 
increase from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 because of accelerated funding for 
closed plans. 

- The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Fleaden, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

A clerical error by the Flint City Clerk’s Office gave candidates the wrong cutoff 
deadline to file nominating petitions, April 28 instead of April 21. Consequently, in the 
Mayor’s race, Mayor Dayne Walling, Councilman Wantwaz Davis, and Dr. Karen 
Weaver will all be left off the August Primary ballot and will have to run as write-in 
candidates in November. Councilman Eric Mays did not submit the required number of 
signatures and will likewise be left off the ballot for Mayor and will also have to run as a 
write-in candidate. Councilman Herbert Winfrey will be on the ballot and is unopposed 
for the Sixth Ward seat on the City Council. There were four candidates who filed 
petitions for the Third Ward City Council seat. Legislators will be asked to provide a 
statutory fix to allow names on the ballot. If this isn’t successful, all will be forced to run 
as write-in candidates in the General Election. 

Jodi Lundquist has accepted the employment offer as CFO. Her start date is to be 
determined subject to RTAB approval. 

On April 29, 2015 the city exited emergency manager status and an RTAB was 
appointed. The first RTAB meeting will be held on June 10, 2015. 

On April 29, 2015, the Emergency Loan Financial Assistance Board approved a $7M 
Emergency Loan that will eliminate the city’s remaining deficit when combined with the 
FY surplus of $20M.

- EM Gerry Ambrose issued an EM Order on March 19, 2015 that restructured the State 
Revolving Fund loans and provides approximately $2.2M, allowing the city to invest in 
capital improvements to the water system. 

- EM Gerry Ambrose implemented new Budget Purchasing Ordinances and a Fund 
Balance Policy during April 2015. 

The Executive Director of the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with state statute, State Tax 
Commission rules, and implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the city 
shall implement a full appraisal within a time frame agreed with the State Tax 
Commission. 

The City of Flint continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of March 
are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe water. 
However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all testing 
sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant by the 
MDEQ. Monthly testing remains ongoing and is being conducted by several parties. 

The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M granulated active- 
charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be completed in mid- 
July. 

In April, EM Gerry Ambrose issued two EM Orders that adopted a two-year budget for 
FY 17 and FY 18 and outlined the relationship between the Administrator, Mayor, and 
City Council. 

- On April 13, 2015, EM Order 4 was issued that restored the pay of the Mayor and City 
Council members. 

- The City Council approved a memorandum of understanding that will consolidate the 
67 th District Court with the 68th District Court in January 2016. The city has estimated 
that the consolidation will save the city $8M over a ten year period. 

The Michigan Municipal League is recruiting qualified candidates to fill the open Human 
Relations Director, Finance Director, and City Treasurer positions. 

Voters elected John Cherry, Charles Metcalf, Barry Williams, Cleora Magee, Jim 
Richardson, Brian Larkin, Victoria McKenze, Marsha Wesley, and Heidi Phaneuf to 
serve on the Charter Commission. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
city’s water system through improved waste management, leak detection, and pipe 
assessments. Pre-planning for implementation of these activities is underway. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume this additional $5M to $6M annual expense, which will grow at a rate equal to the 
general rise in healthcare costs. 


Hamtramck

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The Police Chief resigned on March 11, 2015. Lieutenant Ann Moise was appointed 
Acting Police Chief. 

Per the 2014 audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance is $2.8M out of a total 
budget of $16.2M. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $622K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a 
property reappraisal which will provide updated and accurate assessing records, upgrade 
City Hall security, and enhance public safety through improved street lighting. 

A complaint was filed in the federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to 
healthcare benefits in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently 
unknown. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M in 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. These increases were included in EM Square’s two-year budget. The 
Segal Group has been hired to provide the city with recommendations on funding its 
pension obligations. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

- On April 22, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. This ordinance amendment was adopted by the City Council at its April 9, 
2015 meeting with no prior announcement or analysis of the issue. No actuarial study 
was conducted for this change, but the best available estimates indicated the impact to the 
city’s pension system could be approximately $9M-$13M per year. The Mayor, City 
Administrator, and Finance Director are opposed to this amendment. 

On April 29, 2015, the City Administrator informed Treasury that the City Council is 
considering adopting an amendment to the city’s retirement ordinance that would permit 
the pension system to absorb $659,000 in COLA overpayments that were made to city 
retirees. Such an action is permissible under new rules adopted by the Internal Revenue 
Service. The City Council may consider this ordinance amendment at a future Council 
meeting. The RTAB postponed action on this issue until City Council takes action. 
Treasury is monitoring this situation. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $125K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used for community 
enhancement through blight management.

The City Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 45% to 55% margin. 

In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. A suitable candidate was not found through a Michigan Municipal 
League (MML) search. TJA Staffing and Associates has been hired to recruit a Deputy 
Mayor as part of the transition back to Flome Rule. 

Per the audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance for FY 14 is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the city’s condemnation 
lawsuit involving the Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for 
the lien placed on the property. The city is preparing an appeal of the decision to the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge 
Avern Cohn. The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree 
healthcare and replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement 
System (GERS) Pension Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring 
options to use the overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. 

On March 17, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial a 
previous lower court dismissal of a 2013 lawsuit which challenged the EM ordered 
nonpayment of $3.9M into a VEBA trust for the fiscal year ending 2012. This appellate 
order is not a judgment against the city; rather it allows the previously dismissed lawsuit 
to proceed. The actual liability of the city will be determined either by a future settlement 
or by a final determination of the Oakland County Circuit Court. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement will be placed on the tax roll by a 
judgement levy. 

On April 20, 2015, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault 
and mistreatment of a prisoner (Richard Dent) against William Melendez, former Inkster 
police officer. 

In the wake of a violent interaction between Inkster police and a suspect, Inkster Police 
Chief Vicki Yost announced her resignation on April 22, 2015. The city hired a search 
firm to recruit qualified candidates to fill the Police Chief position, which is expected to 
be filled by the end of June. 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $855K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a 
property reappraisal to provide updated and accurate assessing records, enhance the water

system through fire hydrant repairs, and enhancing public safety through the creation of a 
multi-jurisdictional narcotics team, police officer training, deployment of an additional 
police officer, providing a backup power source, and updating technology. 

The FY 14 General Fund accumulated deficit per the most recent audit is $767K out of a 
total budget of $ 1 1M. 


River Rouee 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

A fire union collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was approved on March 10, 2015, 
resulting in a reduction in health care costs. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $592K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through improved street lighting, along with infrastructure replacements to 
City Hall. 

- General fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 14 and the accumulated 
fund balance was $1.9M. 

- A reduction in healthcare benefits for active employees and retirees was implemented on 
November 1, 2014. The city estimates an annual savings of $400K, which includes 
savings expected under the approved fire union CBA. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that the Township Supervisor is regularly approving 
overtime for employees. Overtime is not included in the 2015 budget, and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to any overtime expenditures. This is 
another example of the township’s inability to comply with the terms of the Consent 
Agreement. Treasury is working with Robert Burgess on a response to this development. 
On April 7, 2015, Oakland County notified the township that they rejected the proposed 
ballot language for 414 mils for general operations because the township’s proposed 
language did not conform to guidelines. The township adopted newly proposed ballot 
language on April 23, 2015. This language has been resubmitted to Oakland County. 

An Order was issued by Mr. Burgess on May 9, 2015 to contract for financial consulting 
services with the Rehmann Group that will assist the township in preparing records for its 
annual audit and budget amendments. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the township was awarded $274K through the Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to 



Page 9 


enhance public safety through improved street lighting and increased police services. 195 
street lights would be converted to LEDs; it is anticipated that work will be completed by 
August 2015. 

The Michigan State Police (MSP) continues to provide police services to the township. 
The Department of Treasury and the MSP continue to work towards an alternative to 
MSP services. A proposal from the City of Hazel Park is not financially feasible due to 
expense and the city’s unwillingness to amend the proposal to better accommodate the 
township’s ability to pay. Mr. Burgess has met with the City of Detroit to determine if 
the city is interested in submitting a proposal to provide police services to the township. 
The State Treasurer approved the township’s 2015 budget on December 16, 2014, with 
the requirement that the township work with Treasury to implement additional budget 
amendments to improve its overall effectiveness. No additional actions have occurred to 
implement these additional budget amendments and Mr. Burgess is questioning the 
ability of the township’s newly hired financial analyst to provide service to the township. 
The township has paid its aging accounts payable that was in excess of $200K. Mr. 
Burgess has requested the Township Board adopt budget amendments to the 2015 budget 
totaling $220K to accommodate these unanticipated expenditures. The Township Board 
has refused to adopt the requested amendments. Treasury is working with the CAC 
Burgess on a response to this issue. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
PA 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

- Treasury staff is continuing to monitor the city’s progress or lack thereof, in complying 
with the terms of the Loan Agreement dated September 23, 2014. There are concerns 
about their ability to successfully restructure their finances and they have failed to 
implement the health insurance benefit cost reductions as planned in FY 15. In addition, 
failure to reach an agreement with DWSD resulted in a $20M judgement levy against the 
city. Finally, there have been problems in implementing the regular billing of water and 
sewer service to its customers and the calculation and collection of past due amounts 
owed to the city, since regular billing ceased in mid-2012. 

On April 24, 2015, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) was granted a 
judgment levy to collect $20M for sewer service that is currently owed to DWSD. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. 

A Wayne County Circuit Judge issued a temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 
blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water service to the City of Highland Park. In 
addition, the judge also set aside the $20M judgment against the City of Highland Park 
for failure to pay DWSD for water and sewer services. The judge has set a conference 
hearing on this matter for June 4, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
city’s water system through meter replacement, leak detection, and system repairs. 

Fluron Consulting was retained to prepare a request for proposal to solicit firms to operate 
and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan of 
Adjustment. The city received one proposal from Wade Trim by the submission deadline 
of May 4, 2015. This proposal is under review by the City and Treasury. 

The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20. 7M owed to the DWSD, $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. 

Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014: 

o The city must make major reductions to retiree healthcare benefit costs, 
o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $12M plus restructuring of $4.8M existing 
loans will be requested by the city to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization Bonds, 
$5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund Bonds. 
The status of this request will be reviewed in the context of benchmarks the city 
committed to in their last emergency loan in September 2014. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Wayne County 


Recent Developments 

The Recovery Plan has been released to the public and Treasury has begun an analysis of 
the plan. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Cash reserves reached its lowest point in February 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $22M. The August 2014 cash balance was approximately $150M. This 
number includes proceeds from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

The County’s annual structural general fund deficit is approximately $50M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures. The Plan participants are now paying a larger share of the cost. This does not 
include any saving opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 
The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 


i 



At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
co nd u cted , visit www.michigan.gov/flintwater. 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at knsztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, or by emailing 

flintwater@cityoffiint.com .

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 


2 



assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 


On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 
provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

News Release 


Nov. 9, 2015 

For More Information: 

George Krisztian, krisztianq@michiqan.gov 

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 

As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water 
testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling 
results from Freeman Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even 
individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools 
and other buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. 
“Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing 
fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the 
state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty- 
two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high 
results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or 
plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for 
several minutes, lead levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, 
systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and 
fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized 
flushing regimen. The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing 
period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, 
so we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related 



components where high lead levels were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. 
“Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the 
water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our 
students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have 
access to safe, clean drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling 
was conducted, visit www.michiqan.gov/flintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will 
soon be available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the 
Flint Community Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools 
and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michiqan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took 
advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 
percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and 
more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead 
service lines or in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make

Just looked at it now.... Not one ounce of that post is true and reads like a satire. 

Dave- can you just let your contact know that none of that is legitimate? Plus, if it was from a newspaper, we would

Dave; 

Ithis was forwarded to me, and I ususally do the research myself, but thought you can answer this for me...

Here's the content... 


" Jesper Nymund 

December 24 at 3:01am • Denver. CO ■ 

Breaking news: beleaguered Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has told his fellow Michiganders to "take a deep breath" and 
accept that the deliberate and sustained lead poisoning of the drinking water for the city of Flint was a "long term and 
structural investment" in the human infrastructure of the economically depressed and predominantly African American 
urban area. 

In an interview with Stuart Varney on Fox Business Network Governor Snyder explained that the brain damage and anti- 
social behaviors associated with early childhood lead poisoning would "pay dividends" further down the road. 

"My administration is very business friendly and incarceration for profit is one of those growth industries where we in the 
public sector can do the most good for our partners in the business community. It may take a decade or so before the 
toddlers sustaining brain damage today can be tried as adults and sentenced to long and profitable prison terms. But just 
to let you know how committed I am to this speculation in lead poisoning, Stuart, I can assure you that my personal 
portfolio is heavily invested in the prison industry!" 

Asked by Stuart Varney if the brain damage inflicted on Michigan's African American population might lend "further 
credence" to political scientists like Charles Murray who have suggested that lower scores on intelligence tests by various 
ethnic groups might be genetically based Governor Snyder exhibited winsome modesty in declining to take credit. 

"I couldn't possibly claim to have influenced the science on the issue, Stuart. In all Republican administrations, including 
my own, it is simply assumed that African Americans are naturally inferior in all fields except pro sports and rap music. To 
the extent our little experiment with heavy metal -- if you'll permit me a moment of levity! -- has helped to accentuate the 
natural state of affairs I'll regard that as a fringe benefit." 

That's it, I can't believe it's real -- but is it?? 

Please let me know, so I can (hopefully) correct the record with my friends... 

God bless --

April 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
111 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, MI 48909 


Dear Governor Snyder: 


The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 2011. Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and I feel that 
the financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position 
as Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, I was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of PA 
436 of 2012. I am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint; my predecessors w ere Michael K. Brow n (PA 
4 and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major 
steps toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and 
financial best practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and 
levels of sendee provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

" ' -A 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, 
characterized by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and 
unsustainable legacy costs. At the conclusion of FY12. the fiscal y ear in which an Emergency Manager 
was appointed, the City's General Fund deficit stood at $19 . 1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8.8 
million; and cash flow was $13 million, or less than one month's expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities 
were more that $850 million. 


Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street 
lighting; waste collection was changed to a fee for service from a millage rate; and increases in utility 
rates to among the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public 
safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrank by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 


As a result, much progress has been made: 


• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General 
Fund deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan 
Board. City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have 
been enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the 
requirement for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and 
maintenance of a biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund 
balance reserve, including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a 


1 



requirement to begin funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing 
ordinance. 

Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over 
daily activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City 
operations have been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no 
longer being done internally, 91 1 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 
2015, and the City-funded 68 l District Court is expected to become part of the Count} - funded 
67 th District Court in January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the 
Karcgondi Water Authority instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective 
bargaining contracts have also been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the 
stage for permanent reductions in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the 
level of parks maintenance. Senior Centers are now 7 am by independent non-profit organizations, 
with reduced assistance from the City; and the Citv golf courses have been leased to private 
operators. 

The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new 
Master Plan (the first since the 1960's) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has 
been completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new 
zoning ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces 
significantly engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the 
Flint City Council, with the support of the Mayor. 

A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current 
Charter and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which 
will be elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current 
Strong Mayor form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 


Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work 
on the part of the City leaders: 


• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit 
over its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is 
currently operating under a judge's order which allows modification of the City’s historical level 
of health care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 


2 



• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a 
long term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently 
provides is not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, 
study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint's total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This millage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago. arc 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety sen ices, even with the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This w as recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 100 more officers on the street than Flint does. 

• Equally important to providing State support in the form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City’s lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City’s 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 



Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of P.A. 436 of 2012. the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, I am prepared to say that I 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 21(1) of the Act, a tw o-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved. I recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. I believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to full local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 


3 



If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to 
the historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of 
City leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 


Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

9/21/15 Senior Staff Update 



Hi Dick, 

I hope you and Beth Ann are enjoying your time off! 

This is not an urgent email, just a recap of Senior Staff while it’s fresh in my head: 


Redacted 


OUMI (Hollins): 

Referenced a DEQ meeting with Flint legislators this morning to talk about the water 
situation. DEQ is being accused of not doing proper led testing. DEQ is appearing jointly with 
EPA to refute the concerns. The Flint Mayor is asking for $30 million for piping and testing. 
DENNIS ASKED ME TO FOLLOW UP WITH ANDY LEAVITT, ANANICH'S CHIEF OF STAFF, 
TO SEE HOW IT WENT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE AND I WILL DO THAT.

House activity next week 

Hi Dick, 



Hopefully my last email to you of the day! Just want to let you know what the House is going to be up to next week 
regarding a few issues we're watching/working on: 

HB 4102- appropriations bill vehicle for Flint water. They are going to caucus about it on Tuesday. I'm told Pscholka is 
there on giving the money requested, the Speaker is not quite there yet, and odds are they will have members all over 
the place on it. It is tentatively scheduled for Thursday.

I think those are all of the big ones out on the floor. Please let me know if you need any info. 
Thanks, Have a good weekend!

Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 

Dear Gov. Snyder, 

I'm writing to voice my displeasure with the lack of communication between your office and mine concerning the water 
crisis in the city of Flint. 

Since I have been in a position to represent my community at the Capitol, i have been in constant contact with your 
office to offer advice, help, partnership and solutions. My community elected me to represent them in Lansing, and i 
have been striving to do just that. Several letters have reached your office, and I have been highly vocal about the need 
to come together to fix the water crisis. This has been done with the understanding that we both care about the people 
of Flint, who I represent in the Legislature, and who you represent as governor of this state. 

I have also reached out to Dr. Eden Weils and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality to be proactive in addressing the issue of lead-laced water damaging the minds 
and bodies of Flint's citizens, especially the children. While this crisis could be solved by switching water sources, the 
problems will remain in the health of our future generation. 

i had hoped that this entire problem would have been addressed through partnership, teamwork and cooperation. It is 
unfortunate that hasn't been the case, It is also unfortunate that common courtesy to my office on being kept up to 
speed with any operational changes and financial solutions has not been timely communicated. 

I will continue to keep the lines of communication open as we address the continued problem of health in Flint, and 1 
hope you will take the opportunity to join me in conversation to find future solutions. 


l 


For the Love of the Community, 


Sheidon A. Neeley, State Representative

Neeley update 

Hi Dick, 



Hope you had a good Christmas- just wanted to give you an update on where things stand with the bills, other than the 
police chase bill, Rep. Neeley mentioned in our meeting last earlier this month. 



HB 5094- which prohibits the practice of "pre-flushing" by DEQ, has been sent to Local Government. At this time the 
Speaker's office doesn't think they are looking to move the bill. I've reached out to Maggie Pallone at DEQ to see where 
they are on the bill at this time. 

HB 5120- requires notification to residents within 72 hours for a tier II violation in the public water supply was sent to 
Government Ops. I've also asked DEQ where they are on this bill too. 

The Speaker's office has said that Neeley really wants a hearing on Flint Water, right now they don't think they are 
looking to move on any of the bills, but McBroom was interested in having some hearings on the whole issue in his 
Oversight & Ethics committee. Brock has asked that I touch base with him on this in Jan when everyone is back from the 
holidays.

Re: FDCVT - Preliminary Press Release Info 


Ok. ..thanks. 

Below is what I have though laire Allard, who was on the selection panel, may be able to provide more. 

Flint Incinerator 

The grant project entails shutting down the current Water Pollution Control Facility Incinerator (due to the 
incinerator not being up to new EPA standards). In order to meet EPA standards, it would cost roughly $8.8M 
in upgrades to the current incinerator. The grant funding will allow them to replace the functions of the old 
incinerator by constructing new facilities which will allow for the disposal of waste to landfills. 

Budget Breakdown 

Construction Contractor $1,050,000 

Project Management $50,000 

Total $1,100,000

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 

































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Here is the Amazon Interview transcribed. 

Joe'L Bowling 
Communications Intern 
Executive Office of Gov. Rick Snyder 
517 - 335-6397 


l 



Amazon Interview (transcribed) 

-Any words on the announcement? 

Gov Snyder : The Amazon announcement is very exciting. If you look at it here in Michigan and Detroit, 
particular, it's a place to find great talent, and to see them expanding here is wonderful. It teaches the 
rest of the world that here is one of the most successful companies in the world and it's the place to be. 

-This water situation in Flint is one of our main focuses, but what are your plans to do with that? 

Gov Snyder : Well, there are a lot of things currently in the process. In terms of talking to Flint, and 
working with Flint to help make sure we're getting all the facts and working hard on doing the best we 
can to deal with the water issues in Flint. 

-Nothing more substantial at this point? 

Gov Snyder: Oh yeah, there's actions going on, but I think I'd rather make sure we can give you a longer 
list of comprehensive data taken sometime during the week. 

-Sometime during the week? 

Gov Snyder: Yep. We're working interactively 

-Asked a question about the development of Amazon, (It must be exciting) 

Gov Snyder: It is! It's exciting. It's another step in Detroit's comeback. To say a company of Amazon's 
magnitude international effort is a success. Detroit is a place to find the talent to keep them going 
strong, that's very cool. 

-The wheels are turning in Lansing aren't they? 

Gov Snyder: Yes (laughs) literally. The wheels are turning and we're continuing to make progress in the 
quality of our transportation. Each week we're making some incremental improvements, and hoping to 
get to some point where it's far enough along the road to say let's get the chambers and the legislature 
involved in some long term solutions. 

-And where do you see a solution to fixing the roads? Do you think that we would need tax payers? 

Gov Snyder: Well, I've had it closed off a long time. If you go back two or three years, I talked about a 
combination of gas and registration fees. The other element is what we can do to tighten our own 
dollar. The general funds that help contribute to this service. 

-What's taking them so long? 

Gov Snyder: Oh, we want to do this in a diverse fashion. We need a way to find the right balance 
between helping the person who presents the most priorities. 

-What about DPS, that's also in the hot room? 

Gov Snyder: Yea, we're working on their pieces of legislation in the next 2 weeks on DPS. Not just DPS, 
but the Board of Education. We had a good dialogue with the Detroit Coalition, and we're coming up 
with a number of solutions for resolutions. 


-Asked question about school improvements. 



Gov Snyder: I think we are improving a lot. I want to mention to you very specifically, though, if you look 
at the number of things not included, not into good legislation, but they're actually actions made just 
through the school district or locally. Again, so there's a reason why it doesn't overlap totally. 

-Does that mean that you guys could return to some control at one point? 

Gov Snyder: One of the things I had in an earlier proposal was about the possible transition. 

-Asked question about transition. 

Gov Snyder: Again, I need legislature support to move forward with the transition. 

-Alright, Thank you very much! 

-Another interviewer asked a question about John Suttering and consumer benefits. 

Gov Snyder: He has a tremendous background in energy, you mentioned the service of consumers. He 
had left that quite a few years ago, and he had actually been working for my office before working for 
consumer's office. So, I know him personally. He is an outstanding individual and I know he'll do a good 
job. 

-Now, there is a perception that there is a conflict of interest here. Is there no one in Michigan who 
could've had less of a question about the partiality of this position. 

Gov Snyder: Well, he had fought for this position years and years ago. So, there had been a huge gap in 
service. So, again, he'd lived his life doing many different things in terms of helping my office, in terms of 
helping legislature. There's a major separation of service. So, I don't see that as a conflict of interest. 

-His departure from consumers, turned to 10 years in Lansing. For some people it looks like this position 
is rewarding (couldn't understand his terminology) referring to unqualified persons. 

Gov Snyder: No, it's having a highly qualified person that I have confidence in taking this position that's 
important to Michigan customers, and he's done a lot of great things with the MPSC and our energy 
policies in this state. I expect us to work hard. We're looking at the issues of affordability, reliability, and 
better environmental sustainability. 

-Asked question about the impact of consumers power. 

Gov Snyder: No, again, he left consumers years ago and I don't make decisions based on people giving 
money to anyone. 

-So, you think he has no affinity for his own employer, which he seemed to advocate them pretty 
conveniently? 

Gov Snyder: Again, he worked there in the past, but he separated that. He's had different interests as far 
as looking out for the interests of the citizens of Michiagn 


-Alright, thank you.

Roberto and Bryn, 

I read with dismay the story about Rep. Neeley's comments. It's seems highly unfair that we were never contacted to 
reply. Nor is there any mention of the work the governor has done to assist Flint with its challenges, from the $10 million 
in assistance to the action plan to the work of the Flint Water Task Force or even the recent response from the Office of 
Auditor General. 

Do you have my contact information? I work hard to make sure I am accessible to the media, even on weekends and 
holidays. 

Please let me know if there is an opportunity for us to provide balance to this story.

Flint blood level data 

Flint EBL Data Press Release DM.docx 


Good evening, MDHHS friends, 

Here are suggested changes to the press release. I think it's vitally important to have our "people 
first" approach, and be very up front about the results. I also think it's important to show up high 
what we will do with this data. Please consider the changes. I also think it's worth a conversation 
about whether we want to release this on a Friday morning. This is a challenging situation to be 
sure, but I think these results are fairly encouraging considering some of the heated rhetoric on 
this issue. 

Thank you, 

Dave

MDHHS releases October data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Results show 24 of 963 people tested had elevated levels 

LANSING, Mich. - Blood lead level testing results released today revealed that 24 of 963 
adults and children tested in Flint in October had elevated levels, according to the 
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 





MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to reach out to 
families testing with higher levels and help them reduce their exposure to lead sources. 

Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 963 children and adults 
between October 1 and October 30. Eighteen people age 1 7 or younger had elevated blood 
lead levels. Six adults over the age 1 8 were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The report is intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and 
provide cumulative total numbers. 

“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, 
chief medical executive with the MDHHS. “We have made progress in testing and 
identifying those with elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work 
closely with county health department to reach these families. We will update these 
numbers on a regular basis and remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of 
elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter, and captures both 
capillary and venous blood tests. People who have had multiple tests are counted only 
once. The full report is posted online at www. m l ch i g an. gov/fl Sot water and will be updated 
as more data becomes available. 

The testing is part of the state’s action plan to address health concerns related to Flint’s 
water infrastructure. 

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letter to Flint parents regarding lead 
testing. GCHD nursing staff are conducting direct outreach to families when an elevated 
blood lead level has been detected, serving as an important resources by addressing 
questions and concerns, providing information, and meeting them in their home 
environment. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint 
residents at four locations including the MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County 
Community Action Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of 
distribution, visit www.michi gan , gov/flintwater . 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the 
original when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional on the MDHH S YouTube 
channel . For additional updates on Flint water including updates on blood lead levels and 
testing results, visit www.rnichigan.60v/llint.water .

Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 




Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to 
eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality is 
continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for 
Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Subject: State Emergency Operations Center Meeting Tomorrow 
Importance: High 


Fellow PIOs, 


Gov. Rick Snyder today declared a state of emergency due to the ongoing health and safety issues caused by lead in the 
city of Flint's drinking water. The State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) has also been activated to coordinate 
response and recovery efforts. 


There will be a briefing about the this incident at the SEOC at 9 a.m. Wednesday, Jan. 6. I am asking a PIO from each key 
agency to attend the briefing. 


Key agencies include: 





Department of Health and Human Sendees 
Department of Environmental Quality 
Michigan State Police 
Governor’s Office 

In addition, we will be also developing a public information strategy for coordinating messaging during this incident. 

The SEOC is located at 4000 Collins Road in Lansing. Please enter through the north gate. When you get to the gate, 
please buzz in and tell the guard your name and that you're there for the briefing. 

The SEOC opens at 8 a.m., so if you want to come earlier, you're more than welcome. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks, 

Ron

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on November 
1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 
The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly advise 
the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The city paid 
the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 


www.michigan.gov/treasury 





























2 


Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, and 
began on September 29, 2015. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 1 1, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four- month plan listing the priorities to be 
accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- S700K, and Culture and Recreation- S600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

- Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

- Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates remain 
conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will formally update 
revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year financial plan. 

As die city enters die testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in October 
2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change orders. 
The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to die FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed session 
at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending contract. 

Significant Action/Issues 

The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. The 
report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 



3 


The city’ s four- year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the second 
year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its base year 
with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 17 - FY 20 
budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the first budget 
since the EM's departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and will be subject 
to FRC review and approval. 

At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the Michigan 
Financial Review Commission Act. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 2017. 
Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’ s corporate 
city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 2017. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under PA 
72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM was 
operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 claiming it 
was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the tests necessary 
to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position of 
City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1, 2015. $11 .21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 
in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the final 
copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has been trying 
to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these developments. 

The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1 , 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 



4 


Significant Actions/Issues 

At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four- year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs in 
Year 1. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court-ordered 
mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 meeting. 
The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

- The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

- Benton Harbor is hiring the MML to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Lansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Labor in 2014 of a wage claim filed 
with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety Collective 
Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. Department 
of Labor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the settlement: 1) 
correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from the inception of 
the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission approved the settlement at 
its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the settlement on August 11, 2015. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be sent 
to die RTAB for review. 

Lormer Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 



5 


RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was inaccurate, 
according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and financial plan 
and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire service costs, 
which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance the 
budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griff ea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit. Shears v. Flint, invalidated a previous 
35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This injunction also 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund, prevents the 
city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from disconnecting water service for 
nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction could potentially cost the General 
Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have not been successful. Most recently, 
Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a class action. 

As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
S666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
S1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed an 
appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal because 
the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back to Genesee 
County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is discussing the need 
for additional legal representation with the city.

Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’ s water system after a study 
by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard testing 
shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be adding a 
corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead leaching into 
the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality testing to 
residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case {Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 0.6 
mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must maintain 
adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax Commission Rules, 
and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the city shall implement 
a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the State Tax Commission. The 
city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

- The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation of 
the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the installation 
of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance with the 
federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a 
leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is approximately 1/3 
complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per year. 
On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department to 
the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a hiring 
process. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’ s two-year - budget does not assume 
an additional $5M to $6M annual expense.

The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into sanitary 
sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 15, 2015 
and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 2015 and 
will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review options 
for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial properties. 
Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvements 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare benefits 
made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess

Deputy Mayor. The RTAB approved this appointment on September 16, 2015. 

On July 6, 2016, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the 
lawsuit filed by the city against Ottawa Towers LLC / Phoenix Center. Treasury is working 
with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator which could free up $2M 
in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 19, 2015, the RTAB approved filling the positions of Customer Service 
Representative and Community Relations Specialist. These positions will assist the Mayor 
with community and economic development activities. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme Court. 
The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. The 
lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’ s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the overfunded 
portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the supervision of 
Eugene Driker.

the levy until July 2016. 

On August 18, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled (Trahey v City of Inkster) that 
the trial court erred in determining the city’s 2012 water and sewer rates were unreasonable 
and ordering the city to issue $2.55M in credits to residents for reduced water and sewer 
rates. The city is evaluating this decision. 

The city is collaborating with MSHDA and MEDC to seek new housing developments and

Will you please let me know if anyone will be joining the Congressman for the call?

The Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor, State of Michigan 
P.O.Box 30013 
Lansing, Ml 48909 

RE: Call for Additional Support for Flint Water Improvement Plan 
Dear Governor Snyder: 

On behalf of the Flint community, I am writing with a renewed request for additional support to 
address Flint’s water challenges to ensure that water is affordable and secure for everyone in Flint 
especially our vulnerable populations. I am asking for an additional $30 million in funds for Flint’s 
infrastructure and a new healthy homes initiative. 

Significant progress has been made throughout this year to increase water safety and quality and I 
thank you for the involvement of your office, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 
and the Michigan Department of Treasury. A majority of items in the Water Improvement Plan 
are completed or underway. Most importantly, Flint is now in compliance with the Safe Drinking 
Water Act due in large part to the installation of the new carbon filter. The infrastructure systems 
are being made more secure and efficient through the State grants. Now the City is committed to 
following the recommendation of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to optimize 
the treatment process, reduce corrosion and further minimize risks from lead. 

The need to accelerate the City’s capital improvement investments remains and has been further 
increased by the continued financial stress and legal issues. Previously I requested support for 
replacement or forgiveness of payment to the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund due to Flint’s 
status as a distressed community and the gap in funding in the adopted capital improvement plan. 
I understand that the existing federal law does not allow the existing Drinking Water Revolving 
Loans that Flint is carrying to be forgiven in retrospect but the need still exists. Flint owes 
approximately $20 Million. One solution is for the State to grant a new $20 Million that is designed 
as forgivable from the start. Another solution is to provide

The Honorable Rick Snyder 
September 14, 2015

equivalent funding through an expansion of the grant program to Michigan’s Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships with a supplemental budget amendment in cooperation 
with the State Legislature. 

The community’s heightened concern about lead leeching into the water from old service lines and 
home plumbing also needs to be addressed. We know that lead is an environmental contaminant 
and there have been many programs in place over the years to address sources in paint and pipes. 
Flint needs a new healthy homes initiative specifically focused on lead in water with $10 Million 
to start the process of replacing service lines for the most vulnerable households. Regardless of the 
source and treatment of Flint’s water, this long term threat of lead in pipes needs to be removed in 
the interest of public health. 

My approach continues to be to work with you and your appointed officials. State Senator Ananich, 
State Representatives Phelps and Neeley, Congressman Kildee, community groups, businesses, 
churches, foundations, the Flint City Council, and all of the City of Flint and State and Federal 
government personnel. We need every available expert and resource to address Flint’s water 
problems. 

Flint’s safety is my top priority. Just as the City and State have worked together on public safety, 
we need additional support for fixing the water problems. We need $30 Million in new funds to 
repair and update the city-wide infrastructure and to assist households in becoming lead-free. The 
entire Flint community deserves sustainable, safe, secure and affordable water now and into the 
future. Thank you for the consideration Governor and I look forward to future discussions. 



Mayor, City of Flint 

CC: Flint City Council President Joshua Freeman; Congressman Dan Kildee; State Senator Jim 
Ananich; State Representative Sheldon Neeley; State Representative Phil Phelps; EPA Regional

5. Flint Water: 

• Dan Wyant, along with EPA and MDEQ staff hosted a briefing on September 21 in Lansing 
for Flint elected officials to discuss ongoing issues related to lead in Flint residents' water. 
Congressman Kildee, State Senator Ananich, and Mayor Walling attended in person, with 
Peters and Stabenow staff joining by phone. 

• As a result of the meeting, Kildee released a statement explaining he had no confidence in 
MDEQ and EPA related to how they have handled the issue thus far. 

• Mayor Walling reiterated his request of $30m from the State, which was included in a letter 
to Governor Snyder dated 9/14. Harvey Hollins has been tasked with the response for this 
letter.

Hi there Harvey - 

Just following up on this per brief conversation/mention at yesterday's senior staff meeting and Dave's voice mail to you 
as well. 

I believe you had indicated you had a meeting on this tomorrow, yes? 

We need to touch base and get all facts on this situation ASAP. Turning into unfortunate and unnecessary PR issue that 
we're trying to work with Treasury and DEQto be on top of, stem, find resolution, etc. 

Please call our office today to connect with Dave (as our lead on this) or myself or Jarrod if he's not available for some 
reason. 

Thanks much,

Subject: Backgrounder on Tuesday Flint water event 

Team, 

Here is background on the planned Tuesday event in Flint regarding the $2 million Distressed Cities grant and other 
issues connected to the water issue. 

There are plans for two press releases on Tuesday. The first will detail the two Flint grants and will be released by the 
governor's communications office. The other release, which would detail the other grants, would follow from Treasury 
with a quote from the governor. 

Mayor Walling has agreed to speak at the event, with Harvey Hollins and Dan Wyant representing the governor's office. 
Sen. Ananich has asked to speak, and it has been suggested that Rep. Neeley would speak and it might be better to add 
him to the program. Others, such as Deputy Director Workman and Emergency Manager Ambrose, would be present 
and available. 



The attached document includes details about the planned event, as well as background on the grants from Treasury 
and on the entire water issue from DEQ as well as Mayor Walling's Facebook post about the governor and links to the 
stories in the media about the issue. 

We have a room reserved and are working with the communications team in Flint to have microphones and other items 
needed for the event. 

Please let me know if there is any information you think should also be included, or anything that should be changed. 
Once everyone has had the opportunity to review, we can forward to the governor. 

Thank you, everyone, for your assistance. I know there are lots of moving pieces and many people involved.

Good afternoon team, 

Just wanted to touch base on Tuesday's event in Flint. Unless told otherwise, I'm 
continuing to prepare for the event. 

I touched base with Flarvey and Stacie, who recommended we proceed. Harvey is 
approaching some stakeholders about appearing at the event, and will forward those 
names to me later today. 

I left a message with Dick Posthumus to see if he has any concerns about proceeding. 

The Senate Democrats said Sen. Ananich will want to appear. Katie Carey from the 
House said she would forward information to Rep. Neeley and Phelps. I have not heard 
back from her yet. 

I've attached the backgrounder and the draft releases from Governor's Communications 
and Treasury. I've sent a message to the mayor's office about a quote, but have not 
heard back yet. 

Brad and I spoke about Director Wyant's role and potential comments. He will point out 
that there are things the state can do to help monitor the situation, but also will note 
that the city's water infrastructure is aging, which contributes to the problems. 

We need some direction on an advisory. Should this be listed on a typical advisory from 
the governor's office, or come from Treasury? Do we even issue an advisory in favor of 
just contacting media directly in the morning? 

Please give the draft releases a read for potential changes, or let me know of other 
concerns. 

Thank you! 

Dave

Good afternoon team, 

Just wanted to touch base on Tuesday's event in Flint. Unless told 
otherwise, I'm continuing to prepare for the event. 

I touched base with Harvey and Stacie, who recommended we proceed. 

Harvey is approaching some stakeholders about appearing at the event, 
and will forward those names to me later today. 

I left a message with Dick Posthumus to see if he has any concerns 
about proceeding. 

The Senate Democrats said Sen. Ananich will want to appear. Katie 
Carey from the House said she would forward information to Rep. 

Neeley and Phelps. I have not heard back from her yet. 

I've attached the backgrounder and the draft releases from Governor's 
Communications and Treasury. I've sent a message to the mayor's office 
about a quote, but have not heard back yet. 

Brad and I spoke about Director Wyant's role and potential comments. 

He will point out that there are things the state can do to help monitor 
the situation, but also will note that the city's water infrastructure is 
aging, which contributes to the problems. 

We need some direction on an advisory. Should this be listed on a 
typical advisory from the governor's office, or come from Treasury? Do 
we even issue an advisory in favor of just contacting media directly in 
the morning? 

Please give the draft releases a read for potential changes, or let me 
know of other concerns. 

Thank you! 

Dave

Talking with Jarrod, we're concerned about the appropriateness of state staff participating in another 
round of community meetings. DEQ representatives already participated in a community meeting, and 
the DEQ director and other high-ranking administration representatives took part in our media event 
when we announced the grant award, covering much of the same ground. 

We've also hosted a large group of ministers, again with DEQ, Treasury and Urban initiatives 
representatives, to discuss the issues again. 

Our concern is we've already covered this topic exhaustively with representatives from the highest 
levels, and that it would be redundant to assemble them again, especially so soon after the initial 
sessions. 


We're grateful that Mayor Walling publicly expressed his appreciation for the support from the governor 
and state agencies, especially in light of his critical Facebook post and guest column. We think we've 
made good progress and continue to work with city leaders to help them address their long-term water 
issues.

a different rate ..."? Are you saying that DHS was increasing the maximum dollar amount of State Emergency Relief

Unduplicated Recipients 

Total expenditures

$56,035.26 


In addition, the following reconnect/disconnect fees were paid:

This issue is not something we're going to want our Genesee County DHS officials to comment on. Communication with 
media about the Flint water situation has been handled by the communications staff/ieadership at the relevant state 
agencies. And it wouldn't he appropriate for DHS to get involved in any discussion regarding any water rates in Flint or in 
any other community. 

I can teii you that DHS Children's Protective Services will not remove a child from a home solely because of the lack of 
water in that home. We will work with families to address the issue - by providing State Emergency Relief funding from 
DHS, by suggesting that children use water at relatives' homes, by referring families to call 211 or turn to local nonprofits 
for assistance. DHS also has provided hygiene kits to children in schools and has caseworkers in schools in Flint and 
around Michigan to assist children and families with these types of issues. 

Unfortunately, there are low-income families in communities around the state who at times struggle to pay their water 
bills. Families that meet income eligibili ty requirements can receive State Emergency Relief if they have had their water 
shut off or have received shut-off notices. State Emergency Relief of up to $200 is available for reconnecting to water 
services and up to $175 to pay past due bills needed to reconnect.

Hi Angie, 

I just tried to return your call, and got a message that your voice mail box is full. 

The Michigan Department of Human Services offers State Emergency Relief to eligible 
households that have had their water disconnected or that have received a disconnection 
notice. We can assist with up to $200 for reconnection, and $175 to pay past-due bills that are 
needed for someone to have water services restored or prevent disconnection. We always 
encourage people to try to work with their provider if they start falling behind on paying their 
bill so they don't reach the point of a disconnection. 

I believe you also had some questions about the cost of water in Flint and the cost of 
reconnection. We really wouldn't want to speak to that. I would defer to the people at the city 
of Flint to provide that type of information.

RE: comms update 


If we could add as topics to quickly cover, that'd be great. Beth C is particularly 

concerned about the latter, Flint water continues to be a relatively big deal with Harvey working on several things that 
could be big deals. Might be good to bring up with him too. 


Also, for the quick overview listed first in the top section of roads, we're missing WWJ/CBS radio for Friday. 

We'll be working with Beth E to find phone time for the ones he agreed to last week (Ann Arbor Observer, Rochelle 
Riley, Torn Walsh) - though if you feel we're already good and covered with him, great.

Flint Emergency Manager Authorizes Bond Restructuring to Afford Additional $2.24 Million 

toward Capital Improvements in Water 


Flint, Michigan - March 19, 2015 - Flint Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose today authorized a restructuring of four 
outstanding Drinking Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) bonds to allow postponing current principal payments in the total 
amount of $2.24 million. This action will allow the $2.24 million budgeted for debt service to be utilized for expenses 
associated with maintaining safety and improving quality of the Flint water supply. Approval of the State Treasurer is 
required before the restructuring can occur. 

Flint has recently received a final report from Veolia, its water expert advisor, making a series of recommendations to 
maintain and improve the Flint water supply. These recommendations, and other items identified in the City's current 
capital improvements plan, will be considered as the City develops and implements its action plan to maintain and 
improve the Flint water supply. Discussion on the development of the action plan will begin today, March 19, 2015 at 
the Water Advisory Committee meeting, scheduled to begin at 2:00 pm at the Flint Public Library. 


The State of Michigan was instrumental in allowing the restructuring, as approvals are required by both the State 
Treasurer and the Director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. "At all levels, the State of Michigan 
has been most cooperative in assisting the City of Flint as it addresses the many issues confronting the Flint water 
system", said Ambrose. "Access to $2.24 million at this time will be very helpful in moving forward with our action plan." 




The proposed restructuring will free up funds to enable the City to more quickly begin implementing recommended 
improvements to its water treatment and distribution system. Several recommendations for improvement are currently 
unbudgeted and the $2.24 million will help assure that the most important can be performed. 

Recommendations to be considered include the addition of a Granulated Activated Carbon Filter, estimated at as much 
as $1.5 million; acceleration of the repair and replacement of values, estimated at an additional $120,000 annually; 
additional pipeline replacement, estimated at $1 million per mile; and acceleration of the project to automate plant 
operations, estimated at $450,000. $1,315 million will become available in the City's current fiscal year, and the 
remaining $925,000 will be available in the next fiscal year. 

The bonds are currently financed at a rate of 2.5%, and postponement of the principal payment will incur some 
additional interest expense over the life of the issue. While the interest rate will not increase, the total interest cost will 
increase by approximately 2% ($228,000) over the 20 year life of the issues.

RE: A story about the new filters? 

Hey Dave: 



Bryn is off but ! did share your email with Kristin Longiey and will likely follow up on the charcoal filter system once the 
purchase is complete and we have some details. 

Sometimes it takes several weeks for us to see those EM resolutions after they have been signed but I will keep an eye 
out for sure. 

If you Google Flint granulated active charcoal filter water, you'll see we've mentioned the potential for this type of 
system many times - including several weeks before anyone from the city talked it about it. The news release from the 
city says the purchase is expected to be authorized, which isn't a lot different than we've reported up to this point. 
Thanks for your help as we try to cover ail side of this issue.

Subject: A story about the new filters? 


Hi Ron and Bryn, 

As the MLive alum on the staff, I get to field all the questions about MLive coverage. We just had a meeting and there 
were some questions for you. 

Has there been, or will there be, a standalone story about the $1.5 million investment in the new filter system? 

The concern is that when an outside attention-seeker or local agitator puts up a Facebook post, no matter how 
outlandish the claim, it generates a story and the subsequent social media - and we're grateful for the opportunity to 
comment on those. 


l 


But yesterday the city made an announcement of a tangible effort to address the issues, a true example of the state 
working with local leaders through restructuring the existing debt. That didn't generate a separate post, but was in a 
second post - we're counting the video - about the pastors threatening to sue. It wasn't mentioned in the headline, and 
not until the fifth paragraph. We didn't see any social media traffic on it. 

Usually I can explain to the people here that MLive often spreads stories out over several posts to keep content fresh 
and maximize the amount of clicks. But this one has me stumped, especially on an issue that has been so well covered. 

Are you guys planning a story detailing the new filter system? Or, if we've missed one, can you send me the link so I can 
share it with the folks here to ease their concerns? 

Thanks for the help! 

Dave

particular, it's a place to find great talent, and to see them expanding here is wonderful. It teaches the 
rest of the world that here is one of the most successful companies in the world and it's the place to be. 

-This water situation in Flint is one of our main focuses, but what are your plans to do with that? 

Gov Snyder : Well, there are a lot of things currently in the process. In terms of talking to Flint, and 
working with Flint to help make sure we're getting all the facts and working hard on doing the best we 
can to deal with the water issues in Flint. 

-Nothing more substantial at this point? 

Gov Snyder: Oh yeah, there's actions going on, but I think I'd rather make sure we can give you a longer 
list of comprehensive data taken sometime during the week. 

-Sometime during the week? 

Gov Snyder: Yep. We're working interactively 

-Asked a question about the development of Amazon, (It must be exciting) 

Gov Snyder: It is! It's exciting. It's another step in Detroit's comeback. To say a company of Amazon's 
magnitude international effort is a success. Detroit is a place to find the talent to keep them going 
strong, that's very cool. 

-The wheels are turning in Lansing aren't they? 

Gov Snyder: Yes (laughs) literally. The wheels are turning and we're continuing to make progress in the 
quality of our transportation. Each week we're making some incremental improvements, and hoping to 
get to some point where it's far enough along the road to say let's get the chambers and the legislature 
involved in some long term solutions. 

-And where do you see a solution to fixing the roads? Do you think that we would need tax payers? 

Gov Snyder: Well, I've had it closed off a long time. If you go back two or three years, I talked about a 
combination of gas and registration fees. The other element is what we can do to tighten our own 
dollar. The general funds that help contribute to this service. 

-What's taking them so long? 

Gov Snyder: Oh, we want to do this in a diverse fashion. We need a way to find the right balance 
between helping the person who presents the most priorities. 

-What about DPS, that's also in the hot room? 

Gov Snyder: Yea, we're working on their pieces of legislation in the next 2 weeks on DPS. Not just DPS, 
but the Board of Education. We had a good dialogue with the Detroit Coalition, and we're coming up 
with a number of solutions for resolutions. 


-Asked question about school improvements. 



Gov Snyder: I think we are improving a lot. I want to mention to you very specifically, though, if you look 
at the number of things not included, not into good legislation, but they're actually actions made just 
through the school district or locally. Again, so there's a reason why it doesn't overlap totally. 

-Does that mean that you guys could return to some control at one point? 

Gov Snyder: One of the things I had in an earlier proposal was about the possible transition. 

-Asked question about transition. 

Gov Snyder: Again, I need legislature support to move forward with the transition. 

-Alright, Thank you very much! 

-Another interviewer asked a question about John Suttering and consumer benefits. 

Gov Snyder: He has a tremendous background in energy, you mentioned the service of consumers. He 
had left that quite a few years ago, and he had actually been working for my office before working for 
consumer's office. So, I know him personally. He is an outstanding individual and I know he'll do a good 
job. 

-Now, there is a perception that there is a conflict of interest here. Is there no one in Michigan who 
could've had less of a question about the partiality of this position. 

Gov Snyder: Well, he had fought for this position years and years ago. So, there had been a huge gap in 
service. So, again, he'd lived his life doing many different things in terms of helping my office, in terms of 
helping legislature. There's a major separation of service. So, I don't see that as a conflict of interest. 

-His departure from consumers, turned to 10 years in Lansing. For some people it looks like this position 
is rewarding (couldn't understand his terminology) referring to unqualified persons. 

Gov Snyder: No, it's having a highly qualified person that I have confidence in taking this position that's 
important to Michigan customers, and he's done a lot of great things with the MPSC and our energy 
policies in this state. I expect us to work hard. We're looking at the issues of affordability, reliability, and 
better environmental sustainability. 

-Asked question about the impact of consumers power. 

Gov Snyder: No, again, he left consumers years ago and I don't make decisions based on people giving 
money to anyone. 

-So, you think he has no affinity for his own employer, which he seemed to advocate them pretty 
conveniently? 

Gov Snyder: Again, he worked there in the past, but he separated that. He's had different interests as far 
as looking out for the interests of the citizens of Michiagn 


-Alright, thank you.

Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich Urges Governor, State 

Action in Flint 


FLINT, Mich.— Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) issued the following statement: 


"My constituents and I believe the state must act urgently to provide concrete solutions to the public health crisis in the 
City of Flint. In speaking with Governor Snyder and his key aides today, I stressed the need to work together on a 
number of initiatives that will ensure safe water for Flint residents. 





"My formal request included immediate and long-term solutions, including strong consideration for switching back to 
the Detroit water source until the Karegnondi Pipeline Authority project is complete. Anything less than an aggressive, 
comprehensive approach is simply unacceptable."

Subject: ***Re: Kettering Host City-State-EPA press conference*** 

Hi folks, 

Kettering is hosting the D.E.Q.-led press conference on campus tomorrow. October 2, at 1:30 
p.m. Our contact there, Brad Wurfel, asked that they take up about an hour's time, and Dr. 
McMahan suggested using the Innovation Center as the venue. 

While rather last minute, Mr. Wurfel assures me it will be an important announcement that 
affects our community in a vital way. 

If there are no major barriers that you can foresee, please let's plan on opening the doors there at 
noon so that they can set up, and making the Bluff Street parking lot available for the audience, 
which will include plenty of media, I suspect. 

Paul, can you think of anything else to add? Tom, is that building accessible at that time a 
problem? I suggested they use the lobby and conference room area as their "space," and they do 
not require us to provide any podium or microphones. 

Sorry for the last minute. Questions? 

My cell is

Would you be willing to please work with us on

Re: Can you remove this one? 

Dave, 



I have reviewed the users previous recent comments, and I don't see anything horrifying. He sometimes steps out of bounds 
and calls people pathetic, or imbeciles, or some other type of ad hominem attack. But that's a tiny percentage of his overall 
comments, and when he does step over the line, we remove the comments. 

I see no basis for taking any further action on his account. As for what to tell folks, well, maybe you could remind them that to 
commenters like this guy, they have all the power and they are making decisions that he clearly thinks are negatively 
impacting his life. Maybe if they tried engaging him, it might help.

Thank, you, Jen. Appreciated! 

There is frustration here that such a commenter is allowed to continue posting horrible things every day. Even though 
many are removed, the feeling is that we have to constantly monitor comments to protect against one person who 
seems intent on inflicting as much damage to a person's reputation as he can for the time the comment remains on the 
site. If you look at this person's removed comments, you'll be horrified. Any suggestions on what I can tell the people 
here who are concerned about this? 

Thanks!

This whole tragedy belongs to Pothole Rick and Darnell Earley. Sara Wurfel and her pathetic 
excuse for a husband and human being lie like sleeping dogs at Pothole's bidding. The Wurfels 
have certainly been consistent in their roles as high paid liars for Pothole. So Darnell finally 
breaks his silence in his lame effort to slither out of responsibilities. It took you several weeks to 
craft the lie Darnell. So Sara, how do you explain the sickening display of lying for the year and 
a half that the Flint citizens were being poisoned with Flint River and you criminals continued to 
say it was just fine? How do you lie that one away. Both you and your husband belong in prison 
along with Pothole and Darnell. You people are disgusting.

So glad you dropped a note again, Nancy. Have no idea how missed this earlier - apparently a flurry of

The task force has full independence and our administration has pledged full and complete cooperation, 
it will operate as transparently as possible and there are expected to be opportunities for public input. 
The goal and mission is to conduct a thorough independent review of decisions and practices at the 
state, federal and city level concerning water in Flint, 

The task force isn't a public body (it doesn't make policy and doesn't govern anything). They're a group 
of dedicated professionals who have volunteered to conduct an outside investigation of an issue and 
report recommendations and findings to the Governor. We fully plan on sharing that.

RE: Question about the Flint panel 


Hmm ... let me see what can find out. I do know that each department has a particular process that they follow for every 
FOIA received, regardless of requester, to help ensure consistency and fairness. 

I didn't even know there were possibly any more documents that haven't already been FOIA'd and released.

Man, hope the cooperation for the panel goes better than my attempts to get MDEQ send me the documents I FOIA'd 
that I've already paid for. They're saying it will take a WEEK before their cashier can confirm that the funds (which, per 
my bank, have already left my account) have been received.

The overarching point Nancy is that won't be necessary as we will share report/findings. 
We fully expect people to cooperate and freely offer information.

Just to be clear: The governor's office considers itself exempt from FOIA, so if the report/findings/whatever you want to 
call it is delivered to the governor, it will not be subject to FOIA? Does the task force have a budget to hire investigators? 
It's not a public body so it doesn't have subpoena power, right?

Subject: RE: Question about the Flint panel 

So glad you dropped a note again, Nancy. Have no idea how missed this earlier - apparently a flurry of emails all the 
same time. 

The task force has full independence and our administration has pledged full and complete cooperation. It will operate 
as transparently as possible and there are expected to be opportunities for public input. The goal and mission is to 
conduct a thorough independent review of decisions and practices at the state, federal and city level concerning water 
in Flint. 

The task force isn't a public body (it doesn't make policy and doesn't govern anything). They're a group of dedicated 
professionals who have volunteered to conduct an outside investigation of an issue and report recommendations and 
findings to the Governor. We fully plan on sharing that. 

Thanks and best,

Subject: NPR Interview-Road Salt 

Today I was interviewed by Rebecca Thiele of public radio WKAR-Kalamazoo. 

The interview was prompted by the findings of Western Michigan University, Carla Koretsky, regarding the impact of 
road salt on a small deep kettle lake within the City of Kalamazoo. We are funding a CMI monitoring grant for Dr. 
Koretsky to conduct additional assessment of several urban lakes and the associated watersheds. I provided the 
reporter with the 2 attached reports and the link for a another report prepared by the USGS 

(http://pubs.usgs.gov/si r/ 2011 / 5233 / ). These reports all have sections devoted to chlorides and correlate high chloride 
concentrations in lakes and streams with urban land use. 

Questions-roughly & answers- briefly-no particular order 

1. From the 2007 NLA report, Mi lakes have higher conductivities and chloride concentrations than lakes nationally 
and within the upper Midwest ecoregion. Why? Speculated that compared to the rest of nation, particularly 
compared to the southern states, we have more sources including road salt. Compared to other states in the 
upper Midwest ecoregion we have more lakes in urbanized watersheds. 

2. Will monitoring be conducted at other Kettle Lakes with urbanized watersheds to document the extent of the 
problem? Acknowledged that elevated chloride levels have been documented in urbanized areas of Michigan 
and concentrations in Woods Lake in Kalamazoo are problematic which is why we are funding additional work to 
document the extent of the problem and sources. We will routinely continue to monitor Michigan's resources 
for chlorides but the site specific nature of the problem precludes specific sampling for the issue. We do not 
have a Water Quality Standard for chloride but we have not identified toxicity issues where elevated 
concentrations have been found. 

3. Will construction of roadside retention ditches solve the problem? Explained that best management practices 
for the typical NPS pollutants our agency addresses may not be appropriate for salt. I made sure the reporter 
had a contact in MDOT. 

Air date for the story is unknown.

Hi Brad, 

Our staff are not experts on corrosion or on the chloride concentrations that could be a concern related to 
corrosion. Perhaps we could provide any surface water information we have to someone in the drinking water

Emergency Manager has “broad powers” to “rectify the financial emergency and to assure 
fiscal accountability of the local government.” 4 

While under control of the Emergency Manager, the City faced decisions about the 
future of its drinking-water supply. For fifty years, the City had purchased drinking water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit), which sources water from 
Lake Ehiron. 5 In response to rising water rates charged by Detroit, in March 2013, the City 
Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a newly formed municipal 
water supply system. The KWA was planning to build a pipeline to distribute water directly 
from Lake Huron to mid-Michigan communities, including Genesee County, where Flint is 
located. 6 The City Council’s vote did not become effective until several weeks later, after 
both the Emergency Manager and State Treasurer approved the decision. 7 

The City’s contract with Detroit was set to expire in April 2014, at least eighteen 
months before the KWA pipeline was scheduled to be completed. 8 Faced with a year-and-a- 
half gap in the City’s water supply, the Emergency Manager declined to negotiate a short- 
term contract with Detroit and decided instead to use the Flint River as a primary drinking- 
water source. 9 The City had previously explored — and rejected — the Flint River as a 
primary drinking-water source. This is because the Flint Water Treatment Plant would have 
required fifty million dollars in upgrades to treat the river water and “produce finished water 
in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water regulations.” 10

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule, Flint’s water system 
could not use the Flint River as a water source without first obtaining approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The Lead and Copper Rule 
required MDEQ to approve both the City’s proposed addition of a new water source (the 
Flint River) and the long-term change in water treatment (from treatment through Detroit’s 
water plant to treatment at the Flint Water Treatment Plant). 11 In April 2014, MDEQ 
approved the switch to river water. 12 The City immediately began pumping Flint River 
water through the City’s distribution pipes and into residents’ taps. 

B. Dangerous lead contamination results from the City's switch to river water 

In the twenty months following the switch in water sources, residents’ drinking water 
has been at times cloudy, discolored, and foul-smelling. 13 Residents reported that they have 
experienced hair loss, skin rashes, and vomiting after drinking the water. 14 In the summer of 
2014, the City was forced to issue several boil-water notices after tap water tested positive 
for total coliform bacteria. 15 The City’s subsequent treatment of the water to kill disease- 
carrying pathogens resulted in elevated levels of total trihalo methanes, a disinfection 
byproduct that can cause serious health problems, including an increased risk of cancer. 16

Because Flint River water is also highly corrosive, dangerous amounts of lead began 
to leach out of pipes and into the City’s drinking water. 17 Lead in drinking water occurs 
primarily from corrosion of pipes and other plumbing materials that contain lead or lead 
solder. 18 The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to manage lead levels by 
controlling corrosion, which is often accomplished by adding corrosion-inhibiting 
chemicals. 19 Water systems must implement and maintain an “optimal” corrosion-control 
treatment program that “minimizes the lead . . . concentrations at users’ taps.” 20 

Flint did not consider how to control the corrosivity of the river water before 
switching water sources, nor did MDEQ require the City to implement any corrosion- 
control measures. Rather, beginning in April 2014, the City did not use any form of 
treatment to control corrosion. 21 The City waited until after its residents were drinking the 
river water to assess whether it posed a risk of increased lead exposure. MDEQ endorsed 
this approach. In June 2014, Flint’s water system initiated the first of two six-month 
monitoring periods to test tap water for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule; the second 
six-month period ran from January to June 2015. 22 During these monitoring periods, the 
water system used flawed testing methods that appear to have been designed to underreport 
the lead content of residents’ drinking water. 23

Flint’s monitoring data showed that some residents’ water contained lead at 
concentrations above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion (ppb). 24 These high 
lead levels put residents at risk of abroad array of serious, irreversible health effects, 
including cognitive impairment, kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. 25 When the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) learned of these high lead sampling results in 
February 2015, it notified MDEQ officials that the sampling results raised significant 
concerns about corrosion from lead pipes in Flint’s distribution system. 26 Nonetheless, 
throughout the monitoring periods, the City and MDEQ maintained that these high lead 
levels were isolated and that the data, taken together, demonstrated Flint’s compliance with 
the Lead and Copper Rule. 27 

C. Community advocacy and independent testing prompt long past due 
response from City and State officials 

As the City concluded its second six-month round of sampling in July 2015, and 
notified some Flint residents of elevated lead levels in their tap water, the community 
became increasingly concerned. A small coalition of local groups, including Water You 
Fighting For and Concerned Pastors for Social Action, began working with researchers at 
Virginia Tech to conduct their own lead sampling of Flint’s water. The Virginia Tech 
scientists found that ten percent of the more than 250 samples collected from Flint 
residences had lead levels of 25 ppb or more, well above the federal action level for lead. 28 
Several samples exceeded 100 ppb, and one sample exceeded 1000 ppb. 29 Though aware of

the Virginia Tech sampling results, MDEQ officials continued to insist that Flint’s water 
was safe to drink. 30 

In September 2015, a medical study conducted by a local pediatrician confirmed the 
kinds of adverse health impacts that residents had voiced concern about for months: the rate 
of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels had nearly doubled since the City changed 
its drinking-water source. 31 State officials and the Governor reacted by “ downplay [ing] and 
in some cases attempt[ing] to discredit” the pediatrician’s findings, and dismissing citizen 
concerns as “near-hysteri[cal].” 32 

Subsequent testing by MDEQ revealed that at least four schools in Flint had lead 
levels in their drinking water above the federal action level. 33 At Freeman Elementary 
School, water tested had lead levels over 100 ppb, more than six times the federal action 
level. 34 This increase in lead exposure is particularly dangerous in Flint, a community where 
residents are already at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels and lead poisoning. 
Michigan ranks fifth worst in the country for harmful exposures to lead. 35 Tow income is a 
risk factor for lead poisoning, and more than a third of families in Flint live below the 
poverty level, three times the national average. 36 Children in Flint also face high risk of lead

exposure from lead-paint dust, as nearly ninety percent of Flint’s housing stock was built 
before 1978 (when the federal ban on high-lead paint went into effect). 37 

Finally, in late September 2015, the City abandoned its assertions that Flint’s 
drinking water was safe. Nearly seven months after the City first saw dangerously high 
levels of lead in some residents’ water, Flint issued a drinking-water advisory and called for 
state financial assistance to switch the water system back to Detroit’s supply. 38 Two weeks 
later, Governor Snyder requested six million dollars from the state legislature to reconnect 
the Flint water system to Detroit. 39 With additional funding from the City and a private 
foundation, the switch was completed in mid-October. 40 

Following the switch back to Detroit water, some government officials began to ask 
questions about what went wrong in the course of Flint’s change in water sources. 41 
Governor Snyder created a task force to review water management and testing in Flint, 42 
and EPA established its own task force “to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through 
regular conversations” with the City and MDEQ. 43 Governor Snyder has also announced

plans to launch an “education campaign soon to help schools statewide learn how to get 
their water tested” for lead. 44 

Despite this proliferation of task forces and campaigns, neither the City nor MDEQ 
has announced changes in the City’s lead monitoring practices in the wake of Flint’s public- 
health crisis. Rather, Flint and MDEQ have maintained that these practices are accurate 
and adequate, despite the near certainty that they are underrepresenting lead contamination 
in many of Flint’s high-risk homes. 

II. City and State officials are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Lead 

and Copper Rule 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act) authorizes citizens to sue any governmental 
entity “who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement” under the statute. 45 These 
requirements include the national primary drinking-water regulations for lead and copper 
set forth in the Dead and Copper Rule. 46 The Dead and Copper Rule obligates water systems 
to monitor and control for lead in drinking water. 47 

Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has failed to comply with the Fead and 
Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring water for lead, notifying the public of tap-water 
monitoring results, reporting monitoring results to MDEQ, and controlling corrosion from 
lead pipes. 48 These violations systematically result in the City’s underestimating lead levels 
in its drinking water, masking a public-health crisis. The violations are ongoing and likely to 
recur in the future: Flint’s water system presently is obligated to monitor for lead every six 
months, and there is no indication that Flint has changed or disavowed its inadequate 
approach to monitoring. 49 


44 See Lori Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 13,

46 See id. § 300g-l(b)(l)(A); 40 C.F.R. § 141.80(a)(1). 

47 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 141.86. 

48 Flint’s water system is subject to the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule because it is a 
“community water system” not otherwise exempted from the regulations. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(a)(1), 
141.2. 

49 See Tamaska v. City of Bluff City, 26 F. App’x 482, 485 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Chesapeake Bay 
Found, v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, 844 F.2d 170, 171-72 (4th Cir. 1988)). A water system is required to 
monitor tap water for lead every six months if it (1) exceeds the action level for any monitoring 
period, or (2) “fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within tire range of values for tire 
water quality parameters specified by the State ... for more than 9 days in any six-month period.” 40 
C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). Flint’s water system failed to maintain applicable values of 
orthophosphate and/or pH designated as the optimal water quality parameters by MDEQ. In 
addition, had the water system conducted monitoring in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule 
during the January to June 2015 period, it likely would have exceeded the lead action level.

Under the Act, a “supplier of water” is “any person who owns or operates a public 
water system.” 50 The City of Flint owns Flint’s water system. 51 Upon information and belief, 
the State officials administering Flint’s receivership and the City presently operate Flint’s 
water system. As discussed above, Flint’s Emergency Manager exercised the authority of 
the local government in the place of Flint’s mayor and city council. The Emergency 
Manager managed the water system and conducted its affairs, including making the 
decision to use the Flint River as a primary drinking-water source. 52 In April 2015, 

Governor Snyder removed the Emergency Manager and appointed a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board to oversee the City’s affairs until the receivership is terminated. 53 
The Board has control over the City’s budget, and must approve all decisions adopted by the 
City Council. 54 The Michigan Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act requires the State 
Treasurer to sit on a receivership transition advisory board for any municipality for which 
the governor appoints such a board, and Governor Snyder has appointed the State Treasurer 
(or his designee) to chair Flint’s Board. 55 The City Administrator reports to the Board, 
manages the City’s daily administrative operations, and directs City department heads in 
carrying out the daily activities of the City. 56 To date, the City remains in receivership, and 
its actions remain subject to approval of the Board. 57 

Accordingly, the City of Flint; Governor Snyder; Dan Wyant, Director of MDEQ; 
Nick A. Khouri, Treasurer of Michigan; Frederick Headen, Chairperson of the Flint 
Receivership Transition Advisory Board; Brian Tarkin, David McGhee, Robert McMahan,

and Beverly Walker-Griffea, Members of the Board; and Natasha Henderson, Flint City 
Administrator, are responsible for the violations of the Act by Flint’s water system which 
have endangered and will continue to endanger the health of Flint’s residents. 

A. Flint's water system is in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule's tap- 
water monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements 

The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify a pool of sampling 
sites prior to the commencement of a monitoring period. 58 This requirement is designed to 
target residences at high risk of lead contamination in drinking water, such as homes served 
by lead service lines. 59 In violation of the Rule, Flint’s water system does not select sampling 
sites for lead monitoring based on a pre-established sampling pool. For Flint’s most recent 
completed monitoring period, January- June 2015, the Director of the City’s Department of 
Public Works admitted that Flint “thr[ew] bottles out everywhere just to collect as many 
[samples] as we can, to try and hit our number.” 60 Similarly, email correspondence shows 
that the City has, during several monitoring periods, asked its own employees to submit tap- 
water samples, without regard to whether the employees were part of a pre-selected 
sampling pool. 61 

Under the Lead and Copper Rule, water systems that contain lead service lines also 
must draw fifty percent of their tap-water samples from sites served by a lead service line. 62 
Flint’s water system does not comply with this requirement. The water system reported to 
MDEQ that all the sample sites it used during the January-June 2015 monitoring period 
were residences served by lead service lines. 63 Flint’s Utilities Administrator, however, 
admitted that he was not able to verify that all homes sampled were served by lead service 
lines. 64 This is because City records concerning the locations of lead service lines in the 
distribution system are stored on 45,000 paper notecards. Flint began converting these 
notecards into an electronic spreadsheet this fall, well after the January-June 2015 
monitoring period. 65

Flint’s water system has also failed to sample the same sites across monitoring 
periods or document the reasons for declining to sample the same sites, as the Lead and 
Copper Rule requires. 66 Sampling new sites from one monitoring period to the next is 
permitted only if a site “is no longer accessible” to the water system or “no longer fits the 
requirements of a priority site.” 67 Records show that in the January-June 2015 monitoring 
period, Flint’s water system retested only thirteen of the one hundred sites it sampled in the 
previous monitoring period. 68 It did not provide the required explanation for these 
departures from the previous monitoring period’s sampling sites. 69 Upon information and 
belief, Flint’s water system concentrated its monitoring in areas where it anticipated low 
lead levels, due to recent infrastructure improvements, and selectively retested sites that had 
previously yielded low lead levels. Such selective sampling violates the Lead and Copper 
Rule’s intention that water systems “do not use only those sampling locations with the 
lowest lead or copper levels.” 70 

Flint’s instructions to residents for the collection of tap-water samples also violate the 
Lead and Copper Rule. The Rule allows residents to collect the tap-water samples used to 
monitor lead in drinking water, so long as the water system instructs residents of the 
sampling procedures required by the regulations. 71 Tap-water samples must be “first-draw 
samples,” meaning that the sample must be collected after water in the tap has stood 
motionless in the plumbing system for at least six hours. 72 Flint’s instructions direct 
residents to flush their taps for five minutes prior to letting the water sit for the six required 
hours. This “pre-flushing” has been shown to “result in the minimization of lead capture 
and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water.” 73 The water system’s pre- 
flush instruction “negates the intent of the [Lead and Copper Rule] to collect compliance

samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions,” 74 and goes “against the intent of the monitoring 
protocol, since it changes the normal water use of the homeowners in the sample.” 75 

Flint’s water system is violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s reporting requirements 
by representing to MDEQ that Flint’s monitoring practices are in compliance with the Rule. 
The City’s water system did not provide documentation to MDEQ justifying its selection of 
new sample sites in the January-June 2015 monitoring period, and, upon information and 
belief, is not accurately reporting information concerning whether sampled sites meet 
required regulatory criteria. 76 

The Lead and Copper Rule also requires Flint’s water system to notify each resident 
whose tap water was sampled of the lead results. 77 Upon information and belief, Flint has 
failed and continues to fail to properly notify all residents whose tap water was tested for 
lead of the individual monitoring results. 

B. Flint's water system has failed to maintain optimal corrosion-control 
treatment 

The Lead and Copper Rule required all large public water systems, including Flint’s 
water system, to install an “optimal corrosion control treatment” program by January 1 , 

199 7. 78 After a system has optimized its corrosion-control treatment, the regulations require 
the system to “continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 79 
Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has not maintained an optimal corrosion-control 
treatment program. Historically, the water system complied with the corrosion-control 
requirements by purchasing treated water from Detroit. When Flint switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, it did nothing to treat the Flint River water to 
control corrosion. This failure to maintain optimized corrosion control violates the Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

Although Flint’s water system has resumed its purchase of treated water from 
Detroit, it has not disavowed its erroneous interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule’s 
corrosion-control requirements. Nor has it committed to maintaining optimized corrosion 
control when it switches water sources again this summer to the KWA pipeline. Flint’s 
water system’s failure to maintain an optimized corrosion-control treatment program is 
likely to recur in the future.

III. The State of Michigan's failure to maintain a schools testing and remediation 
program violates the Safe Drinking Water Act 

The Act requires each state to establish a program “to assist” schools and day care 
centers in “testing for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water.” 80 Test results 
must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 81 Michigan, 
upon information and belief, does not maintain a program for school lead testing, 
remediation, and notification. 82 Accordingly, Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Wyant 
are presently in violation of the Act’s schools provision. 83 

IV. Intent to Sue 

The City of Flint and Michigan state officials have been and continue to be in 
violation of the Tead and Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring and sampling tap 
water for lead, notifying the public of and reporting to the State tap-water monitoring 
results, and corrosion control. Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant are in 
violation of the Act’s requirement to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with 
testing and remediating lead in school drinking water. These violations are likely to 
continue and to recur in the future absent a judicial decree ordering City and State officials 
to comply with the Act. If the City of Flint and the Michigan state officials identified above 
fail to cure their noncompliance with the Act within sixty days, Concerned Pastors for 
Social Action, Melissa Mays, ACTU of Michigan, and NRDC will file suit in federal 
district court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and litigation costs, as appropriate.

learn how to test their water for lead, MDEQ has yet to release the details of this effort, including 
whether it will offer the kind of assistance with testing, remediation, and notification contemplated 
by the Safe Drinking Water Act. See Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, supra 
note 44 (Ex. 51).

Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEO. continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEO. continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

Audit finds $3.4M discrepancy in prison meal counts 




2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 











































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

I read with dismay the story about Rep. Neeley's comments. It's seems highly unfair that we were never contacted to

in assistance to the action plan to the work of the Flint Water Task Force or even the recent response from the Office of 
Auditor General. 

Do you have my contact information? I work hard to make sure I am accessible to the media, even on weekends and

PROCLAMATION 

DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY 


WHEREAS, Section 1 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 
vests the executive power of the state of Michigan in the Governor; and 

WHEREAS, under the Emergency Management Act, Act No. 390 of the 
Public Acts of 1976, as amended, MCL 30.401 to 30.421, the Governor is 
responsible for coping with dangers to this state or the people of this state 
presented by a disaster or emergency or threat thereof, and may issue executive 
orders and proclamations, having the force and effect of law to implement the

Public Act 390, MCL 30.403, the Governor shall, by executive order or 
proclamation, declare a state of emergency if the Governor finds that an 
emergency has occurred or that the threat of an emergency exists; and 

WHEREAS, on April 25, 2014 the City of Flint, Michigan switched from the 
Detroit water system to the Flint River as a water source, the harmful effects of 
untreated water struck the city's water infrastructure, causing leaching of lead 
into the water which caused damage to the water system and potential negative 
health impacts to the citizens; and 

WHEREAS, the area affected includes parts of the City of Flint, within the 
County of Genesee; and 

WHEREAS, the damaged water infrastructure and leaching of lead into the 
city’s water caused damage to public and private water infrastructure, and has 
either caused or threatened to cause elevated blood lead levels, especially in the 
population of children and pregnant women, and causing a potential immediate 
threat to public health and safety and disrupting vital community services; and 

WHEREAS, from October 1, 2015 to this date, the County of Genesee and 
the City of Flint have taken a number of actions to cope with the situation, 
including but not limited to, switching back to the Detroit water system on 
October 16th, declaring local states of emergency, activating the emergency 
response and recovery aspects of their emergency operations plan, marshaling

Congressman Kildee (per their requests) on the ongoing water quality issues/controversy in 
Flint 

• Wurfel has briefed Peters and Kildee staff in the past week about lead levels and the State's 
joint role with EPA to ensure that the City of Flint is in compliance with safe drinking water 
regulations. The City is in compliance, but there is a recently-released Virginia Tech study 
that shows dangerously high lead levels from residential water testing. 

• Muchmore has been briefed by Wurfel as well.

Two things of note. Yesterday we sent this Return To Compliance letter to Flint RE total 
trihaiomethanes. 

Also, you might be asking about the optimization letter we sent a couple weeks ago. Thought l sent 
you that, tell me if I did not and Hi find it. This is the one where the testing indicates that they meet the 
standard for lead, hut we still want them to optimize the system because they’re a big system 
(anything over 50,000 customers) and thus need to optimize. This usually means adding phosphates. 


Also, bonus, (see below) I issued this longish quote/statement to Flint Journal regarding lead (and 
used it for interviews today with NBC 25 and Michigan Radio's Steve Carmody. 


Be advised I coordinated a very long interview with the journal today, talking about lead, testing, 
optimizing, homeowner responsibilities, state responsibilities, and more. Hoping for better coverage 
tomorrow. 

Let me know what else you need. Thanks, Eric,

We are aware that Virginia Tech researchers are now testing water at various Flint homes for iead 
levels. We appreciate that. Virginia Tech’s team is working on this issue because it brings the public 
spotlight on an important fact: if you have iead water pipes or plumbing fixtures containing iead in 
your home, or a lead service connection to the city system, it is very likely you are ingesting some 
level of lead. That’s just a fact, it’s true whether you live in Detroit, Dowagiac or Decatur. 

And in the City of Flint, that fact affects 15,000 or more residences. 

However, we want to be very clear that the lead levels being detected in Flint drinking water are not 
coming from the treatment plant or the city’s transmission lines. Treated water leaving the plant has 
no detectable levels of iead in it. The issue is how, whether, and to what extent the drinking water is 
interacting with lead plumbing in people’s homes. 

It does not appear the Virginia Tech research lab is certified, and we can’t speak to the sampling 
methods being employed to achieve these results. The results reported so far fail to track with any of 
the lead sampling conducted by the city, in addition, the Virginia Tech results are not reflected by the 
blood lead level testing regularly conducted by the state department of community health that have 
not. shown any change since Flint switched sources. 


The state’s compliance monitoring program requires the city to use certified laboratories and a 
standardized, federal testing protocol that looks specifically at the homes in communities most likely 
to experience iead problems. The latest results from Flint, obtained from two separate rounds of 
testing over the past year, indicated that Flint drinking water, meets state and federal safe drinking 
water standards for iead. 


That said, the state has requested Flint to ‘optimize’ its water treatment to further limit exposure to 
lead from plumbing in homes. While statute allows several years for a drinking water system to 
actually undertake this process ■■■■ Detroit took five years to complete its water optimization work -- we 
are encouraging Flint water system operators to take these steps immediately and we are 
encouraged by the conversation so far. 

Any resident who has concerns about lead in their drinking water should have their water tested at a 
certified laboratory and get professional consultation on how to address it. The leading cause of iead 
poisoning is known to be lead paint and, in some areas, environmental legacy hot spots where lead is 
present in soils. However, I will say it again: when homes are fitted with lead plumbing or plumbing 
fixtures containing lead, homeowners should assume there is some varied level of interaction 
between water and pipes that results in lead exposure,

In 2015 , we worked hard to continue Michigan's remarkable reinvention, 
addressing our most difficult challenges with Relentless Positive Action. 

Together ; we have come a long way over the last five years, but there is still more to accomplish . 


CREATING JOBS 

» Created more than 420,000 private sector jobs since 201 1 . 

» Lowest unemployment rate in 14 years. 

» September 2015 marked the first month since August 2000 that Michigan's jobless rate 
was below the national rate. 

» Michigan ranks No, 1 in automotive jobs and No. 5 in overall job creation. 

» Launched the Rising Tide initiative, providing economically challenged communities with 
tools to design and build a successful economic framework. 

o vs su as s o 
rUUIMui UUli 

» Secured a long-term, comprehensive, sustainable solution to improve Michigan roads. 

» The single largest investment in Michigan's roads over the last half century, providing an 
additional $1.2 billion over the next five years to improve road conditions. 

» The plan ensures room for smart economic growth while continuing to invest in core 
priorities like education and our local communities. 

BALANCING OUR BUDGET 

» Michigan is five for five in getting balanced budgets done months ahead of the deadline. 

» Ranked first nationally in Index of State Budget Process Quality, and second for most 
improved credit rating. 

» The Rainy Day Fund will increase to $565 million at the end of FY201 6 after being at $2 
million in 2010, 






RIVER OF OPPORTUNITY 

» Restructured state government to put people first and help them succeed. 

» Created the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to eliminate silos in 
state government and better serve our valued customers. 

» Expanded Pathways to Potential into nine additional counties in 20 new schools and 
reduced chronic absenteeism by 37 percent in the 21 9 Pathways schools. 

» Served more than 28,000 families with rental assistance to help reduce homelessness. 

» Ml First Home mortgage program allowed 1 ,563 families to attain the dream of 
homeownership, compared to 1 ,1 03 by this time in 2014. 

FOCUSING ON SKILLED TRADES 

» Created the Department of Talent and Economic Development and the Talent Investment 
Agency to close the skills gap and prepare talent for the highly skilled, technical jobs of 
today and tomorrow. 

» Invested $85 million for skilled trades to develop a skilled workforce to support career and 
technical education and early/middle college programs. This allows students to earn a 
high school diploma, an associate's degree, technical certification, or up to 60 college 
credits through dual enrollment; skilled trades training and equipment programs, and 
increased funding for vocational education programs. 

A HEALTHIER MICHIGAN 

» Celebrated the first year of the Healthy Michigan Plan with more than 600,000 
Michiganders enrolled. 

» Healthy Kids Dental expanded to include Wayne, Oakland and Kent counties and now 
operates in all of Michigan's 83 counties, covering a total of 895,000 kids. 

» Continued carrying out the recommendations of the Mental Health and Wellness 
Commission. 

» Increased support for children and families dealing with autism. 

» Tested more than 1 1 0,000 newborns for severe disorders.

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 











































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Hello there, 

Per recent phone call we're all set to have the WNEM team at the Romney Building for a taped year-end interview with 
the Governor from 3:55-4:05 p.m. this Thursday 12/17. He's hoping to cover some 2015 accomplishments as well as look 
ahead to 2016. Your folks will be able to set up about 10-15 minutes prior to the interview. 

Please shoot me back a note with the names and cell numbers of the reporter and camera man you'll be sending in case 
there are any last minute changes on our end. If you could also send a list of potential topics that would be appreciated 
as well. 

Just holler if you have any questions between now and Thursday. 

Thanks and best, 

Jessica

Hello there, 

Per recent phone call we're all set to have the WNEM team at the Romney Building for a taped year-end interview with

Please shoot me back a note with the names and cell numbers of the reporter and camera man you'll be sending in case 
there are any last minute changes on our end. If you could also send a list of potential topics that would be appreciated

MARCH 2013 

' scil approves resoiution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still needed ( M Li ve 

3/25/13) 

Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 
The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25, may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 


APRIL 2013 

Flint residents seeking water bill relief may qualify for new poverty exemption (4/10/13) 
hose in Flint struggling to pay their water bill may be eligible for some financial relief under a new 
program. The "water poverty exemption" was unveiled during emergency manager Ed Kurtz's news 
conference Wednesday, April 10. The city will waive the "ready to use" fee of $53.78 that is charged to 
every customer each month. 

Flint ending Detroit water contract, DWSD looking at its options (Michigan Radio 4/16/13) 

The city of Flint is dumping its contract with the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Flint 
emergency manager Ed Kurtz signed a contract today to get the city's water from a new pipeline that's 
being built from Lake Huron to Genesee County. Officials with Detroit's system made a final offer to try 
and keep Flint's business. But Kurtz says the numbers were "unreliable." 

Flint, Genesee County officials huddle on Detroit water proposal ( M Live) 

Flint and county officials are meeting this morning to consider a proposal for future water purchases 
from the city of Detroit. And while they aren't passing judgment on what's been presented, Mayor 
Dayne Walling said today that "there does not appear to be a fixed rate" for the life of the 30-year 
contract Detroit is seeking. 


JULY 2013 

Flint to spend $171,000 for engineering to treat Flint River water while KWA pipeline is built (MLive - 
7/8/13) 

The city will spend $171,000 to get Flint's water plant up and running on a continual basis, with the 
potential to use the Flint River as the primary drinking water source for about two years while the 
Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is built. 


Flint River now an option drinking water following Detroit's termination of contract (MLive 7/23/13) 

The Flint River was not a viable option to provide drinking water to city residents when the water 
relationship between Flint and Detroit was stable. But river water might be used temporarily as the 
city's water supply now that Flint signed an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority and will get 
up to 18 million gallons per day of raw water in 2016 from Lake Huron. 

MARCH 2014 

Flint will get drinking water from river next month as nearly 50-year-old pact with Detroit ends 

(MLive 3/4/14) 




"I'm just happy that we are going to be using the Flint River for the next couple of years/' Nolden 
told The Flint Journal on Monday, March 4. 


"I don't think the administration was being forthcoming with information. I'm not against the KWA, 
but I just felt like the Flint River was a viable option." 


eaking set for water plant as Flint prepares to start taking drinking water from river (MLive 

3/11/14) 

City residents will begin drinking Flint River water in April, about a month after city officials host a 
groundbreaking ceremony celebrating continuing improvements at the city water treatment plant. 

Flint residents should be drinking Flint River water by mid-April, officials say (MLive 3/12/14) 

If all goes as planned, Flint residents will have Flint River water flowing from their taps by mid-April. 

"This is an important day for us as we break ground on this new project in the city of Flint," said Flint 
Mayor Dayne Walling. "The river is an invaluable asset." 

Flint City councilman calling for rate drop with switch to Flint River water (MLive 3/24/14) 

City Councilman Wantwaz Davis wants to see a drop in what he calls unfair water rates. 

APRIL 2014 

Flint gets final permit approvals from state to use Flint River for drinking water (MLive 4/10/14) 

The state of Michigan has issued the permits needed for the city to begin using the Flint River for 
drinking water, a major step toward ending water purchases from the city of Detroit as early as next 
week. 

Flint water system study recommends water, sewer rate increases (MLive 4/10/14) 

Water and sewer bills in Flint may have to increase more than $50 a year to pay for the services, a 
consultant's report says, because the rates customers are charged now aren't enough to support the 
city's water and sewer system. 

Editorial: Switch to Flint River water represents new era in Flint (MLive 4/13/14) 

When Flint water customers turn on their faucets on or about April 17 (if all goes according to plan), that 
water will originate from the Flint River. 

"The changeover is expected to be virtually unnoticeable but it is important to note that this 
represents a new direction for Flint." 

Flint makes the switch to use river or drinking water (NBC 25 4/17/14) 

It's the first time in nearly 50 years that water from the Flint River is being treated, and used as drinking 
water. 

By the numbers: A look at some of the figures associated with Flint water switch (MLive - 4/18/15) 
hen the valve to allow the Flint River to flow into the city's water treatment plant opened on 
Thursday, April 17, it was marked as a historic day by city officials. 

Te valve on history: Flint cuts water flow from Detroit after nearly 50 years (MLive 4/25/14 - 
This article has good photos) 

It will take two days before Flint residents can taste history. On Friday, April 25, Mayor Dayne 



Walling turned off the flow of water from Detroit and officially ended Flint's nearly 50-year 
dependence on its neighbor to the south. 


"Water is an absolute vital service that most everyone takes for granted/' Walling said. "It's 
a historic moment for the city of Flint to return to its roots and use our own river as our 
drinking water supply." 

"There have been a lot of questions from our customers because this is such a major change," he 
said. "When the treated river water starts being pumped into the system, we move from plan to 
reality. The water quality speaks for itself." - Mayor Walling 

"The Flint River is a different river than it was the last time we used it - that was pre-Clean Water 
Act," Flint Utilities Director Daughtery Johnson told The Flint Journal last week, adding that the city 
made two years' worth of improvements at the water plant in nine months. "It's a great system. It's 
a great asset the city has. Every drop we pull out, we're going to clean and put right back in the river. 

Flint officially begins using Flint River water as temporary primary water source (WFNT 4/25/14) 

On Friday, for the first time in fifty years, the City of Flint began using Flint River water as its primary 
water source for residents. The valve to the pipeline from Detroit, which had been providing Flint its 
water, was closed. 

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling who was on hand for the event invited everyone to toast to Flint's water 
saying it's regular, good, pure drinking water that's right in our backyard and "this is the first step in the 
right direction for Flint, as we take this monumental step forward in controlling the future of our 
community's most precious resource." 

Flint begins using own water supply (WNEM - 4/25/14) 

The city will start processing Flint river water and officials hope it will be the source of water for the 
entire city. The Karegnondi water pipeline is scheduled to be completed in 2016. 

"We've got the best technology for treating river water. It was there as a back-up, now we'll be able to 
use for a period of time as a primary supply," says Flint Mayor Dayne Walling. "This is a historic step for 
us. It's the day where we actually turn off the Detroit system and turn on the treated Flint River water 
going into our drinking water supply." 

No. Average residents won't notice any difference. The system, as it's designed, has very complex 
treatment standards and systems built into it. As we've talked before, the plant went through an 
extensive upgrade in the early 2000s," says Flint Utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson. 


Flint plans to shut off water pipeline from Detroit today (Michigan Radio 4/25/14) 

After a brief delay, the city of Flint will finally start getting its drinking water exclusively from the 
Flint River starting this afternoon. 

Flint mayor takes to Twitter to see how residents like Flint River water (MLive 4/28/15) 

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling is asking people to rate the quality of the city's new water supply. 

"Everything is going fine on the system," said city Spokesman Jason Lorenz. "The water is of great 
quality." Flint will use the river until the KWA builds its pipeline to Genesee County. The $274 million 
project is expected to be complete sometime in 2016. "I'm a resident - I can personally say the water 
quality didn't change at all," Lorenz said. "I didn't notice any difference." 



MAY 2014 

How safe is your tap water? (WNEM 5/16/14) 

We always assume the water coming out of our faucet is safe. But how do we really know?

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 

































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 











































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Roads SCRUM 
October 13, 2015 


Reporter: Are we at an impasse right now with these roads discussions? 

Governor Snyder: Yes. 

Reporter: Why? 

Gov: What I would say is, again, I'm not going to talk about what goes on in the quadrant meeting. We 
had made a lot of progress in prior meetings. We're at an impasse now. The principals that I've always 
espoused or have espoused over the last two or three years, the issue of gas tax increase, registration 
fee, something with trucks, something in terms of more needs competitive bid, tightening our belt in a 
fiscally responsible way, looking at some tax relief in some fashion. All things that I think we all largely 
found a lot of common ground on. But there were other issues that made it difficult to come to a 
consensus in terms of something to move forward with. So I think we are at an impasse. I made it clear 
to all the leaders that I'm happy to continue private discussions, would like to do that, and hopefully we 
can find some resolution to those differences. 

Reporter: Are we talking about tax relief? Is that really what the problem is right now? 

Gov: Again, I don't want to specify that Kyle. I think it's fair to say that people have different 
perspectives on what tax relief might look like. 

Reporter: Does that mean though Governor, that at least the quadrant talks on this subject will be 
suspended for a while? 

Gov: That's still to be determined. There potentially could be a meeting tomorrow, although there might 
not be. So I'm still figuring that out, but there is one scheduled for tomorrow that may or may not 
happen. There are no other scheduled meetings, and to be open with you, unless I see progress I'm not 
going to schedule more. Until there is a point of getting together. 

Reporter: Is it sort of a 4 and 1 situation again? 

Gov: I'm not going to speculate on that. Again I want to be true to the concept of a quadrant meeting. 
That's why I thought it was helpful to talk through the key points I've always visualized and let you know 
those prior meetings were a good use of time to find common ground on any of those key pillars of what 
I thought should be part of a package. 

Reporter: Where do you go from here? What's next? 

Gov: Well again, I hope people have an opportunity to reflect on it, talk to caucus members, you know, 
think about that. And again, one of the challenges when you do this, this is really about compromise. 

And so I try to remind people when do you compromise, hopefully there's a lot of things you like, but 
obviously when you have the difference in political perspectives you're going to have some parts of the 
package that you probably don't like very much. But part of it is saying 'this is a win for all of us so let's 
move forward'. 

Reporter: You've got to be kinda, um, how do you stay relentlessly positive about all of this? Because 
you've wanted these roads for a long time. 



Gov: Yeah, and I mentioned that to them. I've been working this issue for a long time and that's where 
it's good there's the word relentless in front of relentless positive action. 


Reporter: Governor, do you think that the emergency manager in Flint should be removed because of 
this Flint water situation? 

Gov: Again, in Flint, we've already made transitions in Flint. 

Reporter: He's now the emergency manager in Detroit Public Schools. 

Gov: So again, he's not in Flint at this point in time. So, again, we're continuing to do a review on Flint. 
We've had a lot of action items we're working under and we're going to do an after-action report on 
coming up with recommendations on what could've been improved and how there can be 
improvements for future scenarios. 

Reporter: Do you see in any way as a strike or indictment against the emergency manager law itself? 

Gov: Not necessarily. Let's go do the after action report. The flint city council actually passed a 
resolution approving going to the Caragondy (?) system before it went to the emergency manager. 
Actually they approved that transition first then there's a lot of different perspectives on going to the 
Flint River itself. But the Flint River, again, was a backup solution that was already in place for Flint. 

Sara: Alright, thanks everyone.

Just a few other things I want to bring up with the Governor. Along with his plans for 2016, hHow conversations are 
going with DC about Syrian refugees. The signing of the concealed -tarry bill where prison guards and parole officers can 
carry their weapons in places normally off limits. An pdate on task force findings for Flint water crisis. Maybe if we have 
time talk about effort to save Detroit schools, reforming state's energy policy.

Just a few other things I want to bring up with the Governor. Along with his plans for 2016, hHow conversations are 
going with DC about Syrian refugees. The signing of the concealed- carry bill where prison guards and parole officers can 
carry their weapons in places normally off limits. An pdate on task force findings for Flint water crisis. Maybe if we have

Can we tape an interview from 7:55-8:05 a.rrs. on Wednesday ? 


Hoping sometime we can go live on your show but his schedule doesn't typically give me media time during that hour.

Here's the content... 



December 24 at 3:01am • Denver. CO ■ 

Breaking news: beleaguered Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has told his fellow Michiganders to "take a deep breath" and 
accept that the deliberate and sustained lead poisoning of the drinking water for the city of Flint was a "long term and 
structural investment" in the human infrastructure of the economically depressed and predominantly African American 
urban area. 

In an interview with Stuart Varney on Fox Business Network Governor Snyder explained that the brain damage and anti- 
social behaviors associated with early childhood lead poisoning would "pay dividends" further down the road. 

"My administration is very business friendly and incarceration for profit is one of those growth industries where we in the 
public sector can do the most good for our partners in the business community. It may take a decade or so before the 
toddlers sustaining brain damage today can be tried as adults and sentenced to long and profitable prison terms. But just 
to let you know how committed I am to this speculation in lead poisoning, Stuart, I can assure you that my personal 
portfolio is heavily invested in the prison industry!" 

Asked by Stuart Varney if the brain damage inflicted on Michigan's African American population might lend "further 
credence" to political scientists like Charles Murray who have suggested that lower scores on intelligence tests by various 
ethnic groups might be genetically based Governor Snyder exhibited winsome modesty in declining to take credit. 

"I couldn't possibly claim to have influenced the science on the issue, Stuart. In all Republican administrations, including 
my own, it is simply assumed that African Americans are naturally inferior in all fields except pro sports and rap music. To 
the extent our little experiment with heavy metal -- if you'll permit me a moment of levity! -- has helped to accentuate the 
natural state of affairs I'll regard that as a fringe benefit." 

That's it, I can't believe it's real -- but is it?? 

Please let me know, so I can (hopefully) correct the record with my friends... 

God bless --

The Honorable Jim Ananich ^llll*. 

Senate Minority Leader ,J§|| |r \j 

State Capitol, Room S-105 ^., 

Lansing, Michigan •,. 

Dear Senator Ananich: 

Enclosed are answers to the questions you posed in your October 20, 2015 letter to our 
office regarding the audit we are conducting of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal 
Assistance (ODWMA), Department of Environmental Quality Wllib specific to lead 
contamination in the City of Flint's drinking water, Also enclosed are additional questions 
we developed that are relevant to these issues, along With five exhibits: 

• A map showing Flint water samples by zip code. 

• A map showing lead counts of 5 parts per billion or higher. 

• Two charts showing the number of samples by time period and zip code. 

• A time line of the Flint water review 

We appreciate the opportunity to assist you in alswering questions regarding this topic. If 
you have further questions or a request for other services, please do not hesitate to 
contact our office. 

\ Sincerely, 


Doug Ring I er 

tiiii Auditor General 

Enciliills Jl ' 



Q1 : How does ODWMA ensure the data it receives is accurate? 

A: With regard to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lead 
and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring requirements, DEQ relies on the following key 
controls to ensure the accuracy of test results: 

• State-owned laboratories test water samples, 

• State-owned laboratories send test results dtrectly to QJEQL 

• The City of Flint Water Treatment Plant (Flint WTP) certifigfl U fo e ther 

sample sites are classified as tier 1*, 

The current Flint WTP LCR sampling process includes: ' ' w 

1 . DEO informs the Flint WTP of -regia reef water lead and copper 
sample size. 

2. The Flint WTP determines the pool of tier 1 sites for sampling. 

3. The Flint WTP sefects the sample. 

4. The Flint WTP sends out sample kits and instructions to residents for 
collecting water samples. _ < 

5. Residents leave samples and signed sampling forms outside their front 
doors. 

6. The Flint WTP employee ptcks up samples and forms from residents. 

X The Flint WT P effiplbyee reviews sample forms for completeness. 

8. ITiO Flint WTP employee sends samples to the State-owned 
laboratories. 

SL State-owned laboratories test samples and provide results directly to 

I i|j| Q . 

10. DEO receives water lead and copper sample results, which include 
the following information: date collected, date received, address 
where collected, type of residence (e.g., single family or apartment), 
and sample point (e.g., kitchen sink or bathroom sink). 

1 1. DEQ tracks, and follows up if necessary, the number of samples 

collected by the Flint WTP to help ensure that the required minimum 
number of samples are collected by the monitoring period deadline. 


Single-family or multiple-family residence with lead service line, lead solder copper piping 
constructed after 1982, or lead plumbing. 


Page 1 


1 2. The Flint WTP submits lead and copper report to DEQ that certifies 
whether sample sites meet tier 1 criteria. 

13. DEQ prepares the LCR 90th percentile calculation report. 

During our review, we noted two potential improvements for the Flint WTP 
sampling process (see Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the 
OAG regarding tier 1 sample validity): 

• DEQ could verify that the sampling pool was limited to only tier 1 sample 
sites to ensure that the Flint WTP is in compliance with the LCR 

(Title 40, Part 141, section 86(a)(3) of the Code of Federal Regulations 
[ CFR ]). 

• DEQ could independently verify the validity of sample certifications. 


Q2: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who fail to fi||vv data 

verification protocols? ^ 

A: DEQ does not provide any direct oversight over the Flint WTP and, therefore, 
does not have any accountability measure® over the Flint WTP's LCR data 
verification protocols. DEQ's data verification protocol for lead and copper 
water sampling is limited to verification that the WTP certifies samples 
submitted to the State-owned laboratories for analysis (see steps 7 and 1 2 in 
the Flint WTP LCR sampling process noted in Ouestton 1 above). We did not 
identify any instances in which ODWMAstaff failed to verify that submitted 
samples were certified by tbejpnt WTP. 


Q3: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who lie or 

misrepresent information to the EPA? 

A: As with all classified employees, ODWMA staff must adhere to the rules and 
regulations established by the Michigan Civil Service Commission. If any 
ODWMA staff were determined to misrepresent information to the EPA, they 
would b^sybieoTto Civil Service Rule 2-6, Discipline, which allows an 
appointing authority to discipline an employee for just cause up to and including 
dismissal. We are not aware of any DEQ-established measures that are in 
addition to the Civil Service Rules. 

We gained access to the e-mail accounts of key DEQ management (DEQ 
Director, Deputy Director, ODWMA Chief, and other key ODWMA staff) 
extending back to January 1 , 2013. We did so to identify the key decision 
points and conversations that occurred leading up to and through the situation in 
ii Flint. Our review was also intended to determine whether State, Flint, or other 
officials attempted to conceal key test results or other information. 

We noted one e-mail exchange between DEQ and the EPA that appears to be a 
significant contributor to the concern that DEQ misrepresented information to 
the EPA. The EPA requested clarification on February 26, 2015 regarding the 
type of optimized corrosion control treatment the Flint WTP was using. DEQ 
responded on February 27, 2015 that the city had an optimized corrosion 
control program in place, but DEQ did not provide any program details. DEQ 
informed us that the Flint WTP corrosion control program included performing 


Page 2 



lead and copper monitoring for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 
whether corrosion control treatment would be necessary in the future. 

However, it appears the EPA interpreted corrosion control program to mean that 
corrosion control treatment was being performed. 

On April 23, 2015, the EPA again inquired as to what the Flint WTP was doing 
for corrosion control treatment. DEQ responded on April 24, 2015 that the Flint 
WTP was not practicing corrosion control treatment. 

Based on our review of this and other e-mails, we have no specific reason to 
believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented the information to the EPA. 


Q4: What policies do DEQ and ODWMA have in place to escalate major infractions up 

the chain of command? 

A: We did not note any instances of major infractions (i.e., intentional disregard of 
policies, laws, regulations or specific directions) committed by DEO staff during 
the course of our review. DEQ does not have a formal policy or procedure in 
place to escalate major infractions performed by ODWMA employees; however, 
our review of DEQ correspondence confirmed the escalation of key issues up the 
chain of command related to the Flint situation, DEO stated that its informal 
policy is for staff to notify the proper level of management of infractions to 
determine necessary action.. ^ Mlk 




Application of the LCR 

Q1 : How did the Flint WTP become the primary water supplier for the City of Flint? 

A: Upon notification of the City of Flint's plans to switch to the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) in April 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department 
(DWSD) submitted a letter to the City of Flint stating that If would terminate its 
agreement to provide water services on April 17, 2014. 

According to DEQ management, the Flint WTP attempted to negotiate with the 
DWSD to maintain it as the City of Flint water supplier; however, after 
negotiations were unsuccessful, the City of Flint notified DEQ through a permit 
request of its intent to operate the Flint WTP full time using the Flint River. 
Although the Flint City Council voted in March 2013 rrfsupporl of moving to the 
KWA pipeline, the vote was silent on the use of the Firrt River as a temporary 
drinking water source. 

The Flint River was approved by DEQ in 2006 as a backup source of water for 
emergency purposes prior to the switch from the DWSD WTP to the Flint WTP. 
On a quarterly basis, the Flint WTP tested the treated Flint River water at the 
Flint WTP, which met water quality standards; however, the Flint WTP did not 
test the water's effect on the distribute system at consumer tap locations. 

Q2. Did DEQ consult with the EPA prior to determining how to apply the LCR? 

A: DEQ did not consult With the ERA on how to apply the LCR prior to 

implementing two consecutive six-month monitoring periods of the Flint WTP 
beginning July 1 , 2014, Based on past experiences applying the LCR monitoring 
requirements, DEQ believed that it had appropriately applied the LCR 
requirements of a large water system. 


Q3: When Flint switched to the Flint River water source, should corrosion control 

treatment have been maintained? 

A: We believe that corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 

According to the LCR, a water system can achieve optimized corrosion control if 
it submits results of tap water monitoring for two consecutive six-month 
monitorinq||>eriods with acceptable lead levels. However, a water system that 
has optimized corrosion control, and which has treatment in place, should 
x continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment. 

DEllplaff explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a 
new system, but as a new source. DEQ further stated that because the Flint 
River was a new water source and there was a change in chemicals needed to 
treat the new source, a corrosion control study was needed to determine the 
impact on the water distribution system. Therefore, it was DEQ's interpretation 
that two rounds of six-month monitoring were still needed to evaluate the water 
quality and determine optimal corrosion control treatment. 


Page 4 


The Flint water system had optimal corrosion control treatment when the DWSD 
WTP was the water supplier. Based on our review of notes from a July 21 , 
2015 EPA and DEQ conference call on DEQ's implementation of the LCR 
regarding whether the Flint WTP should have continued to maintain corrosion 
control treatment, it appeared that the EPA did not agree with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR. Region 5 EPA staff explained that they would talk to 
the EPA headquarters about the interpretation of regulations and believes that 
systems that have been deemed optimized need to "maintain" corrosion control. 
The Region agreed to provide supporting regulatory citation%:|||the language 
about maintaining corrosion control. 

On November 3, 201 5, the EPA issued a memorandum stating that the LCR had 
differing possible interpretations; however, the EPA concluded that it is 
important for large water systems to take the steps necessary to ensure that 
appropriate corrosion control treatment is maintained at all times, thus ensuring 
that public health is protected. Based on this clarification, it appears that 
corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 


Q4: Should DEQ have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized corrosioh|P 

control treatment after the first round of six-month sampling results were above the 
lead action level of 5 parts per billion (ppb)? 

A: Yes. According to DFO's application of the LCR, within six months after the 
end of the monitoring period in which the water sample results exceeded the 
acceptable lead level, DEQ should have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing 
optimized corrosion control treatment. 

The LCR states that the lead action level is exceeded if the lead level, as 
determined by the 90th percentile calculation, is greater than 15 ppb. If the 
lead action level is exceeded, water systems are required to take additional 
actions including educating the public about lead in drinking water as well as 
commencing lead service line replacement if the water system has already 
installed corrosion control and/or ssjurce water treatment. However, for water 
systems that have not yet implemented corrosion control treatment, they can be 
deemed to have optimized corrosion ddntrol without installing treatment if they 
can derh^iStretS: tead levels below 5 ppb for two consecutive six-month periods. 

Ihe first round of six-month sampling results was received in late March 2015. 
Because the results were 1 ppb over the lead action level of 5 ppb, DEO would 
not be able to achieve two consecutive six-month periods below 5 ppb. 
Therefore, DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized 
corrosion control treatment. However, DEQ waited until the second round of 
sampling completed (June 30, 2015) to assess whether water sample 
results improved. 

Water Samples 

Q5: Did DEQ verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected by the Flint WTP in the 

two roiMds of six-month samples? 

A: DEQ did not verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected. DEQ relies on 
the Flint WTP's certification of sample sites and does not perform any 
independent verification of those certifications. 


Page 5 



In a November 19, 2015 Flint Journal article, the Flint WTP indicated that it did 
not have the ability to ensure that all sites were tier 1 . In fact, water samples 
came from the random distribution of 175 testing bottles without regard for 
whether the homes were at risk for high lead levels. DEQ issued a formal 
memorandum on November 9, 2015 requesting that the Flint WTP verify the 
classification of all prior sample items. The results are due back from the Flint 
WTP on December 30, 201 5. 


Q6: DEQ dropped two water sampling sites from its second six-month sample 

(January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015). Was this appropriate? 

A: Yes, it was appropriate for DEQ to drop these two water sampling sites. Federal 
regulation 40 CFR 141.86(a) states: 

"... each water system shall complete a materials evaluation 
of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted 
sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section . . . 

All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be 
selected from this pool . . . Sampling sites may not include 
faucets that have point-of-use of pojnt-of-en.fry treatment 
devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants." 

This regulation also requires that a water system's targeted sampling pool 
consist of only tier 1 sampling sites if an adequate number is available to meet 
monitoring requirements. 

According to federal regulation 40 CFR 141.86(f), the State may invalidate a 
water sample if it determines, that the sample was taken from a site that did not 
meet the site selection criteria.!! A sample invalidated per this regulation does 
not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels or toward 
meeting the minimum monitoring requirements. 

DEQ dropped one water sample site from its 90th percentile calculations 
because the site was from a business that does not meet the tier 1 requirements 
of being a single-family or multiple-family residence. The second sample site 
was dropped because the home had a point-of-entry treatment device to filter 
contaminants, Based on the criteria specified above, it appears that DEQ’s 
rationale for dropping the samples from these two sites appropriately met the 
requirements for invalidating samples per federal regulation 40 CFR 141.86. 


;Q7: Was flushing of the taps the night before drawing a sample an appropriate sample 

methodology? ||||. 

A: Yes. The ICR requires that samples be a first draw of water after six hours of 
stagnation. The LCR does not indicate whether or not the water line should be 
flushed prior to collecting the sample. In the sample instructions, DEQ required 
vpreflushing to ensure that sampled faucets were not stagnant for an excessive 
period of time beyond the targeted six hours (e.g., rarely used faucets or when a 
horrifbwner has been gone for an extended period of time.) 

The LCR requires six hours of stagnation; however, it does not preclude DEQ 
from instructing residents to flush prior to stagnation. 


Page 6 




In calendar year 1992, the Flint WTP established a tier 1 sample site pool for LCR 
monitoring. With the change to the Flint River water, the Flint WTP needed to increase the 
pool of sample locations because of additional sampling requirements. The following 
exhibit documents the 2014 and 201 5 sample locations for LCR monitoring. Based on the 
data obtained during our review, we could not determine how the locations were selected 
or whether they were properly classified as tier 1 sample sites. 

As noted in Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the OAG, DEQ has 
requested the Flint WTP to verify the tier 1 classification of all prior sarfilflaitems.

Dear Governor Snyder: 


The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 
This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 



this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 


A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 
legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 

We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 





time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 


We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDHHS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community.

I have received all of the input provided and thank you. The following highlights: 

■ The only two "enterprise wide" folks we have as Coordinators are Harvey Hollins and Chris 

Kalenske. I have changed their titles to reflect a coordination/facilitation role and not connote 
"We are in charge and to hell with everyone else". Therefore I have changed the org chart and 
created a "dotted line" depiction— and also added the Legislative body as they (or subsets) may 
have a role here as well. 

■ But make no mistake, we are going to be accountable whether we should be or not so we are not 

syndicated the leadership that comes with the coordinating roles. I rewrote certain pieces of 
the proposal to reflect our inclusion, equality and partnership. But make no mistake, Harvey 
and Chris are the guys who will make this coordination effort work and if either of them 
encounter resistance with any of our partners in this effort, I have pledged to have their backs 
using my persuasive charm and bankruptcy tested mediation skills... 

■ I did not bring in more departments at this time. That is not to say they would not be value add, 

but there is a difference between an emergency response and planning effort, and introducing 
some other ways to get help and support to Flint. We will do that too, but not at this time. 

■ I have attached Tim Becker's Supplemental Request. Note that even at $6 million over 2 years it 

does not include funding for the sort of long term monitoring of consequences of lead impact. 

■ Lastly I want people to know that we are committed to a spirit of inclusion, even with those who 

have been relentless in their attacks without offering any insights to solutionality. But some of 
these people have a stronger interest in advancing their own personal agenda and not devoting 
any real efforts to solving real problems. They will only be welcome if they decide to pursue the 
latter behavior vs. the former. 

Unless someone thinks I really botched something up in the proposal, I would now ask Jarrod to give it 
final blessing and share with the Governor to get confirmation on the way forward. 


Thanks everyone for a less than 24 hour turnaround and..

• Beginning immediately, we're viewing this as an emergency and are not waiting to get moving on this problem. 
We're working closely with Mayor Weaver and other city and county officials to bring together state, county and 
city agencies and stakeholders to coordinate efforts and streamline communication.

Flint water 

• In response to the elevated blood lead levels found in some Flint children, the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services has worked closely with partners at the state and 
local level to educate families and providers to protect the health of Flint residents. The 
following actions are a result of the state's action plan to address health concerns related to 
Flint's water infrastructure, released by Gov. Rick Snyder: 

• MDHHS has provided funding to Genesee County Health Department for nurses to work with 
families when an elevated blood lead level has been detected. 




During these follow-up visits, nurses coordinate with environmental health investigators to 
meet with families in their homes to identify lead exposures, address questions and provide 
water filters. People can be exposed to lead from paint, soil, plumbing and other sources. 
MDHHS attained and continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint 
residents at four locations, including the MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County 
Community Action Resource Department. 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional video on its YouTube channel. 

MDHHS collaborated with the Genesee County Health Department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letters to Flint parents and providers 
regarding lead testing. 

MDHHS has created a new regular summary report to update the public regarding testing and 
the total number Flint adults and children with elevated blood lead levels. 

With this data being tracked closely, MDHHS is working with the nurses at the Genesee County 
Health Department to ensure follow up and case management for every family.

Hello Team PIO, 

Reaching out to you on behalf of Dave and the Governor's strategy team. It's about that time of year when we start to 
work on the State of the State address and plan for year-end media, which means it's also the time of year that calls 
for year-end accomplishments. As in years past, please pull together those initiatives, strategies, success stories, etc. 
that highlight the great work being done in each of your departments over the last 10 months. Please aim to send 
something our way by EOB this Friday, Nov. 13. I've attached an example report from DTMB for reference. Once all of 
the reports are compiled this ends up being a massive document, we ask that you try to trim down your 
accomplishments as much as possible while still being thorough. Bullet points and brief summaries tend to be most 
helpful. 

Please include: 

• Accomplishments document 

• A few particularly strong news articles you may have kept on file 

• 3-5 photos illustrating some of the key accomplishments 

• Captions for the photos 

If anyone has any questions, give either myself or Dave a shout. Thanks much in advance! 

Best,

LARA 2015 Accomplishments and Highlights 


The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs had another successful year in its efforts to 
improve the state’s regulatory environment and make the delivery of services more efficient for 
consumers and business customers. Through the oversight of the department’s diverse 
bureaus, agencies and commissions, LARA safeguards Michigan citizens and supports 
business growth. Below are accomplishments and highlights for 201 5. 

Reinventing Performance in Michigan (RPM) 

• The process improvement initiative began to expand to all state departments and 
continued to see positive results from the business community. A survey of Michigan 
businesses showed the state’s regulatory and business climates have improved 
significantly since 2013. Customers of the state’s three primary regulatory agencies - 
DEQ, LARA, and Treasury - were surveyed. 

These improvements include: 

o Advocacy improved 19%, a 10-point increase in business customers willing to 
recommend Michigan as a place to start a business to a friend or colleague, 
o Business Climate Perception improved 19%, a 10-point increase in business 
customers’ positive perception of the business climate in Michigan, 
o Regulatory Climate Perception improved 23%, a 10-point increase in the positive 
perception of the regulatory climate in Michigan, 
o Trust improved 30%, a 13-point increase in respondents trust in the State of 
Michigan's regulatory agencies. 

. Through RPM, LARA continues to engage employees and implement lean processes in 
order to improve customer services. 

LARA’s RPM results to date: 

o 34% improvement in LARA business customers’ perception of Michigan’s regulatory 
climate. 

o Improved customer response timeliness by cutting 37 key processing times by 77% 
o 61 % reduction in the number of forms. 

o Reviewed 3,386 customer-facing materials for business utility, and identified and 
eliminated any un-promulgated mandates. 

Office of Good Government (OGG) 

• The OGG became part of LARA in January 2015. The OGG has made a concerted effort 
to become more cohesive and is marketed to all state employees through a number of 
improved initiatives: 

o The OGG website was launched in August 2015. 

o The OGG newsletter was revamped and now goes to all state employees and is 
viewed by more than 30,000 state employees each month. 

The OGG now works closer with all state departments through the RPM initiative, the 
coin recognition program and state employee leadership training. 


o 



o The OGG now manages employee engagement strategies for all departments 


• In March 2015, the OGG surveyed all State of Michigan employees and saw the following 
improvements: 

o Employee participation was at an all-time high with 71% of employees participating in 
the survey, compared to 68% in 2013 and 58% in 2012. 
o 61 % of state employees agreed that their departments encourage innovation, support 
teamwork and openly communicate - up from 58% in 2012. 
o More than half of state employees have high engagement, a first in three years, 
o 61-65% of agencies (vs. 41-50% in 2013) are above high performing and services 
benchmarks. 

Michigan Office for New Americans (MONA) 

• Under executive order, MONA became part of LARA in March 2015 in order to 
strengthen Gov. Snyder’s priority to establish Michigan as a prime destination for 
immigrants. 

• MONA created the Michigan Talent Solutions program to support skilled and permanently 
work-authorized immigrants’ return to their professional careers. Partnering with national 
nonprofit, Upwardly Global, MITS will train international job seekers (particularly those 
with STEM backgrounds) to succeed in the professional job search process in Michigan. 

• To address the governor’s mandate of creating a more welcoming Michigan, MONA 
convenes the stakeholders of Global Michigan and the Ethnic Cabinet quarterly to share 
and develop best practices with regard to immigrant integration. The 57 stakeholders of 
Global Michigan representing ethnic chambers, commissions, and councils; local 
governments and chambers; universities; welcoming organizations and economic 
developers, strive to retain and attract international and entrepreneurial talent to the 
state. 

• MONA partnered with Welcoming Michigan to help expand its Welcoming Cities & 
Counties program developed by Welcoming America. Welcoming Cities & Counties 
works with communities to plan for long-term integration; that commit to institutionalizing 
inclusion efforts; that communicate messages of unity; and that sustain policies to ensure 
interactions between new and long-time residents are positive. 

Office of Regulatory Reinvention (ORR) 

• Michigan’s regulatory systems have become more efficient for consumers and business 
customers, as the ORR rescinded more than 2,000 obsolete rules. Since Gov. Snyder 
created the ORR in 201 1 to increase the efficiency of Michigan's government, the office 
has worked closely with all state departments to reduce the administrative burdens for 
state departments and make compliance issues more efficient for businesses and 
consumers. 

• To date, the office has reviewed more than 1 9,000 rules and 900 rule sets, collected 
nearly 35,000 pages of non-rule regulatory actions and removed 3,573 unduly restrictive 




Ml Agency for Energy (MAE) 


• Creation of the MAE has successfully integrated state energy policy and programs into 
one location and allowed better representation for Michigan on high-impact issues. 

• MAE forged successful multi-agency partnerships on several important energy issues 
including EPA carbon rule, pipeline safety, coal unit retirements and low income heating 
assistance. 

Ml Public Service Commission (MPSC) 

• The MPSC completed an investigation into electric capacity that, for the first time, looked 
at the ability of certain electric providers to meet their customers’ expected electric 
requirements over a five-year period. That investigation determined that although efforts 
have been made to shore up supplies, Michigan needs to remain focused on its efforts to 
ensure there are adequate resources beyond 2016 to cover its anticipated load and that 
electric resources are reliable, affordable and environmentally protective. 

• The Commission approved new rates for commercial and industrial electric customers 
that are more competitive, while maintaining affordable rates for residential customers. 

• The MPSC launched a natural gas price comparison website that helps customers make 
informed decisions when choosing a provider. 

Workers’ Compensation Agency (WCA) 

• Michigan’s workers’ compensation system continues to demonstrate to job seekers and 
employers that our state has the right regulatory environment for economic growth while 
still protecting injured workers. Under the WCA, the pure premium advisory rate for 
workers' compensation insurance will drop by an average of 6.9% in 2016, a 32.7% 
decrease since 2011, saving employers an estimated $327 million. 

• Amendments to the Workers’ Compensation Health Care Services rules and fee 
schedule addressed the problem of long-term use of opioids by injured workers and 
helped reduce medical costs for the state’s job providers. The amended rules prevent 
reimbursements for opioid treatment beyond 90 days for non-cancer related chronic pain, 
unless detailed physician reporting requirements are met. 

Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA) 

• Received the William Q. Wierhdt Customer Service Award for the success of the 
MIOSHA Safety and Health Improvement Program, which resulted in Michigan small 
businesses investing more than $1 million toward the purchase of safety and health- 
related equipment. 

• Michigan’s injury and illness rates for private industry dropped from 3.7 in 2013 to 3.6 in 
2014, continuing a downward trend in work-related injuries since 1999. This is due in part 
to the agency’s strong collaboration with the employer community, involving nearly 100 



businesses, labor groups and other organizations across the state that have partnered 
with MIOSHA through one of its cooperative programs. 



Michigan Liquor Control Commission (MLCC) 


• The MLCC Licensing Division reviewed state liquor laws and found there were no 
requirements that applicants complete a contract for licensure that was contained in the 
final stage of the licensing process. The MLCC eliminated the preparation of the closing 
packet - a process that previously took weeks to complete - allowing applicants to 
receive their Commission order sooner and coordinate the closing with the bank and 
sellers significantly faster. 

• The Commission eliminated paper fingerprint records and began accepting electronic 
records. A process that took weeks or even months to complete is now completed in as 
little as one day. 

Michigan Administrative Hearing System (MAHS) 

• The MAHS Benefit Services Division Team achieved an outstanding 100% timeliness 
score during the 2015 federal food assistance program audit of the 60-day hearings 
resolution requirement. The team challenged itself to improve the 2014 98% 60-day 
timeliness achievement and again worked on reinventing performance management 
throughout 2015. The administrative law judges’ suggestions for designing case status 
log reports provided optimal information on the true case age of each decision waiting to 
be written. 

Bureau of Fire Services (BFS) 

• The BFS replaced the outdated Information Management System (IMS), which tracked 
the state’s firefighter training and certifications, with the new and improved System 
Maintenance of Knowledge and Education (SMOKE) system. SMOKE was specifically 
designed with enhanced capabilities and many added functionalities while keeping the 
system user friendly. 

• The BFS along with BCC and BCHS has begun the initiative to transition its Plan Review 
division to accept and process plans from industry in an electronic format at a single point 
of entry. Completion of project in FY 16. 

Bureau of Services for Blind Persons (BSBP) 

• The BSBP’s Braille and Talking Book Library (BTBL) was named the National Library of 
the Year by the Library of Congress for its outstanding performance. The BTBL circulated 
23% more books; took 20% more phone calls from patrons through greater staff 
efficiencies; and issued 24% more digital playback machines to qualifying patrons. BTBL 
served 1 1,300 patrons, providing books in alternative formats for Michigan residents who 
cannot read standard print materials due to a visual or physical disability. 

• The BSBP Training Center, a 24/7 residential facility, provided individually tailored 
training services to help blind and low vision students reach their maximum potential and 
highest goals. The center reduced the backlog of the student wait time by more than 
20%, and the waiting list was reduced from 45 to 9 individuals. At year’s end, only 9 
individuals had any waiting time to enroll in classes. 



• The BSBP increased service delivery of its vocational rehabilitation program for 
Michigan’s blind citizens by 32% from 2014 and employment outcomes increased by 
11% by combining and streamlining intake and referral processes into one procedure 
when consumers contact the agency. The BSBP provides diagnostic evaluations, 
vocational counseling and training in skills of job development to assist blind individuals 
to live independently and become employed in a career that suits their potential skills. 

Bureau of Construction Codes (BCC) 

• The BCC has switched to a new customer friendly online system for licensing, permitting, 
and inspecting. The BCC is working toward a more streamlined, customer friendly system 
which allows for application and payment online -- for items previously required to be 
mailed. 

• The BCC partnered with CE Broker to provide electrical licensees the ability to track and 
report their continuing education requirements at no cost. This web-based management 
system reduces the amount of time for the bureau to audit licensees, thus providing a 
faster license renewal process. 

• The BCC has assisted DEQ in their efforts with Flint water by identifying and sequencing 
plumbing fixtures at Flint Schools. 

• The BCC has worked with PSI to administer the trade licensing examinations to improve 
the process and facilitate faster licensing. PSI has five locations in Michigan: Gaylord, 
Grand Rapids, Holt, Marquette and Southfield. The electrical licensing examinations were 
implemented November 1, 2015. 

Bureau of Community and Health Systems (BCHS) 

• Under Public Act No. 59 and No. 104 of 2015, the bureau has deregulated clinical 
laboratories and psychiatric partial hospitalization programs from state licensure, as 
comparable federal oversight is already being performed and state regulatory oversight 
had little value added impact respectively. Moreover, these acts reduce the regulatory 
burden on compliant licensed providers and allows the department to shift resources to 
areas of greater need, such as complaint investigations. 

• The bureau started the integration of licensing services for child care centers and homes, 
adult foster care homes, Homes for the Aged, and adult foster care and child care camps 
from the former Department of Human Services, as set forth in Executive Order (EO) No. 
2015-4. As a result of this EO, the BCHS was formed in July 2015. The new bureau 
centralizes state licensing and federal certification functions for facilities, agencies and 
programs in the state of Michigan. 

Bureau of Professional Licensing (BPL) 

• The BPL Enforcement Division Merged the Public Health Code and Occupational Code 
enforcement processes to create efficiencies and reduce enforcement processing times, 



Licensing Division successfully merged the licensing processes for health and 
commercial professions under the new umbrella of the BPL. 

• The BPL has made improvements to MAPS reports for better utilization by MSP and the 
AG. 


Corporations, Securities and Commercial Licensing (CSCL) 

• The Securities and Audit Section conducted free seminars to educate entrepreneurs and 
others on the options available for raising capital in Michigan and other topics vital to the 
success of new businesses. Approximately 220 people attended each of the first two 
seminars held in Lansing and Dearborn. Additional seminars will be held in Troy, Grand 
Rapids and Marquette in 2016. 

• The Corporations Division continued to promote the use of its online filing system by 
including instructional inserts in all mailings and prominently highlighting that option on all 
forms. When comparing the first six weeks of fiscal year 2014/15 with the same period in 
fiscal year 2015/16, the use of the online renewal of assumed name application 
increased by 72% and the use of FILEONLINE for submission of annual reports 
increased by 127%. 

• Online distance education became much improved when Michigan was approved by the 
Executive Committee of the Midwestern Higher Education Compact (MHEC) as the 10 th 
state to join the Midwestern State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (M-SARA) in 
August 2015. The SARA initiative improves online distance education that benefits 
Michigan residents and the state’s postsecondary institutions. 

Bureau Employment Relations (BER) 

• The Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) along with the Bureau of 
Employment Relations held their most recent training of MERC's panels of Act 312 
Arbitrators and Fact Finders. Act 312 provides for compulsory binding arbitration of labor- 
management disputes involving public police or fire department employees. Fact Finding 
is the final impasse resolution procedure available to employees within MERC's 
jurisdiction who are not eligible for Act 312 arbitration.

S nyder to state workers: Tell us how to 

fix it 

JiStii A, Win? , Lansing State Journal 56 a.m. EDI August 24, 20J5 

LANSING - Many efforts to seek state workers' ideas have died on the vine in the 30 
years R Cole Bouck spent working his way up from corrections officer to the central 
office. 

But a new push by Gov. Rick Snyder and his Office of Good Government seems 
different, the Michigan Department of Corrections process improvement specialist said. 

Take, for example, the Office of Effective Process Improvement & Communication where 

he works, created last year specifically to make the department work better. You could 
call that bureaucratic lip service if the department hadn't already acted on employee 
ideas to modernize electronic monitoring and implement videoconferencing to trim costly 
and dangerous prisoner transports, he said. 

"They're trying very hard to find a way to make sure that it's embedded deep enough in 
government so that whatever it may be called or whoever comes next, it just becomes 
how we do it," Brouck told the State Journal last week. 

After four years of measurement, test runs and one-offs, the Office of Good Government 
is this year launching a statewide, "holistic examination" of where government fails and 
how to fix it, said Mike Zimmer, director of the state Department of Licensing & 
Regulatory Affairs, which houses the Office of Good Government. He said it's an effort 
"completely dependent" on the ideas, engagement and satisfaction of state employees, 
some 14,000 of whom live and work in Greater Lansing. 

That could be a climb. 

Many state employee union officials say morale's at an all-time low, with employees 
beset by a shrinking government workforce, policies such as right-to-work and higher 
pension contributions, and a dimming public view of civil servants. State employee 
surveys show optimism on the rise, but still below other industries. 

Zimmer conceded employees express antagonistic, "we've heard that before"-type 
sentiments, but he said ongoing engagement will push the numbers higher. 

By Aug, 31 , each state department must nominate at least three efficiency projects they 
hope to tackle in the coming months — with a lofty goal of halving processing time for 
government services. Zimmer's office will support the efforts, monitor progress and 
communicate with Michiganders though a new website, Michigan. gov/OGG. 



"You almost have to tap into employee frustration and show them, 'We are listening,"' he 
said. 

Success 

Making government go twice as fast is "very scary," Zimmer said, but it's already 
happened. 

Thanks to new technology, "sometimes we’re talking about instantaneously versus eight, 
10 days in processing times," LARA spokesman Jason Moon said. "People sometimes 
were driving to Lansing from out of state to get a permit or license because they wanted 
to start their business. Well, now it's online." 

The new good government website is full of success stories: Liquor licenses are 
processed 176 days sooner, corporate filings 45 days faster. 

There's a place online where state workers can sign up as "Bureaucracy Busters" and 
tales of the already-busted: Work is afoot to trim the number of passwords employees 
need to access various systems. Meal receipts are no longer required with 
reimbursement requests. New, leaner timekeeping and expense-tracking softwareshouJd 

launch Oct. 1, 2016. 

Previously unavailable technology helps, Zimmer said, but in some areas state 
government is just poorly designed. The Office of Good Government works hand-in-glove 
with LARA's Office of Regulatory Reinvention, which aims to cut rules and laws requiring 
state employees to take extraneous steps. 

Zimmer, himself a 30-year veteran of government, said past efficiency and engagement 
efforts happened "in fits and starts and different silos within the departments," but "the 
message that Gov. Snyder has advanced in this is to do it holistically." 

Skepticism 

A holistic solution might be necessary for a holistic problem: More than $1 million a year 
spent on meetings for more than 200 state boards. More than a quarter of the Auditor 
General's recommendations each year repeated from previous audits because problems 
go unfixed. Hundreds of work-hours spent compiling more than 1 ,100 legislative reports, 
including some on programs that no longer exist. 

Zimmer said that's why employee engagement will be key. 

"I always say, within my department, my knowledge base is 10 miles wide and an inch 
deep," the director said, "It requires the employees — especially the online, frontline 
employees who do this stuff every day — to identify where the redundancies are, where 
the inconsistencies are, where things just don't make sense." 



Union officials support employee surveys and other engagement efforts. And some 
remain optimistic: "We're always looking for opportunities to build something positive 
between us," Andy Potter, chief of staff for the Michigan Corrections Organization, said. 

But deep cynicism remains, 

Ed McNeil, civil service director for the American Federation of State, County & Municipal 
Employees, said unions years ago negotiated an employee feedback mechanism into 
contract language. But he said the state's hasn't responded to concerns about top-heavy 
departments, the hidden costs of problem contracts, or other issues. 

"We've been fighting this battle all along," McNeil said. 

But Zimmer said his office is ready to win employees over and quell skepticism, largely 
through communication: "Yes, this is about efficiency. Yes, this is about effectiveness. 

No, this is not an end-goal to reduce employment because we know that there's enough 
work out there that we can spread the work out in a more effective way." 

While, in the past, employee suggestions might gather dust in a manager's inbox, 
managers will now be held accountable for follow-through, he said. While other initiatives 
petered out, his goal is to ingrain the new process so deeply and talk so loudly about its 
successes that it would be politically dangerous for future administrations to unravel it. 

To employees, "I think it's something we just have to prove overtime," Zimmer said. "At 
some point, you just have to walk the walk."

LANSING - Michigan state employees are more engaged with and optimistic about their 
jobs than in past years, but remain more pessimistic than employees in other industries. 

Sixty-one percent of state-government workers said their departments encourage 
innovation, support teamwork and openly communicate, among other positive attributes, 
according to the results of thelatest state employee survey by the 
firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). 

That's up from 60% in the previous survey in 2013 and 58% in a 2012 survey. 

But that's still less than the 69% of employees in other professional and service industries 
and 74% in high-performing industries such as manufacturing and health care, according 




to the PWC report finalized this month,. The report said surveys of other government 
workforces are too rare for a comparison. 

Communication was one of the state's most-improved areas over 201 3, the survey found, 
with a 5-point increase in the percent of employees who agreed department leaders are 
open and honest with them. Still, only 46% of employees said so this year. 

The state saw declines in the share of employees who said diverse opinions are valued 
and in the share who said their departments made strides in customer service, 

"I think the numbers tell us that (Gov. Rick Snyder's) administration is on the right track," 
said Mike Zimmer, director of the state Office of Good Government, which manages the 
survey. "They're trending up. We've got some work to do." 

Zimmer said his office "drill(s) down into the scores to see what the employees are 
asking for" and has used the results from past surveys to launch programs offering 
employees leadership development, education and other engagement opportunities.

"Whenever you reach out to the front-line staff and to their union, you're going to improve 
quality and job performance and job satisfaction," said Ray Holman, legislative liaison for 
the United Auto Workers Local 6000, the largest state-worker union, "The positive trend 
is a good thing. It needs to be better, though." 


He said the state couid get more positive engagement if it involved unions more often 
because employees feel freer to offer constructive criticism with the union involved. 

The report said leadership and communications were important to employees. While both 
have improved recently, departments "could be more consistent to have more significant 
impact," the report said. 

Unsurprisingly, employees cited a lack of staff as a hindrance to their productivity. The 
state workforce is the smallest it's been in decades and state-worker unions have 
clamored for more front-line employees. 

The strongest optimism in this year's survey came out of the governor's office, where 
82% agreed with positive statements about their jobs, followed by the Michigan State 
Police at 79%. 

The least optimism came from the Michigan Department of Corrections, where only half 
of the employees were optimistic, and the departments of Civil Rights and Human 
Services, where just more than half were optimistic. 

Civil Rights is the smallest department outside the governor's office, and Corrections and 
Human Services have faced numerous problems in recent months. 

There’s been a stark shortage of corrections officers at state prisons and the 
department's struggled with a scandal-plagued privatized prison food contract, A glitch- 
ridden computer program made work difficult in Human Services. That department also 
recently merged with the state Department of Community Health, where 61% of 
employees answered positively about their work. 

Nearly 32,000 state workers, or 71%, took the online survey throughout the month of 
March, the highest participation of the three surveys. The Attorney General and 
Secretary of State offices didn't participate. 

The survey cost the state $272,000 this year, but $250,000 of that was covered by a 
W.K. Kellogg Foundation grant and the remainder was covered by the Michigan 
Economic Development Corp. corporate fund, Zimmer said. No general fund dollars were 
used. Zimmer said the state hopes to continue the surveys.

CRAIN'S DETROIT BUSINESS 





Survey: Companies have sunnier views 
of Michigan's business climate

LANSING — Nearly two-thirds of the companies that operate in Michigan say the state 
has a positive business climate and they would be likely to promote Michigan to friends 
or co-workers as a place to start a business, according to a new state survey released 
today. 


The survey shows companies overall are more positive about Michigan’s business and 
regulatory climates than when the state conducted a similar poll for the first time in July 
2013. 


State leaders say increased optimism is evidence Michigan is taking the right steps, 
including reforming business taxes, to encourage companies to do business in the 
state. 


Their goal: To improve the interaction between business and government by speeding 
up processing times, getting rid of some required forms and moving more services 
online. 


“We want people to be able to move as fast as they can on the economic activities that 
they wish to engage in,” Lt. Gov. Brian Calley told Crain’s this week. “This is taking 
unproductive time and giving it back to the customer.” 

The Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development commissioned the 
survey, conducted by Ann Arbor-based ForeSee. In all, 519 companies were polled 
over a month last winter about their perception of Michigan’s regulatory climate. 

Questions tried to gauge businesses’ interactions with the departments 

of Treasury, Environmental Quality and Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, which 
manage roughly two-thirds of all corporate regulations in Michigan. 

Among the findings: 


• Sixty-four percent of respondents have a positive perception of Michigan’s 
business climate and would refer friends and colleagues to the state to open 
businesses. That’s a 10 percentage point increase from the baseline set in July 
2013. 

• Slightly more than half of the respondents — 52 percent and 54 percent, 
respectively — say their interactions with the three state departments surveyed 
improved their perception of Michigan as a whole and rate highly the state’s 
regulatory environment. Both results improved from July 2013. 


• Fifty-seven percent of respondents say they trust Treasury, DEQ and LARA, up 
13 percentage points from July 2013 and the biggest gain in the poll. 

Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration has eliminated the Michigan Business Tax, replacing 
it with a 6 percent corporate income tax, as well as the personal property tax. 

The state also has eliminated more than 1 ,900 administrative rules out of a total of 
17,000 statewide, said LARA Director Mike Zimmer. They include a DEQ wastewater 
report that isn’t used in regulations and a rule requiring child care workers to smile, 
LARA said. 

LARA said it also has shed more than 1 ,400 forms it once used — a 62 percent cut in 
the department’s paperwork. 

“Our customers are happy because (they) don’t have to fill it out,” Calley said. “We can 
act faster because we don’t have to process so much paper.” 

ForeSee conducted the survey between Feb. 24 and March 22. In all, 1,466 business 
leaders opened surveys and 519 returned them, for a response rate of 35 percent. 

Of respondents, 45 percent worked in manufacturing, 59 percent worked for companies 
with 100 or fewer employees and 10 percent worked for professional, scientific or 
technical companies, the state said.

Companies fined over worker 
death as MIOSHA works to 
protect Michigan employees

LANSING, Ml — In June, a 40-year-old master electrician was working to 
construct a trucking warehouse facility in Holland when he was electrocuted 
by a 480-volt electric conductor. 

It's incidents like this where the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration steps in, part of its continuous balancing act of issuing fines 
and trying to build relationships with businesses at the same time. 

in the worker death incident, Hamilton-based Gates Electric Inc. was issued 
$287,000 worth of fines for not complying with electrical code, allowing the 
employee to be in the vicinity of live wires without proper precautions and 
issuing expired safety equipment. Holland-based Electrical Inspection 
Service, LLC, the controlling employer for the work operation, was issued a 
$70,000 fine in connection with the incident as well for not following the 
National Electric Code. 

It may sound like bureaucrat-speak, but these regulations are what aim to 
keep all Michigan workers safe. All those bureaucratic rules are supposed to 
prevent worker deaths. This year 25 workers have died on the job. 

"They're just not numbers, those are people going home at the end of the 
day," said MIOSHA Director Martha Yoder. 

That was the focus of at least one ad the agency put out this year, 
encouraging worker safety to make sure that there weren't any empty seats 
at the dinner table. 

MIOSHA has been around for 40 years, and since 1999 has seen a 57 
percent decline in worker deaths. The agency relies heavily on feedback 
from businesses and is taking steps to make sure businesses see them as a 
resource. They've formed alliances in high-risk industries like construction. 
This year they gave out matching grants for new safety equipment. And 
they've trained inspectors to make sure the end goal is improvement, not 
punishment. 

"We also ask our folks to kind of step away from that traditional enforcement 
model and be more collaborative in the work that they do," Yoder said. 

"Even if it's a MIOSHA compliance officer now that comes out they're going 
to spend time telling you what you're doing well, complimenting you on 
those things, giving you ideas." 



The agency also just launched a YouTube channel where it plans to feature 
best practices directly from business owners. 


But it still runs into businesses who don't properly protect their workers. Also 
this week the agency fined Detroit-based DMC Consultants, Inc. for 
improper practices for asbestos abatement in projects it was working on in 
Ypsilanti. The company got $1 10,600 in fines for not monitoring exposure or 
using appropriate hazard control methods. 

Yoder said that the process involves talking with the companies and 
possible adjusting some fees. They're intended to both motivate compliance 
and demonstrate to other employers that there are consequences if 
regulations aren't filed. The money doesn't go to MIOSHA directly, but back 
into the state's general fund. 

Yoder said MIOSHA has made great strides recently but has room for 

improvement. 

"57 percent reduction? That's great. We always say we would like it to be 
zero. We would like at the end of the year to have no names on our fatality 
log in Michigan. And we know it's possible," Yoder said. 

2013 data has Michigan ranked 26th among states for worker deaths, tying 
the national average rate. 


Michigan Workers' Comp pure 
premiums drop second most in 
nation since 2011 


By Emily Lawler | elawler@mlive.com

LANSING, Ml -- Michigan employers could save money following another 
downward revision of the Workers' Compensation pure premium, the 
Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs announced Tuesday. 




The pure premium reflects statewide loss adjustment expenses and is 
ultimately used by insurers to set their rates. It's the portion of an employer’s 
insurance premium that pays for claims costs for work-related injuries. It will 
drop 6.9 percent in 2016. 

In 2015, the pure premium dropped by 6.5 percent. Since 201 1 , when the 
state made changes to workers' compensation, premiums have dropped by 
32.7 percent and saved employers $327 million. Over the 2011-2015 period 
Michigan's premiums have dropped the second most nationally, while the 
national average has climbed by 11.3 percent. 

"By continuing to reduce unnecessary costs, the system has become an 
important economic asset," said Gov. Rick Snyder in a statement. "These 
considerable business savings can free up capital and allow companies to 
hire more workers, increase salaries and expand operations." 

Workers' Compensation Agency Director Mark Long said the agency had 
taken steps to implement efficient practices and make sure all required 
forms and processes were related to actual statute. In other words, the 
statutory and regulatory controls are perfectly aligned. 

"It really is an overall approach to the workers' compensation system," Long 
said. 

He said any savings on the premiums employers are then free to put back 
into wages or expansions. 

LARA spokesperson Jason Moon said the declining premiums were also an 
economic asset to attract businesses to Michigan.

- Mike 


Governor, 

Included in this briefing are the first draft of speech mentions (from Corey) and an updated draft of the outline which 
includes changes outlined below. 

Are there any particular areas you would like us to provide in-depth briefings or white papers on over the next few weeks? 
We will have a spreadsheet with 2015 success statistics after Christmas -- there are some stats that aren't available until 
then. Steve Arwood is working next week on providing info re: 2016 economic development proposals. 

Changes in this version of the outline include:

Mike I am sorry to do this, but please use this updated timeline on the Flint water issue instead of the one I sent earlier 

today. Unfortunately the earlier version did not have some additional detail regarding some of our public messaging on 
this issue. This should be reflected in this new version. 


Thanks.

Subject: RE: State of the State update 

Mike-— Tim and I have worked to come up with some additional information for you on our topics. Attached you will 
find: 

1. Document, titled 'Timeline 12 29 15" that, will give you the timeline of the Flint Water situation from MDHHS. 

2 . Document titled "MDHHS ISD Overview" that will give you additional Integrated Service Delivery detail from 
item B in your outline. 

3. Document titled "Opportunities for Improved Outcomes for Families" that will give you additional information 
for items A.l and A.3 

We still need to work a bit more on item A. 2. from the outline so we will see what we can get to you after the first of the 
year. 

Please let us know if this is helpful and what additional information you may need. 

Thanks-g

Subject: State of the State update 

Nick, 

Geralyn provided some great info to help me put together the Quality of Life section of the governor's state of the state 
address (pasted below). 

The governor is generally happy with how it's laid out, but he says it needs additional detail and some further work / 
development. He also noted that the integrated service delivery section will depend on budget issues and hopes that 
makes the cut, but I think he will want additional detail there, as well. (Detail in this case means more info in the outline, 
but also supporting briefs and other documents on the proposals). 

This is well outside of my wheelhouse, so I'm hoping you can provide some assistance on this. I'm sending the governor 
another update on the state of the state outline at the end of the day tomorrow, then will be providing him additional 
materials next week (and after the New Year, of course). 

I'm available to talk tomorrow if you want to catch up then. 

Thanks, 

Mike

Yes - a letter may be nice and if John does want to speak, he could read the letter aloud if Eric prefers. Let me know!

Thanks for checking into this, Sarah. Would a letter be something that could be read and just be congratulatory in 
nature? I can check with Eric to see if this would be helpful or maybe even Walsh to come and speak. 

Thanks,

Hi Claire, 

The governor has commitments with Auto Show in Detroit on this day. I was going to see if the LG was available, but he 
has the same conflicts as the governor on the 12th. What's your recommendation moving forward with this one? We can 
certainly provide a letter if appropriate (I'm not sure if they're doing a program of some sort?) 

Let me know what you think - thank you!

Hi Sarah, 

Below is information, as requested on your scheduling form for an event request for the Governor. If you need me to put 
it in the actual document, I am happy to do so. 

Eric Scorsone has been incredibly helpful to the Strategy team over the last five years. In the last four months he has 
been extremely important member on our pensions workgroup and in gathering the data on the pension and OPEB 
situation in Michigan. If there is a chance the Governor has the availability to attend this event, that would be great. 

If you have any questions or need any additional information, please let me know. 

Thanks! 

Claire

Claire, 

Here is the information for the event. 

Date of Event: Tuesday January 12th, 2016 
Location: MSU Kellogg Center, Red Cedar Room 

219 S. Harrison Rd. East Lansing, Ml 48824 (Ingham County) 4:00pm to 6:00pm 

Name: Kickoff Event for MSU Center for Local Government Finance and Policy Contact Name: Dr. Eric Scorsone Host 

Organization: Michigan State University Extension 

90 Agriculture Hall 

Michigan State university 

East Lansing, Ml 48824-103 

517-353-9460 

Scorsone@msu.edu 

Yes for Media 

Number of Attendees: 100 

Event Purpose: to launch the new Center for Local Government Finance and Policy at Michigan State University Governor 
Role: Speaking 

Agenda: 4pm Event starts (light horderves and beer/wine) 

4:45pm Remarks 
6pm Event Ends 

Background: The creation of the Center is building on the long time work of MSU Extension in the area of local 
government finance and policy over the past fifty years. This work has included historically new county commissioner 
training, new legislative leadership training and budget and finance training for local governments. More recently, MSU 
extension has worked in policy development with the Governors Office on activities such as Emergency Manager

training, EVIP and revenue sharing, and pension and OPEB analysis and work with the Flint water task force. We are 
seeking to celebrate the new center and MSlPs ongoing investment to support research, education and outreach for 
local governments and the state government to foster healthy local governments in Michigan. We are hoping the 
governor will make some brief remarks regarding the relationship that has been developed with the state government 
and MSU Extension in providing assistance on state-local policy issues and that the center cements and builds long term 
institutional capacity to continue this work. 

Governor has not spoken to this group 

Thanks so much 

Eric

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on November 
1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 
The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly advise 
the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The city paid 
the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 


www.michigan.gov/treasury 


































2 


Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, and 
began on September 29, 2015. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 1 1, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four- month plan listing the priorities to be 
accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- S700K, and Culture and Recreation- S600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

- Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

- Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates remain 
conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will formally update 
revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year financial plan. 

As die city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in October 
2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change orders. 
The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to tire FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed session 
at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending contract. 

Significant Action/Issues 

The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. The 
report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 



3 


The city’ s four- year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the second 
year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its base year 
with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 17 - FY 20 
budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the first budget 
since the EM's departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and will be subject 
to FRC review and approval. 

At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the Michigan 
Financial Review Commission Act. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 2017. 
Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’ s corporate 
city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 2017. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under PA 
72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM was 
operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 claiming it 
was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the tests necessary 
to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position of 
City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1, 2015. $11 .21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 
in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the final 
copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has been trying 
to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these developments. 

The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1 , 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 



4 


Significant Actions/Issues 

At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four- year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs in 
Year 1. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court-ordered 
mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 meeting. 
The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

- The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

- Benton Harbor is hiring the MML to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Lansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Labor in 2014 of a wage claim filed 
with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety Collective 
Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. Department 
of Labor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the settlement: 1) 
correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from the inception of 
the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission approved the settlement at 
its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the settlement on August 11, 2015. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be sent 
to die RTAB for review. 

Lormer Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 



5 


RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was inaccurate, 
according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and financial plan 
and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire service costs, 
which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance the 
budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griff ea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a previous 
35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This injunction also 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund, prevents the 
city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from disconnecting water service for 
nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction could potentially cost the General 
Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have not been successful. Most recently, 
Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a class action. 

As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
S1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed an 
appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal because 
the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back to Genesee 
County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is discussing the need 
for additional legal representation with the city.

Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’ s water system after a study 
by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard testing 
shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be adding a 
corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead leaching into 
the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality testing to 
residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case {Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 0.6 
mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must maintain 
adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax Commission Rules, 
and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the city shall implement 
a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the State Tax Commission. The 
city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

- The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation of 
the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the installation 
of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance with the 
federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a 
leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is approximately 1/3 
complete.

for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into sanitary 
sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 15, 2015 
and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 2015 and 
will be completed next summer.

for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget.

denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme Court. 
The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. The 
lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’ s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the overfunded 
portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the supervision of 
Eugene Driker.

addressing our most difficult challenges with Relentless Positive Action. 

Together ; we have come a long way over the last five years, but there is still more to accomplish . 


CREATING JOBS 

» Created more than 420,000 private sector jobs since 201 1 . 

» Lowest unemployment rate in 14 years. 

» September 2015 marked the first month since August 2000 that Michigan's jobless rate 
was below the national rate. 

» Michigan ranks No, 1 in automotive jobs and No. 5 in overall job creation. 

» Launched the Rising Tide initiative, providing economically challenged communities with 
tools to design and build a successful economic framework. 

o vs su as s o 
rUUIMui UUli 

» Secured a long-term, comprehensive, sustainable solution to improve Michigan roads. 

» The single largest investment in Michigan's roads over the last half century, providing an 
additional $1.2 billion over the next five years to improve road conditions. 

» The plan ensures room for smart economic growth while continuing to invest in core 
priorities like education and our local communities. 

BALANCING OUR BUDGET 

» Michigan is five for five in getting balanced budgets done months ahead of the deadline. 

» Ranked first nationally in Index of State Budget Process Quality, and second for most 
improved credit rating. 

» The Rainy Day Fund will increase to $565 million at the end of FY201 6 after being at $2 
million in 2010, 






RIVER OF OPPORTUNITY 

» Restructured state government to put people first and help them succeed. 

» Created the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to eliminate silos in 
state government and better serve our valued customers. 

» Expanded Pathways to Potential into nine additional counties in 20 new schools and 
reduced chronic absenteeism by 37 percent in the 21 9 Pathways schools.

Agency to close the skills gap and prepare talent for the highly skilled, technical jobs of 
today and tomorrow. 

» Invested $85 million for skilled trades to develop a skilled workforce to support career and 
technical education and early/middle college programs. This allows students to earn a 
high school diploma, an associate's degree, technical certification, or up to 60 college 
credits through dual enrollment; skilled trades training and equipment programs, and 
increased funding for vocational education programs.

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 











































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

tools to design and build a successful economic framework. 


Secured a long-term, comprehensive, sustainable solution to improve Michigan roads. 
The single largest investment in Michigan's roads over the last half century, providing an 
additional $1,2 billion over the next five years to improve road conditions. 

The plan ensures room for smart economic growth while continuing to invest in core

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

package that changes how Michigan’s youths are tried, sentenced and incarcerated, 
o “Medical parole” - licensed care facility for frail, terminally-ill inmates - recent testimony in 
House committee. 

o Medical marijuana - Passed House, stalled in Senate. 

o Aramark >T rinity transition - Trinity in all facilities statewide as of Sept. 9. Had a “grace 
period” for violations that ended on Nov. 14, six months after initial contract started. 

Audit report on Aramark violations was released on Dec. 4. 
o Diversity in law enforcement - Lawsuit filed in Wayne Co. 1 2/8/1 5 alleging discriminatory 
hiring practices. MSP is working to establish an explorer/cadet program for minority 
youth, ages 14-20, who live in a Secure Cities Partnership area.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 

































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 



■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required 

■ We wanted local communities to be able to address the unique challenges of their 
cities 

■ Our operations manual stated that bidding and contracting were the sole 
responsibility of our blight partners in each community 

■ U.S. Treasury approved that approach 

Where we are today 

■ We are in the process of reviewing requested documents from the Detroit Land 
Bank 

■ We are mindful that with any pilot there is the possibility that best practice is 
achieved by learning from experience 

■ Based on recent news reports and our review of Detroit's program, it has been 
demonstrated there is a need for greater clarity on how to manage the contracting 
and change order processes 

■ This is an opportunity for the state to take a leadership role in filling this gap 

■ Earlier this fall MSHDA started taking steps to do just that by reviewing blight 
partner programs in these areas and to strengthen the operations manual by 
providing additional oversight 

■ A new section was added to our blight ops manual regarding procurement bid 
package audits 

o All bid packs will be analyzed by a MSHDA/Hardest Hit Fund team, on a 
consistent and continual basis. They will: 

■ Pull all bid packs 

■ Take random sample of contractors that did not have the lowest bid 
but won the award 

■ Take 100 percent sample of contractors that did not have the 
lowest bid but won the award 

■ Review posting process to acquire bids 

■ Perform review and analysis on change orders for contractors that 
received winning ward 

■ MSHDA is considering other possible policy changes in the new year 

■ If any of our reviews turn up any issues, we will take appropriate action 


Points of pride 


■ This demolition program has been a great value for Michigan 

o To date, we have provided nearly $106 million in assistance to combat 
blight in 16 Michigan cities and demolished 7,125 abandoned blighted 
structures. 

o According to a Michigan State University Land Policy Institute study, 
declining foreclosure and tax foreclosure rates are being seen in Flint, 
Hamtramck, Lansing, Pontiac, River Rouge and Saginaw. 



o It also has proven effective in reducing violent crime and raising property 
values in some communities. 

o Demolition projects are restoring pride in neighborhoods and laying the 
groundwork for future economic success by making communities safer and 
better places to live, work, play and invest. 



Things accomplished by the administration 

• Brought together legislators in a bi-partisan early literacy workgroup. 

• Held the Governor's Economic and Education Summit to bring together education and business 
leaders to make Michigan the #1 state for talent in the nation. 

• Held the first-ever higher education summit with university presidents and trustees. 

• Introduced a proposal to finally turn around Detroit schools. 

• School Reform Office executive order (probably not something we'd tout publicly, though). 

Things accomplished by other actors 

• Passage of new science standards for Michigan 

• Hiring of a new state superintendent 

• Expansion of the Detroit Promise Scholarship 

Things accomplished by partnerships with others 

• Created and funded - to the tune of $30M - a robust early literacy policy. 

• Passage of a teacher evaluation system. 

• Creation of the MiSTEM Advisory Council. 

• Increased per-pupil funding by $70-$140 per pupil. 

• Increased funding to districts serving at-risk students by $70M. 

• Expanded CTE and early/middle colleges. 

• Created an early warning system for school district finances. 

• Allowed for personal finance classes to meet the requirement for economics credit. 

• Removed the fee cap on the teacher certification test, allowing for more robust and credible 
examinations for teachers looking to go into the classroom. 

• Reduced the number of districts in financial deficit. 


F o r w a r d -- T hinkin e Goal s 


• Make Michigan the #1 state for talent. 

• Continue the work on literacy (we might do an executive order creating a commission to look at 
literacy, but timing is not certain yet). 

• Raise the accountability bar for all schools. 

• Put Detroit schools on the path to academic and financial success. 

• Make higher education more accessible and successful for students.

2015 MDOC accomplishment highlights: 

• Hired nearly 1 ,000 new corrections officers and reinstated training academy. 

• Began new oncology clinic and hospice program at Duane Waters Health Center in 
Jackson. 

o Oncology unit reduces need for offsite care for cancer patients and results in 
cost-savings. 

o Prisoners will be trained to support their terminally-ill peers, terminally-ill patients 
will receive additional emotional support to end their lives with some degree of 
dignity. 

• Re-entry efforts focused on vocational training. 

o Virtual welding simulators at Muskegon and Kinross facilities - safer and less 
costly, also train students more quickly to meet highly-marketable and in-demand 
skills. 

o Handlon Facility added 2 new instructors in welding and CNC machine programs, 
bringing total capacity for instructional programs from 1 5 seats to 1 20. 

o Handlon also restored auto mechanics program which was idle since June of 
2012. Enrollment will total 30 students. 

• Mobilizing field agents 

o 1 ,1 00 parole and probation agents have been equipped with mobile technology - 
iPhone 6+ and a mobile application of the case management system (OMNI), 
enabling agents to be more responsive to the offenders on their caseload and 
less constrained by traditional geographic boundaries. 

o The technology allows agents to access more of the information they need in the 
field to protect the public. This allows agents to spend more time in the 
communities and neighborhoods they serve rather than spending time in an 
office tied to their desktop computer. In addition, the mobile app allows, for the 
first time ever, agents to input information into the department's case 
management system with they are in the field; thereby maximizing their time and 
making them far more efficient. 


Secure Cities data (Oct. 2015): 

































Presumptive Parole talking points: 

• Evidence-based parole, also known as presumptive parole, means that once an offender 
has served their minimum sentence as mandated by a judge, they will be eligible for 
release. 

• Eligibility for evidence-based parole is based on a number of factors that show the offender 
has a “high probability of success,” including behavior in prison, completion of degrees 
and other employability skills. 

• Unless the parole board has a substantial and compelling reason to ask that the offender 
stays imprisoned, they will be prepared for release. 

• However, what is substantial and compelling is not clearly defined. Without the structure 
that guidelines provide, decisions on similar cases will not always be consistent. 

• Members of the parole board will react to certain crimes or certain offenders differently; 
the same person will react differently over time. Guidelines help ensure that similar cases 
are treated the same and have similar outcomes. 

• Knowing a likely parole date is important as it helps the Department of Corrections with a 
timeline to prepare an offender to leave prison, such as ensuring they have ID cards, a 
resume, and employment recommendations. 

• Overall, guidelines will ensure the entire corrections system works to the maximum level 
of efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness. 

• House Bill 4138 will save $75 million in corrections costs for Michigan over the next five 
years. It will also reduce the prison population by 3,200 people. These aggregate savings 
at the state level result from the accumulation of relatively small impacts on counties. 

• This could be a hugely missed opportunity to reinvest a substantial sum of taxpayer money 
to fund other essential services and improve the quality of life in Michigan. 



Energy Update: 


Current status of legislation, high level: We expect a vote in the House by the end of the year, and you 
praised the package (noting its bi-partisan nature) that passed committee as well as the work the Senate 
has been doing. We do not expect the full Senate to vote before the end of the year, but many fruitful 
discussions are going on. We are optimistic the whole package will make it to your desk early in the 
year. 

• If asked: the media has finally figured out that the 30% goal by 2025 language from your 
energy message that made it into legislation doesn't actually involve building any more 
renewables. (30% = 9% renewables we already have + 6% energy waste reductions we 
have already done + 15% additional waste reduction). Therefore, you may get asked 
about this. You can reiterate that you think that based on economics alone, you would 
expect between 30-40% of Michigan's energy to come from a combination of energy 
waste reduction and renewables. Therefore, while you support the goal, economics 
alone will likely end up having us exceed that. 

• If asked re the economics of energy waste reduction: the energy waste reduction we 
have already done has saved us approximately $4.2B from a combined expenditure of a 
little over $1B, meaning we are enjoying more than $3B of savings since 2009. Our 
most recent programs are even more cost-effective than prior years, pointing to just 
how much more we have to save. (Just for context, we spent more than $24B on coal 
and natural gas in the time frame we saved $4.2B of mostly fuel costs.) 

Clean Power Plan/carbon rule, high level: We had overwhelming stakeholder support from across the 
spectrum for your decision to develop a state carbon implementation plan in order to comply with the 
"Clean Power Plan" the President announced (Republicans call it the "carbon rule"). Because having 
everyone from the MEC and the League of Conservation Voters to the Michigan Manufacturer's 
Association to every owner of a coal plant in the state actually agree on you doing something isn't a 
media story, the coverage focused almost entirely on your decision not to sue the EPA but Schuette's 
decision to do so. If asked, we recommend downplaying any conflict with the AG and noting Schuette 
has said he is optimistic about the plan your administration is developing. The stakeholder process will 
be announced before the end of the year. 

• If after Dec. 14, we will have announced the stakeholder process and released our initial 
modelling results. Those show that Michigan may not have to do anything at all to comply with 
the carbon rule for at least a decade (beyond what we are already planning to do in terms of 
plant retirements, and maintaining our levels of waste reduction (1%) and renewables 
(10%)). That will likely be the headline, and will make things awkward for the injunction request 
Schuette is pursuing on the basis that we have to do so much out of the gate we need the court 
to stop this now. 

Other energy items from this year: 

• We continued a multi-year trend of (inflation-adjusted) decreasing costs for industrial electricity 
(very different trend from other states in our region), and landed a number of high-intensity 
users because of that progress (e.g. the particle board facility in Grayling). 

• The MPSC looked five years ahead and found that while we did not face an impending loss of 
power due to a lack of supply, we would switch from being a net exporter of power to an 
importer next year. That will mean we have to rely much more on a volatile market than we 
have in the past, and is one of the reasons we need the energy legislation. 



You created the Michigan Agency for e nergy (MAE) and put out your 2015 energy message . 

You launched the Pipeline Safety Advisory' Board to implement the task force reports. It has 
already begun work. 



Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQwill test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Flint Journal and water stories 


Wanted to give you guys a heads up. The Journal has posted four stories about the water issue today, three of them 
within the hour. Based on my Mlive experience, I can tell you this means A) the stories are getting a lot of hits, and they 
are milking it in an attempt to B) get the stories to go viral. They no doubt remember the attention the Detroit water 
issue got during the summer and are shooting for something similar. Journalism has taken a backseat to clicks. 

I don't know if that changes what we do, but I wanted to give you a heads up to the strategy. Pushing back will give 
them more stories, but we might be able to shift the narrative away from the state.

Hi there Harvey - 

Just following up on this per brief conversation/mention at yesterday's senior staff meeting and Dave's voice mail to you 
as well. 

I believe you had indicated you had a meeting on this tomorrow, yes? 

We need to touch base and get all facts on this situation ASAP. Turning into unfortunate and unnecessary PR issue that 
we're trying to work with Treasury and DEQto be on top of, stem, find resolution, etc. 

Please call our office today to connect with Dave (as our lead on this) or myself or Jarrod if he's not available for some 
reason. 

Thanks much, 

SW

Sorry I missed the meeting. Had a couple conflicts. Here’s what I want to share with you: 


Redacted 


3. Flint Water: had a meeting yesterday with a company Baird put in the room to discuss their 
ozone technology. It was a good conversation but a non-starter for several reasons (Flint 
already has an Ozone system to modify its water, this company hasn’t had its system certified 
for use on public drinking water supplies, and the problem they propose to address is not at 
the water plant but throughout various sections of the distribution system). More broadly, 
Harvey is looking for a ‘thing’ the state can be doing for Flint that will position SOM / RS 
positively. Suggestions range from handing out home water filters (think Britta faucet mount) to 
passing out jugs of water. After consulting with our experts in the Drinking water program, what 
we’ve really come to at DEQ is that if there’s funding from treasury (or some charitable donor 
foundation), the best short-term use of dollars would probably be to hire a company to ‘pig’ the 
lines in the distribution system. This is a routine maintenance activity in municipal systems that 
involves an in-line device under pressure that clears funk out of the lines. The good news on 
Flint : Flint EM Jerry Ambrose noted yesterday that the city has some work to do on its system 
in the weeks ahead; the TTHM issue is quickly going away; the ‘brown water’ folks are loud but 
really few in number; the consultants are doing their work to make suggestions to help the city 
prioritize its needs; and, broadly, nobody seems to be targeting the administration recently.

Not yet, but hopefully will be. Think got Dennis and Harvey on same page about tying in other HHS/Hurley news to part 
of action plan on Friday's announcement. DEQand DHHS teams trying to finalize policy and messaging drafts now for 
review. 1:30 p.m. mtg to walk through details and see where at. 

Also - heads up and FYI - we just had a major protocol and near security breach with WJRT TV 12 getting up to 2nd floor 
without our knowledge or escort. Apparently DK Security and other EO team though they were part of pastors meeting 
happening. (Apparently invited by the pastors). That's caused some excitement have been dealing with. They're on our 
comms floor now - doing a stand up with them and letting them catch pastors after meeting outside.

Via email: ilkeitdersQttfi^ 
and US. Mail 

Ms. Hataslia L. Henderson, City Administrator 

City of Flint 

llll S. Saginaw St. 

Flint, Michigan 48502 

Dear Ms. Henderson: 

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the possibility of reconnecting the City of Flint to the Detroit 
Water and SewerageDepartmenf s (DWSD) Water Supply system .Director McCormick has asked 
me to respond to you and provide a brief outline of the basis for that reconnection:. However, I 
want to again emphasize what Ms. McCormick has previously stated to your City Council on this 
issue: DWSD is willing to sit down and talk with the City of Flint without pre-condition, if that is 
mutually desirable. 

I would be remiss if 1 did not point out that oil June 12, 2015, the City of Detroit and the Great 
Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) executed a Lease Agreement that provides for the GLWA’s 
operation of the Regional Water Supply System. At present, we are transitioning management of 
the system from DWSD to the GLWA while certain Conditions Precedent of the Lease Agreement 
arc satisfied. We have made substantial progress towards satisfying these Cdnditiohs hi^Cedfent 
with a goal of having GLWA commence full system operations on or before January 1, 2016. 1 
can assure you that, like DWSD, the GLWA is concerned with the challenges Id infs residents 
have faced in ; recent months, and will be wi 1 ling to discuss service to your City. 

That said, here is a likely list of issues that would need to be addressed: 

1) Rates : In Sue McCormick’s January 12, 2015 letter to Flint, she indicated that the 
rates Flint would pay for the remainder of the then current 2014-2015 Fiscal Year (FY) 
would he Abe same rates Flint was paying as a terminated customer when it left the 
system but modified to include the 4% increase experienced by all other DWSD 
wholesale customers in 2014.” As we are now in the 2015-16 FY, that offer must be 
modified to include an additional adjustment similar to: that which was received by other 
eusfomers.: In this regard wc propose that the rates be adjusted as follows: 

a) Starting with the 2013-2014 FY terminated rate; and 

b) Adding a 4% adjustment to that rate to account for the 2014-2015 FY1 increasgsi and 

c) Adding ait adjustment equal to the average Suburban Wholesale Charge Adjustment 
for the current 2015-2016 FY. This rate would remain in place until June 30, 2016, the 
end of the : current 2 0 1 5-2016 FY.

Oito oi- nr ; DiRprioi-: 



Ms, Natasha L. Henderson, City Administrator 
City of Flint 
September 30, 2015 

Page 2 - — ^ 


d) Based upon the above considerations, the resulting fate stricture is a fixed monthly 
rate of $662, 1 00 and a commodity rate of $8.93/Mcf for the current 2015-2016 PY. Please 
note that this rate structure is designed to be appiicabie to incremental water sales over and 
above water sales to the Genesee County Drain Commission. Depending on how water is 
provided to the combined GODC/Flint customer, alternative rate structures may be 
appropriate. 

e) Additionally, DWSD recently changed its wholesale customer billing methodology as 
follows: Flint’s calculated share of the FY 2016 Budget is allocated 60% to the Fixed 
Monthly Charge and 40% to the Commodity Charge, which is consistent with the 
adopted FY 2015-2016 water wholesale rates 

f) In extending this; proposal. Our assumption is that the service provided is to Flint only 
and computations are based on data from our previous customer relationship. 

g) It is anticipated that Under; the management: of theGTWA, fe the 2016-2017 

FY will be computed using the same methodology as applied to all other Abater Supply 
System customers. 

The proposed rate methodology i s intended to ensure that Flint is treated fairly by using the average 
wholesale customer adjustment in the current Fiscal Year, and the same methodology as all other 
customers. 

2) Term: DWSD understands that Flint’s current long-term desire is to receive water 
service from the KWA. Under these circumstances, Flint would be expected to remain a 
DWSD customer from the time of reconnection until the time it begins to receive service 
from KWA. If Flint wishes to consider a longer term relationship with DWSD or 
GLWA, we would welcome that discussion. 

3) Reconnection : As previously indicated by Ms. McCormick in her January 12, 2015, 
letter, DWSD Will not charge an additional fee for Flint to reconnect fo the DWSD Water 
System, and is prepared to immediately take those steps necessary on its end to facilitate 
a reconnection. Any expenses incurred would be billed at actual cost. Because DWSD 
lacks sufficient information on the status of the disconnection, we are unable to provide 
an estimate of those costs at this time. Nonetheless^ we will work with you in good faith 
to develop an expedited plan for reconnection, and to develop a mutually agreed .good 
faith esttmate of the costs associated with that plan. 

Thank you for raising this issue with us. We hope that this letter addresses the concerns you. raised 
during jfour recent conversation with Ms. McCormick, and we sincerely appreciate your interest 
and the opportunity to serve Flint.

Finally, we look forward to the opportunity to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss 
this letter, and how we may best assist Flint in serving its residents’ needs. Please contact Ms. 
McCormick’s office at (313) 224-4701 to arrange this meeting.

130210 Resolution/City Council/Mayor Dayne Walling/Request for Appointment of 

Transition Advisory Board 

Resolution resolving that Mayor Dayne Walling and the Flint City Council request 
and recommend to Gov. Rick Snyder that a receivership transition advisory board 
be appointed for the City of Flint under Public Act 436 no later than July 1 , 201 3. 
[NOTE: On December 1 , 201 1 , Gov. Snyder appointed Michael K. Brown as 
Emergency Manager under Public Act 4 for the City of Flint, due in part to a 
consistent deficit in the general fund, the decline in pooled cash, budget issues and 
unfunded liabilities for post-employment benefits. Due to the suspension and 
subsequent repeal of Public Act 4, Gov. Snyder appointed Edward J. Kurtz as 
Emergency Financial Manager under Public Act 72 for the City of Flint, effective 
August 9, 2012. Both the Emergency Manager and the subsequently appointed 
Emergency Financial Manager were authorized by virtue of their appointment to 
“act for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the office of chief 
administrative officer of the City of Flint.” On March 28, 2013, Public Act 436 will 
become effective and provides that an emergency financial manager appointed and 
serving under state law immediately prior to the effective date shall continue to 
serve as an emergency manager under Public Act 436. As an alternative to 
continuation of an emergency manager, and if the financial emergency has been 
rectified, Public Act 436 authorizes the governor to appoint a receivership transition 
advisory board, which serves at the pleasure of the governor and monitors the 
affairs of the local government until the receivership is terminated.]

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

DRAFT (517)241-2112 


MDHHS releases recent data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care , case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued 
preliminary data regarding blood lead levels in Flint children and adults. The department’s 
summary report shows that 30 of 1,361 adults and children tested in Flint since October 1 had 
elevated levels. 


MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to reach out to families 
testing with higher levels and help them reduce their exposure to lead sources. The report is 
intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and provide cumulative 
total numbers. 


“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, 
MDHSS chief medical executive. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those with 
elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with the county 
health department to reach these families. We will update these numbers on a regular basis and 
remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 1,361 children and adults since 
October 1. Twenty-one children age 17 or younger had elevated blood lead levels. Nine adults 
over the age 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of 
elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary 
and venous blood tests that have been reported to MDHHS since the beginning of October. 
People who have had multiple tests are counted only once. The full report is posted online at 
www. michi gan , gov/ flintwater and will be updated as more data becomes available. 

The testing is part of the state’s action plan to address health concerns related to Flint’s water 
infrastructure. 


When reviewing trend data for past years, the third quarter reflects the months during which the 
risk of lead exposure is highest (July through September). From the third quarter of 2010, there 
was a citywide elevated blood lead level in children less than six years of age of 8.3 percent, 
which decreased over the next three years to 4. 1 percent in the third quarter of 2013. In the third 
quarter of 2014, citywide elevated blood lead levels in children less than six years of age 
increased to 7.5 percent, and 6.4 percent in 2015. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, 
increased testing activities began in the city of Flint.

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letters to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
The state provided supplemental funding to support GCHD nursing staff to conduct direct 
outreach to families when an elevated blood lead level has been detected. During these follow-up 
visits, nurses coordinate with environmental health investigators to identify lead exposures, 
address questions and concerns, provide fdters and further information, and meet with families in 
their home environment. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water fdters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations including the MDF1HS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of distribution, visit 

www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 


To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional on the M DHHS YouTube channel . For 
additional updates on Flint water including updates on blood lead levels and testing results, visit

Melanie, 

Are you sure this is your first week in your new role? Good job of putting all of the pieces together - there is a lot 
happening in Detroit and Flint on Friday. I was just talking with Brian to make sure he was all set with what is needed for 
the Flint meeting in the morning in Flint. Harvey Hollins will be on the phone for the water meeting in the afternoon - so 
if I could be copied on the briefing for that meeting it would be great.

I have attached the general Flint update from Treasury. There is a brief paragraph about the water issue, but we are 
looking for a briefing specifically on the water issue. 

The Governor has a meeting in the morning with the Mayor, EM, City Administrator, and President of City Council where 
the water issue may be brought up. However, Col. Etue will also be attending so they will be discussing other topics 
concerning Flint (which is why I have the general update from Treasury). MSP is getting me a general update too. 

Brian Larkin is working on the agenda and a briefing for the couple morning meetings in Flint. 

For the afternoon meeting - we need a briefing on the combined Flint/Detroit water issue. 

Please let me know if you have further questions. 

Thank you, 

Melanie

O.K. I was confused- Bill is working on one for Flint, but can also do one for the Detroit meeting if needed. He is working 
with Brom at Treasury on the Flint briefing. HOWEVER, he thought Wendy may have also requested something from 
Treasury for tomorrow's Detroit meeting since Dennis set it up. Staci do you have anything to add to this?

City Administrator 
Flint, Michigan 


The City of Flint, Michigan has opened the position of City Administrator 
and is now accepting applications. Contained herein is a brief overview 
of Flint as well as the requirements of the position and application 
instructions. 

___________________ Overview 


Flint, Michigan is a mid-sized, mid-western city with an 
economy built on industrial manufacturing, continuing 
education and medical research. The 2010 Census figures 
noted a population of just over 102,000 with an average 
household income of $30,826. Flint is the regional hub of 
Genesee County, containing businesses and colleges 
which employ 33% of county residents and result in a 
daytime population of over 133,000. 

Flint is intersected with three major highways, including US- 
23 and Interstates 69 and 75. Air service and travel is 
provided by Bishop International Airport. The city also contains an extensive railway 
system which includes AmTrak service. Internally, the City consists of 500 miles of road and 1500 
miles of underground water and sewer lines. Flint also owns and operates a water treatment plant 
as well as a wastewater treatment plant. Flint is situated along the river which bears its name and 
currently supplies its water. 




Flint operates under the Strong Mayor 
form of government and has a 
legislative body consisting of nine City 
Council members, each elected by 
and representing the nine City Wards. 

Currently, the City operates on a 
General Fund budget of approximately 
$56,000,000 with a total workforce of

Challenges 

The city, at one time, was one of the largest automotive manufacturing centers in the world. Years of 
decline in the auto industry led to a shrinking economy as well as population loss. The years following 
this decline have left Flint facing a decreasing tax base, increasing operational costs and a 
significantly reduced workforce, 

As a consequence of these factors, coupled with 
decades of ineffective management decisions, Flint 
has been placed into state level financial 
receivership twice within the last 12 years. The 
second episode of receivership began in late 201 1 
is still in effect at this time. Flowever, significant 
progress has been made in addressing the financial 
and institutional deficiencies which have led to the 
City’s challenges. The City has a two-year, balanced budget, it has addressed a significant portion 
of its legacy costs and is in the ongoing process of identifying and correcting structural weaknesses 
within the organization. The City is poised to exit receivership with a much stronger financial position 
and with a more efficient organizational structure, 

The current Emergency Manager convened a 23 member 
Blue Ribbon Committee on governance to identify 
areas and mechanisms within the City government 
which may have led to systemic financial stress. 

Once identified, this committee was tasked with 
developing recommendations on how to address these 
problems, whether through ordinance changes, charter 
amendments or a charter review commission. Chief among the committee’s recommendations was 
a transition to a Council/Manager form of government, in which the day to day operations of 
government would be overseen by the City Manager. 

In addition, the City of Flint has approved and 
adopted its first citywide Master Plan in more than 
50 years. This document represents the input of 
over 5000 residents and community members 
through hundreds of hours of meticulous research 
and compilation. This document will serve as our 
city’s guiding principles for the next five years. The 
plan covers land use, future development and 
economic growth, capital improvement 
investments, housing and neighborhood stability, 
transportation and mobility, open space and parks,

Flint, Michigan 




Flint: Vehicle City 




gL The City of Flint, Michigan was established in 1855 along the 
\ banks of the Flint River. It is known as the Vehicle City. This 

J!|: is a moniker that has its roots in the booming carriage industry 

# of the late 19 th century and not the auto industry of the 20 th 
^ century as many would expect. The name reflects the historical 

willingness of Flint to reinvent itself as it went from lumber town, to 
carriage capital to automobile 
city. That spirit of reinvention is alive today as Flint again 
adapts to the changing climate of business. 

Flint is not only still a significant base for industrial 
manufacturing, but has also grown into a college town as 
well as a hub for medical education and pharmaceutical 

research supported by the city’s engineering, !! 1 


manufacturing and transportation 
infrastructure. “Eds and Meds” are emerging as 
the next important step for Flint’s ever 
diversifying economy. Flint contains two of the 
three hospitals in Genesee County as well as 
an extension of the Michigan State University 
School of Medicine. Additionally, there are 


three major college campuses in Flint, 
including Mott Community College, 

Kettering University (formerly General 
Motors Institute), and the University of 
Michigan-Flint. 

Drawing people into Flint is an ever 

growing lineup of activities and year- • 

round events. Our downtown has many attractive restaurants and shops and is host to some of our 
most popular events. Each summer Flint hosts the Crim Festival of Races, the Back to the Bricks 
car cruise and festival, the Juneteenth Celebration, The Sloan Auto Fair, Shakespeare in the Park 
and the Buckham Alley Fest. In the fall we have our very own Zombie Walk for charity, the Bikes on 
the Bricks festival and in winter we have the Fire and Ice Festival. Furthermore, every second Friday 
of the month is host to our downtown Artwalk. 

Just a few blocks away from downtown is the Flint Cultural Center, a real treasure to the community. 
Located on its grounds are the Flint Institute of Art, the Flint Institute of Music, the Main Branch of 
the Flint Public Library, the Longway Planetarium, Bower Theatre, the Sloan Museum and the Buick 
Automotive Gallery. The Cultural Center also serves as home to the Flint Youth Theatre, Flint School 
of Performing Arts and the Flint Symphony Orchestra.

As requested, the following information has been gleaned from our database regarding violations:

and 910 other violations). 


This represents 326 community water supplies that had violations over these two years. 


Flint has 5 violations in those 2 years (TTHM MCLs at 2 sites and 2 bacti MCLs (1 with E. coli that counts as 
an additional violation)). 


Please let us know if you need anything further. Thank you.

I was hoping we could speak for 30 minutes on the phone next week, ideally before 10am T-F, to get the ball rolling on 
how we may be of service. 

After that, a more in depth conversation on 4/20, 4/24, or the following week in Flint with the relevant parties would be

Looking forward to it!

Re: Email Introduction Per Flarvey Hollins 


Dwar Mayor Walling, 

You and I met a couple years ago at a Michigan Corp event in Flint. Since then, the Greenlark team completed 
a very successful affordability pilot in Flint along with Consumers Energy (late last year). In addition to 
reducing energy costs by 15%, we were able to foster on-time energy bill payments with high levels of 
customer satisfaction. We are now working with another municipality in Michigan (Holland) on energy and 
water affordability issues and in Illinois as well. We would enjoy the opportunity to share the results of our 
Flint energy pilot with you and explore opportunities around fostering water affordability. 

Looking forward to speaking soon.

After that, a more in depth conversation on 4/20, 4/24, or the following week in Flint with the relevant 
parties would be ideal to get things moving. 

Looking forward to it!

You are nicer than me. I don’t let them in if they arrive later than 30 minutes after the start of the 
meeting - smile. I’ll tell Harvey that Dennis has to leave at 10:30am and Harvey can continue 
meeting if necessary. Is it okay for me to schedule it now?

Might be safer but Fd really like it not to run over. At the last meeting two people didn’t show tip until the meeting had 5

No. Dennis Iras a meeting until Eicon and he really needs to be done by 1 :00. it can’t, run over i couldn’t get him out of

I don't think Dermis can go to Flint without having to completely reschedule a day and he is out of the office August 1 0 
and then August 12 - 25 so 1 really can't completely redo a. day. There’s no place to put things

If your schedule permits, let's go to Flint to meet with them next week, or we can ask them to come back to Lansing. We
