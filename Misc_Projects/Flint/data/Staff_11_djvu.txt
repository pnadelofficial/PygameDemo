Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 
Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 







Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to

Selected Key Project Experience 

For the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division Eric Rothstein has served 
as an independent utility advisor for mediation related to the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority 
(GLWA). Following execution of a Memorandum of Understanding and Articles of Incorporation by the 
Incorporating Municipalities (City of Detroit, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties, and the State of Michigan), 
Mr. Rothstein was appointed to serve as Implementation Planning Program Manager for the standup of the 
GLWA - a regional utility serving approximately 40% of the population of the State of Michigan. 

For Water Replenishment District of Southern California, Eric Rothstein was engaged to provide an expert 
report related to the consistency of the District’s rate setting requirements with industry-standard practices 
contemplating proportionate distribution of cost responsibilities based on cost causation. These practices are 
consistent with prescripts of State of California law. 

For Jefferson County, Alabama, Eric Rothstein has served as the County’s rate consultant since 2010. He 
has reviewed cost-of service analyses and alternative rate proposals to address the County’s outstanding sewer 
warrant obligations, developed revisions to its sewer rates approved in November 2012, and again in 
September 2013, and is leading strategic financial planning related to the County’s bankruptcy Plan of 
Adjustment. Mr. Rothstein has been deposed and provided expert witness testimony in various court 
proceedings stemming from the County’s declaration of bankruptcy in 2011, and has led development of a 
Municipal Advisor Report related to a planned Series 2013 Sewer Warrant issue to effectuate the County’s exit 
from bankruptcy. 


For the Halifax Regional Water Commission, Eric Rothstein led development of a Cost of Service and Rate 
Design report to the Nova Scotia Utility and Accounting Review Board (NSUARB Docket No. NSUARB-W- 



HRWC-R-11), in response to the Board’s Order and Decision to hold separate hearings to determine 
appropriate ratemaking methodologies for Canada’s first regulated water, wastewater and stormwater utility. 
Eric led preparation of the report and the development of cost allocation and rate design models to illustrate the 
implications of alternative methodological approaches. Eric supported development of HRWC’s subsequent 
application for water, wastewater and stormwater rates filed with the NSUARB in December 2012 and provided 
expert witness testimony in support thereof in April 2012. In April 2014, Eric prepared a HRWC Cost Shares for 
Use of the Angus L, Macdonald Bridge and provided expert witness testimony in M06127 - Halifax-Dartmouth 
Bridge Commission/Halifax Regional Water Commission: Waterline on the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge - HDBC- 
G-14 

For the City of Atlanta, since 2004, Mr. Rothstein has served as the Department of Watershed Management’s 
primary coordinator for its revenue bond issues used to finance its $3 billion wastewater Consent Decree 
program. This has included issues in 2004, 2008, 2009 (2), 2013 and 2015 and, in 2006, implementation of its 
Tax-Exempt Commercial Paper program with a shelf registration of $1.2 billion. Mr. Rothstein led development 
of the Department’s Financial Capability Based Schedule Extension Request Report used to secure the City’s 
13-year extension of its wastewater Consent Decree schedule. Fie prepared each of the Department’s Financial 
Capability Assessment filings. Fie has led the development and updating of strategic financial planning tools for 
water and sewer rate development and policy-level consideration of overall program financing strategies (as 
well as detailed project expenditure, status, and schedule tracking). 

For the Egyptian Ministry of Housing, through a USAID contract, Mr. Rothstein developed guidance on tariff 
setting, capital project prioritization, and strategic planning for the newly established water and wastewater 
sector regulatory agency. The project involved the development of a guidance manual, detailed financial 
planning and cost-of-service analysis modeling, and testing of financial analysis and prioritization tools with four 
major Egyptian utilities. Mr. Rothstein has also provided presentations on financial planning and strategic 
planning principles to USAID staff and Technical Assistance contractors. 

For the Milwaukee Wholesale Customers, through sub-contracts with SHEH, Inc., Mr. Rothstein reviewed the 
Milwaukee Water Works rate increase applications filed in 2010 and 2014, reviewed pre-filed testimony, and 
offered expert witness testimony related to revenue requirements and appropriate rates of return at hearings 
before the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. 

For several wastewater permittees facing Consent Decrees including the City of Akron, East Bay Municipal 
Utility District, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, Metropolitan Sewer District of St. Louis, and the 
City and County of Honolulu, Mr, Rothstein has assisted in the conduct of financial capability assessments 
per EPA prescribed methodologies and in the development of alternative approaches to assessment that more 
appropriately reflect utility capital financing options. These efforts have been used in the formulation of 
negotiation positions related to the scope and schedule of potential Consent Decree provisions. Mr. Rothstein 
is currently engaged with the City of Peoria, IL and with the Guam Waterworks Authority, in similar Consent 
Decree negotiations. 

For the National Association of Clean-Water Agencies, Mr. Rothstein has served as Principal Author for the 
development of several of the association's white papers and publications related to Financial Capability 
Assessments used to develop wastewater Consent Decree schedules. These publications include NACWA’s 
Financial Capability and Affordability in Wet Weather Negotiations (2007), and The Evolving Landscape for 
Financial Capability Assessment: Clean Water Act Negotiations and the Opportunities of Integrated Planning 
(2013). These papers provide critical reviews of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) 
established policies and guidance on financial capability assessments for wet weather programs and offers 
practical guidance for negotiations on enforcement policies and practices related to consideration of financial 
capability. 



For the City of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Mr, Rothstein served as Project Manager for a comprehensive cost-of- 
service rate studies for the City’s water, wastewater and stormwater systems conducted in 1997 and 2012, In 
1997, the consulting team facilitated decision-making through an extensive public involvement process that 
featured monthly meetings of a Citizen’s Advisory Committee comprised of a diverse set of stakeholder 
representatives, For both studies, detailed cost allocation analyses were conducted and customized computer 
rate analysis models developed to facilitate rate updating for budgetary changes, revision to cost allocations, 
and rate design modifications. 

For Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia, Mr, Rothstein has provided strategic financial planning, bond 
feasibility and comprehensive cost-of-service rate assistance since 2000. Strategic financial planning facilitated 
the City’s adoption of a seven-year, 11 percent per annum rate increase schedule to support infrastructure re- 
investment in excess of $400 million. Mr, Rothstein managed 3 bond feasibility studies over the course of the 
program implementation, helping the County to secure strong credit ratings and favorable financing. A cost-of- 
service study in 2004 involved special queries of a new billing system for development of user characteristic 
data and consideration of specific cost assignments for previously unsewered portions of the County’s 
wastewater system. 

Previous to his work as a utility management consultant, Mr. Rothstein served in several financial management 
positions for the City of Austin, Texas. In this capacity, he directed staffs of up to 22 members in utility 
ratemaking, evaluation of regionalization alternatives and proposed utility investments, analysis of capital 
financing options, internal control evaluation, and revenue forecasting.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 
Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 







Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to 
eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality is 
continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for 
Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

I spoke to Darnell this morning about the water issue. He indicated that they found a broken valve which was the cause 
of the problem.

We can work with the Legislative staff and prepare a response. Please note that Flint will he a recipient of $2 million in 
awards under the Financially Distressed Cities and Townships program - $900,000 for water and $1,1 million for the 
incinerator. This has not been announced publicly --Treasury will be circulating internally their overall 
recommendations late this afternoon or tomorrow morning. We can coordinate how this information might be 
disseminated with Comms to assist with our messaging in Flint (i added Jarrod to this email chain).

Subject: Backgrounder on Tuesday Flint water event 

Attachments: Briefing Flint grant announcement.docx 


Team, 

Here is background on the planned Tuesday event in Flint regarding the $2 million Distressed Cities grant and other 
issues connected to the water issue. 

There are plans for two press releases on Tuesday. The first will detail the two Flint grants and will be released by the 
governor's communications office. The other release, which would detail the other grants, would follow from Treasury 
with a quote from the governor. 

Mayor Walling has agreed to speak at the event, with Harvey Hollins and Dan Wyant representing the governor's office. 
Sen. Ananich has asked to speak, and it has been suggested that Rep. Neeley would speak and it might be better to add 
him to the program. Others, such as Deputy Director Workman and Emergency Manager Ambrose, would be present 
and available. 

The attached document includes details about the planned event, as well as background on the grants from Treasury 
and on the entire water issue from DEQ as well as Mayor Walling's Facebook post about the governor and links to the 
stories in the media about the issue. 

We have a room reserved and are working with the communications team in Flint to have microphones and other items 
needed for the event. 

Please let me know if there is any information you think should also be included, or anything that should be changed. 
Once everyone has had the opportunity to review, we can forward to the governor. 

Thank you, everyone, for your assistance. I know there are lots of moving pieces and many people involved.

Background 


■ The quality of Flint water has been a high-profile concern in recent weeks, with residents 
complaining about the color, taste and smell of tap water since a switch to Flint River water as a 
temporary source as a pipeline is built to Lake Huron as a water source starting in 2016. 

o Residents have attended meetings with jugs of brownish water. 

o U.S. Kildee has worked with labor and community groups to distribute bottled water. 

■ Mayor Walling has issued a letter (included below) calling for state and federal assistance for the 
city, including forgiveness of some $20 million in debt through the Drinking Water Revolving 
Loan Fund and calling for the governor to come to Flint personally. 

o Walling also submitted a guest column to the Flint Journal with similar requests. 



■ He said the loan forgiveness is needed for the city to upgrade its water 
treatment process. 

o Governor and Mayor Walling had a telephone conversation on Friday, and the mayor 
has pledged to work together on solutions. 

■ Rep. Sheldon Neeley also has sent the governor a letter, saying that his constituents "are on the 
verge of civil unrest." 

■ The Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the water situation, with a 
detailed backgrounder and talking points attached below. 

■ The Treasury Department is announcing Tuesday that Flint is among the cities receiving a 
combined $8 million the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships grant program. 

o The announcement of the other grants will follow the Flint announcement. 

■ The Flint grants are $1.1 million to allow the city to replace the functions of the 
old incinerator with new water pollution control facility allowing for the disposal 
of waste to landfills. 

■ The other is $900,000 to allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak 
detection survey, which will lead to prioritizing repairs. 

o A breakdown of the grants is included below. 

Treasury breakdown of Flint grants 

Flint Incinerator: The grant project entails shutting down the current Water Pollution Control Facility 
Incinerator (due to the incinerator not being up to new EPA standards). In order to meet EPA standards, 
it would cost roughly $8.8M in upgrades to the current incinerator. The grant funding will allow them to 
replace the functions of the old incinerator by constructing new facilities which will allow for the 
disposal of waste to landfills. 

Budget Breakdown 

Construction Contractor $1,050,000 

Project Management $50,000 

Total $1,100,000 

Flint Leak Detection: The grant project will allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection 
survey of the city water lines. The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak 
severity. This data will allow the city to prioritize leak repair. The project also covers the expense of 
conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition assessment on a portion of the city's pipes. The 
assessment will guide the city's water main replacement program. 


Budget Breakdown 

Project Planning $90,000 

Mobilization of Crew to Site $27,000 

Leak Detection < 16" diameter $378,000 

Leak Detection 16" diameter or > $270,000 

Pipe Condition Assessments $135,000 

Total $900,000 


DEQ backgrounder on Flint water 


Following the formal approval of Flint into the KWA in 2012, DWSD sent Flint a letter saying their 
contract was thereby terminated (by early 2013). 

Genesee County has been using DWSD water without a contract since May 2014. But Flint took the 
letter to imply a water cutoff, and promptly turned to DEQ with a proposal to use the Flint River (their 
historic backup system). 

This proposed shift was pitched primarily as a money saver. But it put the city in the business of water 
production, where they historically had been in the business of water transmission. DEQ approved the 
use of the river as a source, based on the treatment plant's past performance as a standby facility and 
the improvements we outlined prior to a switchover. 

Several municipalities around the state use surface water supplies (rivers): Blissfield near Monroe, 
Manistique, and Alma to name a few. 

The city completed the upgrades at the water plant the facility and DEQ approved it April 2014. 

There were some initial hiccups. Last summer, there were a couple of 'boil water' notices issued. One 
for a water test that showed e. coli, one for a break in the water main. 

The challenge to using the Flint River as a source is that the condition of the water is variable and 
changes with season and weather. It has substantially more organic matter than deep lake sources like 
Lake Huron. This organic matter is mobilized by high water events, and warm weather also can account 
for more organic material in the water. 

The treatment of the organic matter is done with chlorine. One might conclude that the continual 
answer is just to use more chlorine to achieve water safety. However, at some point on the continuum, 
the chlorine and organic matter create TTHM - total trihalomethanes - as a byproduct. When the 
standard for those is exceeded over several consecutive quarters of testing, the supply is required by 
law to issue public notice and submit an approved plan for addressing the situation. 

You'll note that this regulatory approach means TTHM testing is done quarterly. That means people who 
use the system are exposed to TTHM for several months before the public notice is required. It's 
because TTHM is a chronic health threat. Over the long term (measured in decades), continued 
exposure can contribute to some known health problems. If this were an immediate health threat, 
customers would receive immediate notification to boil their water or not use it. 

Put in context, the EPA (which established the standard and the rule) estimates the existence of the 
TTHM standard prevents an estimated 280 bladder cancer cases each year ... out of more than 330 
million people who use public water supplies around the country. 

It's not "nothing." State and federal law requires quarterly testing for TTHM and that the public be 
informed of it when the annual average of four quarters' worth of consecutive testing shows TTHM 
levels exceeding 80 parts per billion. Flint's results managed to exceed the annual average in three 
quarters, and they must develop a plan to address it. 

But it's not like an eminent threat to public health. Unlike an e. Coli or even total coliform bacteria 
maximum contaminant level, which require immediate public notification and response and are part of 
daily / hourly testing of public water supplies, TTHMs pose a public health concern with chronic, long- 
term exposure. 

It's clear the nature of the threat was communicated poorly. It's also clear that folks in Flint are 
concerned about other aspects of their water - taste, smell and color being among the top complaints. 



The Safe Drinking Water Act requires public water supplies be tested for more than 90 regulated 
contaminants, including microbial contaminants. The act, and the program here in Michigan, work to 
ensure that water is safe to drink. The act does not regulate aesthetic values of water. Here are some 
factors affecting the aesthetics of water in Flint. 

1. It's the Flint River. The water supplied by DWSD historically came from Lake Huron. It's softer. 
With hard water, you get a different flavor and feel. It's why General Motors suspended use of 
Flint Water - it was rusting their parts. Also, there's the 'organics' factor (discussed previously). 

2. The system is old. Flint has more than 500 miles of water pipes. More than half of those pipe 
miles are more than 75 years old. Much of it is cast iron. Hard water can react with cast iron and 
exacerbates the rusty factor, which creates that brown water that angry residents were holding 
up in jugs for the media cameras last week. Valve failure has also been a key challenge. The 
system has an estimated 7,500+ valves. When they stick open or stick shut, it affects the 
hydraulics of the system and increase areas of stagnation. The city has a backlog of valves that 
need to be addressed. They've done half a dozen or so since November. 

3. Flint is old. Many of the homes served by the system are old. Brown water complaints may also 
be attributable to cast iron pipes in customers' service connection to the city lines. The DEQ has 
been encouraging people with water coloration concerns to contact the city and see whether it 
is the service line or the City's line causing the issue. Again, discoloration is not an indicator of 
water quality or water safety, but we recognize that nobody likes it. 

In summary, the City of Flint has tremendous need to address its water delivery system. We are not 
aware that they have any capital improvement funds for preventative maintenance in place, much less 
line replacement project monies that will require hundreds of millions. 

The City was approved for a Revolving Fund loan in 2008 or 2009. As a Distressed Community, they 
qualified for flexible terms and 2 percent interest rate Revolving Fund Loan. After they were notified 
they were approved for the loan, they declined it. Previous SRF loans from the state to Flint bear an 
outstanding balance of $20.7 million today. 

The DEQ continues working with the city to address the TTHM issue. They can take interim steps - from 
scrubbing the insides of transmission lines to carefully monitoring the hydraulic challenges in their 
system - to address customers' aesthetic concerns. Their TTHM numbers already are showing dramatic 
improvement; the November testing showed only one of seven sample points exceeding the standard. 

The key now is that the standard is an average of three quarters' worth of results. It will be some time 
before they are officially "not in violation." However, depending on weather in 2015, it's not 
unforeseeable that we will be having this conversation again by next Christmas. 

The key to the conversation is that TTHM is not a top health concern. That's key because residents need 
to understand TTHM in context, and it is key because it appears the mayor has seized on the public 
panic (sparked, frankly, by their poor communication of the violation notice) to ask the state for loan 
forgiveness and more money for their infrastructure improvement. 

Another key thing to remember is that once the city connects to the new KWA system in 2016, this issue 
will fade in the rearview. 

Key messages: 

1. The DEQ Drinking Water program works with communities around the state to ensure that 
municipalities provide customers with clean, safe drinking water. 

Municipal water supplies are tested rigorously and regularly for more than 90 regulated 
contaminants, including microbial contaminants that pose an immediate public health concern. 


2 . 



3. Flint's exceedance of the TTHM standard should reassure residents that the testing program is 
effective. 

4. TTHM is not an immediate health threat. It is a chronic concern, one that can be problematic 
over the course of several decades of exposure. The public was notified because the law 
requires the city to make public notification, so that everyone can make informed decisions. This 
is particularly true for people with infants or those with compromised immune systems. 

5. The DEQ is working with the City to address the situation. Recent tests show the TTHM numbers 
dropping rapidly. The department will continue working with the city in the months ahead, and 
residents should feel confident that their water is safe to drink unless the DEQ or City notifies 
them otherwise. 

6. The discoloration and odor issues some Flint residents are experiencing are separate issues from 
the TTHM issue. TTHM is odorless, colorless and measured in parts per billion. 

7. Flint water customers who have questions or concerns about their water should first contact the 
city to get answers and help. They also can contact the Michigan DEQ. 

Mayor Walling's Facebook post 

Friend, 

Access to clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human right. 

That's why I just sent Gov. Snyder my Flint Water Improvement Plan. It focuses on the areas of safety, 
quality, access, investment and education. My letter urges the governor to quickly implement these 
ideas so that Flint's water is 100% safe. 

Please contact Gov. Snyder by calling (517) 335-6397 (or by clicking here) and ask him to take action 
immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. 

My plan offers new ideas and also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs 
at the state and federal levels. Here is my plan: 

Safety & Quality 

• 100% Safety is the standard 

• City of Flint releases testing data to assure safety and expands testing to households with 
support from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 

• Support alternatives for those advised not to drink the water by their doctors through the 
Michigan Health Endowment Fund and community partners to protect the vulnerable like 
seniors and infants 

• Bring on experienced river water treatment operational management in the City of Flint 

• Require water testing data to be released quarterly by law in all Michigan communities 
Access 

• Announce an amnesty program for turn-ons and reduce the turn-on cost in Flint 

• Develop a revised payment plan policy to allow customers to come back on to the Flint system 

• New Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance Fund 
for customers (modeled on Federal and State energy utility programs: Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program; Michigan Energy Assistance Program; State Emergency Relief) 

Investment 

• Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital Improvement Plan 
through Federal and State Investments 

• State approves City of Flint's Distressed Cities Fund applications 

• Federal and State forgiveness of payment to Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund 



• Federal and State financing for future improvements 

• City Water Department implements budgeted FY15 projects including leak detection, valve 
repairs, new pipes and meter replacements 

Education 

• Develop a community partnership to provide household and business customers with 
information on testing and conservation 

• Ongoing partnership with Michigan Department of Fluman Services, United Way, Salvation Army 
and community organizations to provide information on water assistance 

• Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with conservation and efficiency (piloted in 
summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

The struggle with our water has gone on for too long. The state must take action and do its part. Please 
ask Gov. Snyder to take action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. Thank 
you for your ongoing support.

Re Flint water... we should hopefully have something late today or tomorrow. Wayne's 
guys have a table with the historical rate info you wanted. They are putting together 
the reconnect $info. I want to make sure though that Jerry A. is comfortable with the 
numbers, etc. 

Also, my Beth is working with Wendy to figure out a time for the follow up Wayne Co 
mtgs. I am just confirming... we were going to do an internal meeting this week and 
get back to the County next lues the 17th.

While the chart is a bit cluttered with the different colored lines representing different years, in the

Fwd: PRESS RELEASE: Coalition for Clean Water Lawsuit Dismissed by Circuit Court 


Wayne & I have a call scheduled with the Mayor, City Atty, & the City Mgr @ 4:00 today. We are following up to see if 
in fact they inadvertently missed filing the appeal on the rate case. If so, in my mind that would be a huge, costly 
blunder (but that is why we are talking to them) which will greatly exacerbate the financial condition/solvency of the 
system. 

And recall (not that long ago) I believe we gave them approx. $2mm in SftF loan relief and approx. $2mm in grant 
money[cgap?j to improve the system. 

We are having staff look at possible other assistance from a financing or loan perspective. My sense is there will not be 
much there if any. 

p,s. - the Flint coalition lawsuit was dismissed (see attached)

For Immediate Release 


Lawsuit against City of Flint brought by Coalition for Clean Water Dismissed 

by Circuit Court 


Flint, Michigan - September 15, 2015 - The lawsuit brought against the City of Flint by the 
Coalition for Clean Water has been dismissed by Circuit Court Judge Archie Hayman. In his 
September 14 ruling, Judge Hayman determined that the plaintiff did not state a valid cause of 
action against the City of Flint, the Mayor and the City Administrator. Judge Hayman also 
determined that he did not have jurisdiction to provide the relief sought by the plaintiff. All 
counts of the Coalition’s amended complaint were therefore dismissed. 

The City of Flint has maintained communication with both the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to ensure all 
proper safety and quality standards have been followed. The MDEQ recently notified Flint that it 
is no longer in violation of the Safe Water Drinking Act due to total trihalomethanes (TTHM) 
following four consecutive quarters of testing showing levels below the federal action level. The 
City of Flint will continue to work to ensure safe, quality and affordable drinking water to its 
residents, businesses and visitors.

The City of Flint will continue to provide updates on its water progress through its website, 
cityofflint.com . Anyone with water issues is encouraged to call 810-766-7202 so that they can be

Updated Summary of September 15 Conference Call 


Attached is the summary (prepared by Wayne's staff) of the call we/Treasury had yesterday with Flint I would say 
nothing 'enlightening' really came out of the call. 

As indicated they asked about the status of the $30mm request to the Governor. Which coincident!’/ is the ballpark 
number they are at risk for in the rate lawsuitfs). 

We said we did not have an immediate response other than It would likely require an appropriation by the 
legislature. This would probably lead to similar requests from other urban communities; but, we are still looking at it. 


We are not aware of any existing qualifying projects that the City has sought funding for in the SRF -drinking water 
program. They had asked previously for some funds on the wastewater side but had withdrawn the request because 
they lacked match funds.

Any state or federal subsidized financing available? Something similar in structure to combined sewer overflow? 
It's not free money, but a better option

Summary: Conference Call with City of Flint 
September 15, 2015 


Participating: Tom Saxton, Wayne Workman, Fred Fleaden, Eric Cline, Mayor Walling, City 
Administrator Natasha Henderson, Finance Director Jody Lundquist, City Attorney Pete Bade, Assistant 
City Attorney Tony Chubb 


• The City of Flint is involved in two lawsuits regarding water and sewer rates: Kincaid and Shears. 

o It was stressed that the Shears and Kincaid lawsuits are both separate but are being litigated 
concurrently and that any developments mutually impact both suits. 

• It was noted that in the opinion of the City, both cases will continue to be litigated for some time due 
to the complexity of the issues involved. 

• In a related matter, the City Attorney noted that the Water Coalition lawsuit to force the City to 
purchase water from the City of Detroit was dismissed in Genesee County Circuit Court. 

Shears Lawsuit 

• Shears was decided by the Genesee County Circuit Court by a non-final order on August 17, 2015. 

o Among other things, the Court enjoined City officials from any longer imposing a 35 percent 
increase in water and sewer rates; from disconnecting water or sewer service due to 
delinquent bills, dating back to September 16, 201 1; and from placing liens on property due 
to delinquent bills, dating back to September 16, 201 1. 

o City officials have filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals seeking, among other 
things, a stay of the Genesee County Circuit Court injunction. 

o In the interim, City officials are complying with the Court’s order in Shears. 

• The City’s appeal is still being considered by the Court. No timeline for a decision is known. 

Kincaid Lawsuit 

• Kincaid was decided by the Michigan Court of Appeals on June 1 1, 2015. 

o The Court held that a 35 percent increase in water and sewer rates imposed by City officials 
on September 16, 2011, violated the City charter and that Emergency Manager Mike Brown 
had no statutory authority to later ratify those rate increases in May of 2012. 

o The Court of Appeals remanded the case to Genesee County Circuit Court. 

o City officials intended to appeal this decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, but missed the 
filing deadline by one day . 

• The City Attorney stated that litigation of this case must continue because some key issues have yet 
to be resolved, including: 

o The exact damages have not been clarified. 

o The issue of who has standing in this case remains unresolved. 


Financial Impacts 



Summary: Conference Call with City of Flint 
September 15, 2015 

City officials estimate that nullification of the 35 percent increase in water and sewer rates is costing 
approximately $600K/month. Therefore, if the Court orders either refunds or credits against future 
water and sewer bills retroactive to September 16, 201 1, the cost is estimated to be approximately 
$30M. 

o The Finance Director noted that since September 2011, the system has had a declining 
number of users, so the total potential refund is higher than basing calculations from the 
current number of users. 

o The City Administrator stated that the City has not developed a plan to issue a refund of this 
size because the City lacks sufficient funds to do so and they would be unable to operate at 
this point. 

The City Administrator noted that citizens are paying the latest monthly billing but that the City 
must contend with lower revenues for the foreseeable future. 

In addition, it was noted that if the City has to refund the Ready-to-Serve charge from September 
2011 through July 1, 2015, that this amount is approximately $10M. 

It was noted that the amount of delinquent funds owed to the City that are over 30 days old has 
grown from $7.8M to $8.4M since the ruling in the Shears Lawsuit. 

o Further, the City Administrator stated that because the City is prohibited from shutting off 
service for non-payment, the amount of delinquent funds is expected to continue to grow. 

In addition, the City Administrator noted that the measures taken to reserve funds within the system 
to address the financial issues has delayed needed capital improvements, which further exacerbates 
the problems within the system, but the City cannot address these capital needs without additional 
revenue. 

The City Administrator further stressed the importance of the State assistance sought by the Mayor 
in his September 14, 2015, letter to the Governor. 

o The Mayor requested $30M for infrastructure and capital improvements related to the City’s 
water and sewer system. 

o It was stressed by Treasury that existing funding options were very limited and we were not 
aware of anything short of a legislative appropriation. 

■ State funding of the City’s $30M request will likely invite requests from many other 
communities with similar needs. 

■ The State recently awarded the City $2M in Distressed Cities grant funds to 
implement improvements to their system. 

■ The State further provided the City with an additional $2M in relief for outstanding 
SRF/DWRF loans. 

■ Treasury is not aware of any current Flint projects related to their water quality issues 
that could be funded through the DWRF program and DEQ is responsible for 
managing DWRF eligible projects.

Subject: Flint Water Issue - Rep. Kildee Letter Received By Federal Agencies 
Importance: High 

Attached are two documents for your information: 1) A letter from US Representative Kildee to Craig Fugate of FEMA, 
HHS, EPA, and CDC and 2) a PowerPoint on Flint water concerns. Essentially, Representative Kildee is requesting FEMA 
take action to resolve potable water quality issues associated with the Flint water system. 

This is the first we heard of the letter and I actually found out from the FEMA Region V Director when he called me 
about an hour ago. He and I discussed a few things on this and he will respond advising they need to work through the 
local EM system in Ml (engaging the local EM and then EMHSD). They also are working through the local health 
department as I confirmed with Dr. Scott from DHHS. If Flint needs water or want water the first step is to handle it 
locally (at least on the EM side and then push up any gaps they cannot fill to us). We are not aware of any work the local 
EM has done in this regard. I will be with the FEMA Region V Director as well as the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, 
this week if they have questions. 

I have advised Dr. Jackie Scott from DHHS and will be sending her the letter and ppt.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Introducing Makayla* 



• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last 
week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns. 

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west 
side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with 
warm tap water. 

• Physical exam and development are normal. Makayla 
receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine lead and 
hemoglobin screening. 

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/dL. 


^Hypothetical scenario 


Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL... 


Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are considered 
elevated blood lead levels (EBL) 

Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff 

Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead level 

Disproportionately impacts low income, minority 
children 

Primary prevention is most important 



Primary Prevention 


• "Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear 
to be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental 
and housing policies should encourage 
PREVENTION of all exposure to lead " 


"Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary Prevention " 2012 
CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. 



What will happen to Makayla? 


• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of: 

- Decrease in IQ 

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points 

- Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ 
distribution 

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low IQs 
(<70) 

• Implications for special education services, employment, 
incarceration, life achievement, etc

pooled analysis. Environ Health Perspect, 2005. 113:894-9.

retardation and cardiovascular diseases from environmental lead 
exposure. Environmental Research, 2004. 94:120-33. 



Behavioral Burden 


Increased likelihood of : 

— ADHD behaviors 

— Delinquent behaviors and arrests 

— Total arrests and increased rates of arrests 
involving violent offenses 

— Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular, 
immunologic, endocrine, etc

adulthood. PLoS Med 5(5): elOl

The Cost 


"For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as well 
as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8-$60.6 billion) in 
lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive potential from 
preventable childhood lead exposure." 


"The present value of Michigan's economic losses attributable to lead 
exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using U.S. 
blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead levels) per 
year in loss of future lifetime earnings."

Lead in Water 


• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in controlling 
other sources. 

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in water 
sources, disinfectant uses, etc 

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable 
formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers 

— For about 25% o f infants drinking formula made from tap water at 10 
ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5 
micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL). 

- Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights 


Triantafyllidou, S., Gallagher. D. and Edwards, M. Assessing risk with increasingly stringent public health goals: the case of water lead and blood 
lead in children. Journal of Water and Health, doi: 10.2166/wh. 2013. 067 58-68 (2014). 

Edwards, M. Fetal Death and Reduced Birth Rates Associated with Exposure to Lead-Contaminated Drinking Water. Env. Sci. and Tech. 2013 DOI: 
10.1021/es4034952 



Preliminary Results 



Conclusions from BLL analysis 


% of children with EBL in Flint has increased 

— Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water 
lead levels 

Results underestimate risk: infants not screened 
for lead and water usage unknown. 

— Accurate exposure largely unknown since national 
childhood lead screening focuses on household lead 
exposure (paint, soil, dust) at later ages (1 and 2 yrs) 


Results are consistent and concerning. Primary 
prevention has failed. 



Next Steps 


Immediately limit further exposure 

— Encourage breast feeding 

— No tap water for high risk groups: infants on formula & 
pregnant mothers 

— Declare health advisory: allows WIC to administer water or 
ready-to-feed formula and other resources (Salvation Army 
& United Way water supplies) 

— Distribution of lead clearing NSF-approved filters 

— Public education regarding precautions (flushing, etc) 

— Re-connect to Lake Huron water source ASAP 



And Makayla 


Asymptomatic now 

But what will her future hold 
and an entire generation of 
Flint children?

RE: FDCVT - Flint 


Thanks. Are you suggesting they modify their request to one that asks for money for filters instead of the assessing since the 
assessing cost exceeds the grant and they couldn't do the project anyway?

One of my 'take-aways' from: the meeting this afternoon was to follow up on whether they could use those 
Distressed Cities' $s for filters. Remember last year they did receive $2rnrn which they used for water 
related items. This year they want funds for the property assessing area. Their project cost is more than 
the grant limit, it is not dear they realize that. The deadline application is Oct 15 if they were willing to 
change the application. Assuming that is doable. 

With Wayne away ( and before the 1:00 mtg)... a call was set up actually earlier today with Natasha 
Henderson. Do you care if we still do that ? The email setting it up is attached. Obviously we are not going 
to commit to anything. 

Let me know if you need anything else.

lorn, 


Below are the answers to your questions, if you have any further questions, let us know. Thank you. 

Do we know whether Flint has yet applied for any of these (FDCVT) $s ? 

ANSWER: We received an application from the City of Flint on September 17 th . The amount requested for the project is $2M 
(the limit for a local unit) and it is estimated to take $3.1M to complete the entire project. They also indicated that if full funding 
is not awarded, it is doubtful that they will be able to move forward with the project. The proposed project is: 

"The city proposes to hire a qualified contractor to provide property assessing services. Specifically, this contractor will 
create digital property sketches of all improved properties, evaluate existing property conditions and improvements by 



providing real property data verification, and conduct a comprehensive appraisal valuation study. This process will take place 
over a period of 3 years, from June 1, 2016 to July 1, 2019." 


Do we know if they have plans to? 

ANSWER: Since they asked for the entire $2M for the above project, we would assume they are not submitting any further 
projects, however we are not sure. 


And have they asked {& rec'd) $s from this program previously i.e., last year, and If so, what did they use those $s for? 

ANSWER: Treasury awarded Flint two grants in FY 2015 under the FDCVT program. Treasury has not yet received any 
reimbursement requests from the City. Therefore, we have not distributed any of the FDCVT grant related funds to the 
City. The two grants are:

Water Pollution Control Incinerator Shutdown 

Water system enhancements through

has allowed the City to replace miles of aged pipeline and begin efforts to install a specialized filter 
at the Water Treatment Plant. 

In February, Flint was awarded a total of $2 million through two Financially Distressed Cities,

Could they use these grant funds to purchase filters for individual residents for use in their homes ?

To be honest i am not sure... ! don't have the history/background to know whether we 'would actually turn them/communities 
down { & we might) if they can't fully fund their project, i am sure that area (assessing) is in chaos as well in Flint. 

If that were the case i.e., we would say no to the assessing project; then yes in terms of the switch to water related projects. I 

think the number I heard yesterday was 10,000-15,000 filters for $250k. Qr maybe you create a program to replace the curb-to- 
home lead piping. 

The call with Flint got cancelled today. They are not available now at that time.

Re: FDCVT - Flint 


There is a STC order for reassassment. It will take 3 years so they can pay in phases. They don't all the money at once. A 
permanent lead solution is best but more costly. I think we need a face with just a few City people DEQ, HHS to talk 
about realistic options, not inflamed rhetoric

Importance: High 

Attached is the draft release we would like to issue ASAP regarding the new plan for water filter distribution in the city 
of Flint. 

At a meeting with multiple community partners today, our local MDHHS office realized they could do distribution from 
the 2 Flint offices as long as the local community action agency could assist them in storing the larger quantities of 
filters. 

Locally, the groups will be issuing a press release from the local health department discussing distribution, but we feel it 
is important to also send this from MDHHS. 

We are happy to discuss this with Ron Fonger if you want him to be the first press call we make once we issue it.

State of Michigan 

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

nick LYON 

DIRECTOR 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

October 5, 2015 (517) 241-2112 

Water filters available for MDHHS clients in Flint beginning Tuesday 

LANSING, Mich. - Free water filters will be available to current Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services clients and Flint residents at four locations beginning Tuesday, October 6, at 
9 a.m. through a partnership between the MDHHS and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. Free National Sanitation Foundation certified water filters are being 
provided to Flint residents as part of the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing 
water concerns in the area. 

Current MDHHS clients are encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office location to obtain a free, certified home water filter. Residents who are not 
currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should visit the Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices located at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. 
Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

“Ensuring that families in the Flint area have access to resources that will help reduce the potential 
for lead exposure is our top priority,” said Nick Lyon, director of the MDHHS. “I want to thank 
our partners who have mobilized to make water filters available - a point that highlights the 
importance of continued collaboration at the local, state and federal level as we move forward.” 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food 
Assistance Program (FAP), Child Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance 
(SDA), or Social Security Insurance (SSI) recipients should bring valid identification and a copy of 
their water bill to their local MDHHS office to receive their filter free of charge. Flint residents 
who are not active MDHHS clients should bring identification and their water bill to the GCCARD 
location. 

Although blood lead levels throughout the city of Flint have remained steady, last week, MDHHS 
data was found to be consistent with a recent Hurley Children’s Hospital study indicating 
increased blood lead levels in children residing in two Flint ZIP codes after a 2014 change in water 
source. While lead paint remains the number one cause of lead poisoning in Michigan, the recent 
data prompted MDHHS to take action to reduce potential lead exposures through water sources. 

MDHHS is urging parents in Flint and throughout the state to do their part in preventing elevated 
blood lead levels in children. For more information about steps you can take now, visit 
www .michi gan . gov/lead , or contact your local health department. For updates on Flint water and 
available resources, visit www . michtgang . go v/flint. water .

RE: Release on Flint 


What if they are shut ins or can't get there? Where's the relief coming from? Is the Flint Transit Authority willing to 
extend complimentary transportation? W f ho is going to explain to the recipients how the filter fits on their faucet? 

1 know from experience that my wife never grew up building things out of Erector Sets, and she's terrible at reading 
"part a attaches to part b with two bolts enclosed in the third packet. Don't use the ones marked only for Delta faucets" 
oh, you get the point. 


Just a suggestion from a syntax point of view, the construction of the first sentence appears to allow anyone who is a 
DHHS client and anyone who is a Flint resident to receive a water filter. It isn't clear that it applies to a person who is a 
Flint resident who receives public assistance and not to other Flint residents. Secondly, don't forget that other Flint 
residents also should be entitled to a water filter and although the press release is about DHHS clients, we don't want to 
create additional confusion, A throw-away line about the other residents might be wise.

This is slated for distribution at. 4 p.rn, Need to hear if any concerns from anyone ASAP.

Subject: Release on Flint 
Importance: High 

Attached is the draft release we would like to issue ASAP regarding the new plan for water filter distribution in the city 
of Flint. 

At a meeting with multiple community partners today, our local MDHHS office realized they could do distribution from 
the 2 Flint offices as long as the local community action agency could assist them in storing the larger quantities of 
filters. 

Locally, the groups will be issuing a press release from the local health department discussing distribution, but we feel it 
is important to also send this from MDHHS. 

We are happy to discuss this with Ron Fonger if you want him to be the first press call we make once we issue it.

RE: Release on Flint 


Thanks, Chief. 


That is correct - anyone who is a DHHS client AND anyone who is a Flint resident will receive a water filter. 

They are trying to direct clients to go to DHHS office, ail other residents to the local Community Action Agency locations 
- though either can go to the other respective locations and walk out the door with a filter by using the same 
form/policy to ensure "no wrong door" and make as easy as possible. But they are trying to direct folks accordingly. 
Outlined in iede and 2 nd graph - will have them change headline to help with ciarity further. 

DHHS is still working on some of those first issues/Qs (shut ins, disabilities, etc) - working locally to get those 
components further refined. Active group including Area Agency on Aging, Co. Emergency Services, etc working on. 
Original plans for seniors was to see if Meals on Wheels volunteers could deliver and install but apparently interferes 
and would cause too much of a delay with delivery of hot food.

There were some rumors going around today (with an apparent FB recording of a Brita rep) and being reported by 
media that the filters may not be properly certified to handle lead. DHHS' toxicology lab has again confirmed that the 
filters being provided ARE NSF certified for lead reduction. 

They are working on a statement to share for our review and then to share immediately afterward before this gets any

Dave - please note in particular since you're with the Governor. Hopefully will be well cleared up by that time, but just

RICK SNYDER 
GOVERNOR 


State of Michigan 

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

Lansing 


nick LYON 

DIRECTOR 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

October 7, 2015 (517)241-2112 

State offering extended, weekend hours for water filter distribution at Lippincott GCCARD 

Nearly 5, 000 NSF certified filters issued by MDHHS to Flint residents since Monday 

LANSING, Mich. - Flint residents and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 
clients with a city of Flint water bill will now be able to take advantage of extended hours this 
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department 
2727 Lippincott location. Extended hours will be offered at the Lippincott facility only, and will 
run until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The other three 
locations will maintain 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. operating hours, Monday through Friday, for filter pick up. 

Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive, reemphasized that the Brita SAFF-100 
filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the NSF/ANSI 53 standards for 
drinking water treatment units. 

“The Brita faucet filtration system that we are distributing to residents are National Sanitation 
Foundation certified to reduce lead in drinking water,” said Dr. Eden Wells. “When connected 
appropriately, these filters improve water quality by filtering out contaminates including lead, 
chlorine, benzene and other chemicals.” 

Since Monday when MDHHS announced that free water filters would be distributed at four Flint 
locations, the state and GCCARD have partnered to issue approximately 5,000 free NSF certified 
water filters to residents that are on the city of Flint water system. The distribution of filters is part 
of the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing water concerns in the area. These 
NSF certified water filters remove lead in the water administered through water taps in homes. 

MDHHS clients and residents with a city of Flint water bill may take advantage of the extended 
hours at the Lippincott GCCARD. During the regular business hours, MDHHS clients are 
encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office location; 
residents on Flint water who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should 
visit the GCCARD offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw. Staff will be onsite at all 
four locations to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active recipients should bring valid identification and a 
copy of their water bill to their local MDHHS office. Flint residents who are not active MDHHS 
clients should bring identification and their city of Flint water bill to a GCCARD location. 

MDHHS is urging all residents do their part to prevent elevated blood lead levels in children. For 
more information prevention, visit www. michi gan, gov/lead, or contact your local health

FYi team 



There were some rumors going around today (with an apparent FB recording of a Brita 
rep) and being reported by media that the filters may not be properly certified to handle 
lead. DHHS' toxicology lab has again confirmed that the filters being provided ARE NSF 
certified for lead reduction. 


They are working on a statement to share for our review and then to share immediately 
afterward before this gets any further out of control. 


Dave - please note in particular since you're with the Governor. Hopefully will be well 
cleared up by that time, but just in case.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 


i 



Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, 
environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and 
Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, 
public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the 
state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the 
MEC for six years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan 
Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having 
joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public 
Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community 
Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served 
as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as 
Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the county’s 
bankruptcy and issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of 
Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, 
wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Children’s Health 
Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice 
for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Importance: 


High 


Please see attached and below. We're starting to get numerous media inquiries on these. 

MSU, Sed by Professor Eric Seorsone with the bulk of work paid for by the Mott Foundation, has apparently released two 
new reports today both related to EM law. One on Flint and one in general. 


Haven't had a chance to read in depth yet, but one key take away as highlighted by Seorsone is this: 


Our research points to the fact that Mmrnmrn isOMfEMM il: rbof bhl lilill te - come afiotzd fisrsi distress, not the only 
cause bat a major contributing factor. This is the first time we are aware of being able to quantify this conventional 
wisdom and place it in the fifty state context. And also that EMs often focus too much on just immediate fiscal crisis 
rather than public services, which is a major shortcoming of the Saw. 


Working on points now, but will likely center around lacking public services is one of the key reasons and our 
administration has made tackling that a priority and we never lose sight of that - exhibit A is Detroit and the rationale 
the Governor had outlined for action. That working to invest in local communities with targeted resources and 
programs is key and we have numerous examples of that. That we have had work groups help look at issue and identify 
root causes, ways to stem, early warning signs to prevent situations from rising to fiscal crises, etc. 


If anyone has any other immediate thoughts or feedback, please advise asap. 


Thanks,

Good Morning, 


Please find attached some new reports from MSU regarding the Flint EM years (201 1-2014) 
which is a follow-up to our 2011 report on Flint.

The second report documents the role of state government in the fiscal affairs of Local 
Government. In particular, you will note: 


Page 9, figure 4 that Michigan escalated its local tax limitations more than almost any 
state except Colorado

Page 1 1, figure 5, Michigan is a stick state in regards to local aid 

Page 14, figure 6, MI is ranked as being high cost and high revenue pressure (meaning 
revenue restrictions) which is the worst of both worlds 


Our research points to the fact that Michigan policies are a major part of the cause of local fiscal 
distress, not the only cause but a major contributing factor. This is the first time we are aware of 
being able to quantify this conventional wisdom and place it in the fifty state context. 

Thank you

Executive Summary 


One provocative pattern to emerge from the Great 
Recession is that instances of acute local fiscal distress 
have clustered in certain states and not others. As recently 
as last year in Michigan, a state appointed Emergency 
Manager was operating in each of 17 local governments 
and school districts. A recent California Policy Center 
report suggests that more than a dozen cities and counties 
in California - a state that has already experienced three 
recent, high-profile municipal bankruptcies and a near- 
bankruptcy in San Jose, the “capital of Silicon Valley” - are 
on the cusp of defaulting on general obligation bonds 

With the generous support of the C.S. Mott Foundation 
and Michigan State University, we have engaged in a 
multi-pronged, multi-method research program to assess 
the crucial but often overlooked role of state governments 
in shaping the ways in which cities respond to financial 
difficulties. This report, based on our analysis of a unique, 
nearly half-century-long dataset of state and local financial 
and policy information and correspondence with state 
officials, analysts and legal experts involved in state-local 
fiscal affairs, elaborates several key findings: 

• Municipal fiscal distress is not simply a local problem. 
State laws and policies provide state governments with 
extraordinary influence over the ability of cities to 
balance revenue and expenditure flows. The common 
perception that critical taxing and spending decisions 
are largely within a city government’s control tends to 
conceal this fundamental detail about American state- 
local fiscal relations. 

• The ways in which state lawmakers act on this 
influence varies from state to state and over time. We 
refer to the complex mix of laws and policies that 
prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions as 
the state context for local fiscal distress. Section 1 of 
this report assesses key elements of this state context 
for the lower 48 states since 1970. 

• Some states incubate local financial stress by 
simultaneously driving up spending pressures on 
their cities while curtailing their capacity to raise 
critical revenue. Since the 1970s, the proliferation of 
state-imposed tax revenue limitations, coupled with 
recurring cuts to state aid, has fostered a system that 
limits a city’s ability to fund critical services. Some 
state governments further undermine the fiscal capacity 


of their cities via state laws and policies that engender 
steep expenditure-side pressures (e.g., devolving 
program responsibilities or driving up labor costs). We 
classify these states as incubators of fiscal distress. 

• Michigan incubates financial stress among its local 
governments. Michigan’s particular mix of stringent 
limitations on local revenue and its relatively low level 
of financial assistance to cities, coupled with spending 
pressures stemming from spiking local service burdens 
and increased labor costs, creates conditions that drive 
up the potential for local fiscal distress. 

• Because state governments can foster dramatically 
different state contexts for local fiscal stress, there is no 
single model policy for state intervention in distressed 
cities or for prevention of local fiscal distress. A 
policy that does not address a state’s unique context 

is unlikely to help cities escape financial trouble over 
the long term. State lawmakers must decide which 
legal and political tradeoffs they are willing to make 
to support city fiscal health. Michigan lawmakers, 
for instance, must recognize that the state context 
contributes to the problem of local fiscal distress. An 
aggressive intervention policy does little to curtail the 
consequences of this state-imposed context. Section 
2 of this report draws policy lessons from comparable 
states in an effort to illustrate alternative approaches to 
state involvement in local fiscal affairs. 

This report’s practical recommendations are aimed at 
assisting the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
policy and legal approach to local fiscal crises. These are 
not overly startling recommendations, yet they are easy to 
neglect because policymakers tend to focus more on short- 
term political gain rather than the histories and unintended 
consequences of policies that, over time, become 
increasingly difficult to alter. Some key recommendations: 

• Creating a state agency that coordinates services to 
local governments and offers technical support and 
fiscal monitoring. 

• Raising awareness among citizens and state decision 
makers that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at 
the local level. Though state governments are certainly 
part of the solution, they can be a big part of the 
problem as well. 


Introduction 


A recent spate of research and media reports suggest that as 
the fiscal consequences of the Great Recession continue to 
subside, state and local fiscal conditions are on the upswing. 
American cities and locales, however, are not yet out of 
the woods. A recent analysis from the National League of 
Cities strikes the proper tone of caution when reporting 
that, though indeed state governments have recovered (albeit 
slowly), “...local fiscal health has not yet fully returned to pre- 
recession levels. ... While tax revenues continue to improve, 
increases in service costs, long-term infrastructure needs, 
employee wages, and pension and healthcare obligations, 
along with decreased levels of state and federal aid, continue 
to constrain the [local] fiscal oudook” (McFarland and 
Pagano, 2014, p. 1, emphasis added). 

One thought-provoking pattern to emerge from the aftermath 
of the Great Recession is that the fiscal outlook seems to 
be particularly bleak among local governments in certain 
states. The city of Detroit’s bankruptcy proceedings may 
have indicated that Michigan is something of a hotbed for 
local financial disaster. Yet a far more damning indicator 
is the prevalence of financial distress among the state’s 
other local governments. As recently as last year, 17 local 
governments and school districts were operating under the 
control of a state-appointed emergency financial manager. 
Recently, Michigan’s most populous county, Wayne, was 
recently designated for financial emergency status as well. 
Michigan does not stand alone. News from California, a 
state that has already seen four cities enter the municipal 
bankruptcy process since 2008, is equally discouraging. The 
authors of a recent report conducted for the California Policy 
Center argue that more than a dozen cities and counties in 
California are statistically far more likely than “a typical U.S. 
city or county” to enter bankruptcy proceedings or default 
on general obligation bonds, with several cities - such as 
Compton, King City, Sutter Creek and lone - are a whopping 
20 to 40 times more likely to experience acute financial crisis 
(Joffe and Larkedring, 2015). 

What is it with local governments in these states? When 
it comes to urban fiscal problems, there is much blame to 
go around. Some blame a mixture of national and global 
economic forces beyond the control of state and local 
policymakers. Others contend that the cities facing severe 
budget crises have only themselves to blame. The goal of 
this report is to refocus attention on the crucial but often 
overlooked role of state governments in determining the ways 
in which cities respond to financial difficulties. How and in 
what specific ways do state governments structure this local 
response? Is it possible to assess the fiscal value that all states 
- via their mix of policies, laws and institutions - may add to 
or take away from local fiscal decision making? Is it truly more 
challenging to gain and maintain fiscal sustainability in certain 


states than it is in others? And in light of this consideration 
of the role that state governments play in structuring local 
fiscal decision making, in what ways do state governments 
choose to - or choose not to - internalize their role in the 
design and administration of their fiscal distress intervention 
policy? In other words, can we identify policy self-awareness 
among state governments that place particularly onerous fiscal 
pressures on their local lawmakers? 

To respond to these important questions, we, with the generous 
support of the C.S. Mott Foundation and Michigan State 
University, set out on a multi-pronged, multi-method research 
program at a critical time in which a new era seems to be 
dawning for state-local fiscal relations. This report summarizes 
the findings of the first stage of this ongoing project. 

Section 1 of this report develops an indicator for the state 
context for local fiscal distress based on the mix of state 
laws and policies that directly influence the revenue and 
spending decisions of local governments. This section 
uncovers a number of compelling patterns in the state 
imposition of revenue and spending pressures over the 
past quarter-century. Chief among these patterns is that, 
although a number of states have taken measures to severely 
limit the revenue capacity of their local governments 
(thus reducing the resources available to maintain critical 
services) and several states have devolved greater service 
responsibilities (and higher spending burdens) to their local 
governments, only a small handful of states simultaneously 
drive up spending pressures while aggressively curtailing 
local governments’ capacity to raise revenue. Taken 
independently, state-imposed revenue- and expenditure-side 
pressures can play a determinative role in local fiscal decision 
making. Taken together, as in states such as Michigan and 
California, they incubate local fiscal distress and can serve to 
foster fundamental budgetary imbalances that more fiscally 
challenged local communities are ill-equipped to overcome. 

In Section 2, we draw on interpersonal communications 
with key personnel in several states to assess key elements 
of state policies for intervening in fiscally distressed 
local governments. We set out to identify similarities in 
intervention policies - of which Michigan’s is the poster 
child - and to learn how other states approach local fiscal 
crises differently. From our work with the state officials, we 
illustrate how state governments can more effectively align 
policy with the nature of the problems faced by cities in 
distress, as well as how state-imposed constraints hamper 
cities’ abilities to balance revenues and expenditures over the 
long-term. In Section 3, we combine the lessons from Sections 
1 and 2 to outline recommendations that can assist the C.S. 
Mott Foundation, state and local officials, and Michigan 
residents in identifying a more effective approach to local 
fiscal crises. 


Section 1: Assessing How States Set the 
Context for Local Fiscal Distress: Revenue 
Squeezes and Expenditure-side Pressures 


Two essential powers that local officials enjoy are their 
authority to raise revenues and their power to allocate 
those revenues as they see fit via public expenditures. In 
local media and policy research, city officials are sometimes 
lauded for what are perceived as exciting local policy 
outcomes, such as when a city makes a significant move 
up the “America’s Greenest Cities” or “Child Well-being 
and Health” rankings. More commonly, they are chastised 
for decisions deemed detrimental to the city’s future, 
such as providing generous benefits to the municipal 
workforce, slashing essential services, enacting a rigid 
historical preservation agenda or raising licensing fees. Yet 
the common perception that critical taxing and spending 
decisions - and, by extension, the apportionment of blame 
and credit associated with the outcomes of such decisions 
- are largely within a city government’s control conceals 
a fundamental detail about American state-local fiscal 
relations: state laws and policies provide state governments 
with extraordinary influence over nearly every aspect of city 
budgeting. From the type and level of financial assistance 
that state governments deliver to state-imposed controls 
over local revenues; to the growing practice and use of 
state mandates, preapproval and preemption; to minimum 
service standards; to the formal or informal consultations, 
advice or technical assistance that state governments may 
(or may not) provide, local governments in America, in the 
words of influential legal scholars Gerald Frug and David 
Barron (2008, p. 75), simply “do not have anything like the 
kind of local fiscal autonomy often attributed to them.” 

States influence local governments’ capacity to balance 
revenue and expenditure flows in a variety of ways. In 
this report, we focus on two core dimensions of this 
state context for local financial distress. 1 The first is the 
degree to which states participate in adding or reducing 
local revenue capacity via the policy balance between the 
buoyancy of state-granted aid and shared revenue, and the 
severity of state-imposed controls over city tax revenues. 
Although most states exhibit a relatively balanced policy 
approach to local revenue capacity, some state governments 
have responded to local revenue challenges by granting 
greater access to state intergovernmental aid while mostly 
suppressing financial controls over local taxes. These 
are revenue “carrot” states. Another group - revenue 

1 Formally defined as the complex, multidimensional, legal-policy 
frameworks that prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions. 


“stick” states, of which Michigan is a prime example - have 
responded to local revenue challenges by ratcheting financial 
controls while offering thin or uncertain compensatory 
aid. Simply put, we expect it to be far more challenging 
to maintain a sustainable fiscal outlook in states that 
simultaneously suppress own-source revenue capacity and 
transfer very little aid to municipalities, particularly during 
national or state economic downturns. 

State policies and actions also burden the opposite 
end of local budgetary processes: decisions over public 
expenditures. Few, if any, local spending responsibilities 
exist because cities choose to take them on. The state 
decides. 2 Spending pressures can be subtler. For instance, 
local labor costs, which account for a large slice of most 
cities’ budgets, are heavily influenced by state policies and 
regulations concerning municipal employees’ wages and 
level of retirement and health care benefits. 3 This basic 
fact should give pause to those who instinctively attribute 
chronic local fiscal distress to “profligate spending on public 
employees” (Greenhut, 2012, pp. 1-2) or “spiraling labor 
and pension costs” (Rozansky, 2012). To borrow again from 
Frug and Barron’s seminal work (2008, p. 199), “Although 
cities are often criticized for granting overly generous 
pensions and health care to their employees, sometimes 
they become supporters of municipal employees’ benefits 
because the state requires them to do so.” Our more general 
argument here is that it is foolish to claim to correctly 
diagnose the causes of local fiscal distress without careful 
examination of the spending context in which states place 
their cities. In this paper, we aim to capture a large slice 
of this expenditure-side context by assessing state public 
sector collective bargaining policies (specifically, those 
covering municipal police, firefighters, teachers and other 
local employees) and public employee union membership 
coverage. 


2 Via specific provisions (or the absence of such provisions) regarding 
local statutory authorization, budgetary constraints or more general 
interpretations of local governments’ home rule authority. 

3 For instance, Michigan, even after the adoption of right-to-work 
legislation in late 2012, mandates binding arbitration for public safety 
officers in the event that involved parties in a labor contract dispute 
cannot reach an agreement. Massachusetts pays out benefits to local 
employees through the State-Boston Retirement System via formulas 
established by state law. Illinois law does not mandate city or employee 
benefit or contribution levels, instead favoring local flexibility in the 
control over pension costs. 




The final segment of this section considers how these 
revenue- and expenditure-side pressures interact within 
and across all U.S. state governments. As one might expect 
(or at least hope), these two competing dimensions tend 
to work against one another. States that are more revenue 
stick (meaning local tax limitation increases outpace 
the distribution of state aid) tend not to impose equally 
exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least in relation to 
local labor costs. For many states that do drive up labor 
and service costs via their mixture of policies, these costs 
are at least partially offset via a more resilient and vibrant 
aid environment, coupled with limited own-source revenue 
restrictions. A few states, such as Michigan and California, 
place strict limits on local own-source revenues while at the 
same time providing only meager intergovernmental aid and 
imposing costly labor and service obligations. We contend 
that these states have structured local fiscal policymaking 
in a way that effectively incubates local financial distress. 
These state contexts are the most egregious in hampering 
the exercise of local fiscal power; yet the nature of the 
problem for cities may be much worse - state-imposed 
budgetary imbalances can engender recurring structural 
deficits and diminished local service capacity, particularly 
among the states’ older, industrial urban areas.

State governments, by virtue of their superior constitutional 
position, have sweeping legal powers to regulate local 
finance. Central to our assessment of the state’s role 
in local fiscal distress are state controls over the two 
dominant sources of city revenue: state aid and local 

Figure 1. Mapping the Average 
State Aid Environment Since 1970 


taxes. Local governments occupy a weak position in the 
American federal system, causing local officials to rely 
heavily on, in the words of one analyst, “whatever sources 
of income the states are willing to let them tap into” or 
“whatever financial assistance” the states are willing to 
provide (Berman, 2003, p. 89). Sbragia (1983) aptly refers 
to the condition of American federalism as “the municipal 
money chase,” and in the absence of a vibrant federal aid 
environment in the United States, state aid - in the form 
of shared taxes (typically sales, income and gasoline) and 
restricted or unrestricted grants - continues to be a major 
source of local government revenue, accounting for roughly 
a third of local revenue, on average, during the past two 
decades (Berman, 2003; Urahn et al., 20 12). 4 

The importance of a well-designed state aid system is hard 
to overstate. It allows local officials greater flexibility in 
responding to economic pressures and the service needs of 
residents. This flexibility is particularly valuable during 
periods of economic downturn. Because local governments 
vary widely in their tax bases and in their ability to raise 
critical own-source revenues, influential research illustrates 
the equalizing potential of state aid, particularly in helping 
to smooth out revenue gaps between wealthier and poorer 
local jurisdictions (Pelissero, 1984; Stein and Hamm, 1987). 
In the past few decades, very few states target aid to local 
governments as a function of local need (Stein and Hamm, 

4 Though formulas for the distribution of local aid can vary significantly 
across states (as well as within states over time), all states provide 
some form of aid to local governments - often from a historical 
exchange in which cities would forgo the right to collect certain taxes 
in exchange for the states returning revenues from those taxes in some 
form. States typically allocate shared revenue for specific purposes 
or link it to particular functions of local government. Some shared 
revenue, however, is unhindered by such state restrictions and can be 
spent as local lawmakers see fit.

1994). The level of state aid that is available can make 
it possible for certain jurisdictions - for instance, older, 
industrial cities experiencing significant job loss coupled 
with a much reduced tax base - to at least afford minimum 
levels of services and possibly respond to growing service 
demands on the heels of a crippling state or national 
recession (see Ladd and Yinger, 1994). 

How then can we characterize the critical state aid portion 
of the state-controlled revenue environment for American 
cities? Figure 1, which illustrates trends in per capita state 

aid to three classes of city governments, shows a steady Figure 2. The Uneven Development of State Aid 

upward trend in transfers (per capita) received from state Environments 

governments. Though it is beyond the scope of this project 
to analyze specific revenue-sharing rules and aid formulas 
over time and across state contexts, our city financial data 
allow us to compare important trends in what the Census 
of Governments classifies as “Total Intergovernmental 
Revenue from the State Government.” 5 In other words, we 
plot data indicating the fiscal outputs of these rules and 
decisions. As Figure 1 illustrates, the positive trend over 
time is particularly strong for cities with populations over 
100, 000. 6 On average, it would seem that state governments 
have helped at least larger cities meet increasingly 
difficult financial conditions through the extension of 
intergovernmental transfers. 

Figure 2, which compares levels and growth of per capita 
state aid across the contiguous 48 states, paints a bleaker 
portrait. Consistent with the findings presented in Figure 
1, 43 of the 48 states exhibit positive growth rates, meaning 
that roughly 90 percent of the lower 48 states provided 
higher levels of aid in the current era than in the early 1970s 
(mean increase = 256 percent). Figure 1, however, masks 
the considerable unevenness with which state governments 
deliver aid. This unevenness is on display in Figure 2, 
where fewer states provide above average levels of aid, and 
most states exhibit relatively flat growth in the distribution 
of state aid. 7 


5 This includes state grants-in-aid, regardless of basis of distribution; 
local share of state-collected taxes; payments in lieu of taxes on 
state property; and reimbursement for services performed for state 
government (e.g., care of state prisoners in local jails, construction 
or maintenance of state highway facilities, etc.) (U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, 2006). 

6 In 1970, these cities received roughly $160 per capita (in real 2005 
dollars) in state intergovernmental revenue; in 2005, the most recent 
year in our time series, average per capita aid was $470. Though the 
growth rate for small and medium-sized cities is not as steep, the 
steady uptick in average per capita state aid exemplifies a healthier 
state aid environment than in the past. 

7 As is indicated by the maroon-colored vertical line, the average 
per capita aid provided to local governments in 2005 was just over 
$340. Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and Utah provided around $40 per 
person, on average. New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, on the other hand, distributed intergovernmental 
revenue at an annual rate at or around $1,000 per resident.

One key reason for this unevenness is that state aid tends to 
ebb and flow with changing state-level economic conditions 
(Berman, 2003, pp. 100-102). More generally, state 
intergovernmental aid - particularly those discretionary 
resources distributed via statutory aid policies and 
unprotected by state constitutions - is inextricably linked 
to state legislative budget battles. State legislatures and 
governors, scrambling to balance their own budgets, are 
simply more likely to risk citizen backlash from significant 
aid cuts during periods of widespread budget shortfalls. 
What is more, state lawmakers across the country seem to 
be looking with decreasing favorability on the idea of, in 
the derisive words of one Wisconsin legislator, “being an 
ATM machine for local governments” (Rinard, 1999, p. 1). 

Figure 2, however, illustrates that not all states have chosen 
to respond to their revenue difficulties by making cuts 
to intergovernmental aid. A study from Pew’s American 
Cities Project reports that Connecticut, which provides 
one of the more vibrant aid environments in the country, 
chose to slightly bolster intergovernmental aid to its 
local governments on the heels of the Great Recession (in 
fiscal year 2010) and has not reported a cut since then. 
Nebraska, on the other hand, canceled all funding to its 
local governments in 2011; Maryland, California, Arizona, 
Nevada, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming made 5 
to 6 percent cuts that same year. All else being equal, we 
would expect it to be far less onerous to balance revenue 
and expenditure flows in city governments in states such 
as Connecticut, New York or Massachusetts - i.e., states 
where key state decision makers seem less inclined to 
shift service costs to local governments via cuts in state 
aid during times of state financial stress - than in cities

Layering of TELs Since 1970 


facing similar sets of environmental, political or managerial 
conditions in states that provide lower or more volatile 
levels of intergovernmental aid. 

State policies regarding levels and delivery of state aid are 
but one piece of an increasingly complex set of structures 
that govern local revenue capacity. In a classic textbook 
on American intergovernmental relations, Stephens and 
Wikstrom (2006, p. 196) remark, “Without doubt, the most 
important mechanism that the state has for influencing 
the political behavior of local officials involves financial 
assistance.” This may have been true in the 1970s or 1980s, 
and to be sure it is a fundamental tenet of traditional 
models of fiscal federalism, but the most important 
mechanism for controlling local fiscal behavior in the past 
quarter- century is the tax and expenditure limit (TEL) - 
a label that broadly captures state attempts to limit the 
taxing and/or spending authority of its local governments 
through constitutional amendment or legislative enactment. 

State governments have long imposed some manner of 
TEL. 8 Figure 3 tracks the adoption of TELs since 1970 
across the four most common categories: rate limits - which 
are overall or specific tax rate limits that set the ceiling on 
the aggregate tax rate, which cannot be exceeded without 
a vote of the electorate; property tax levy limits, which 
constrain the total amount of revenue that can be raised 
from the property tax (independent of the property tax 
rate); assessment increase limits, which cap the growth rate of 
assessed values and is intended to control the ability of 
local government to raise revenue either by reassessment 
of property or through escalation of property values; and 

8 For instance, the first states to establish property tax rate limits were 
Rhode Island (1870), Nevada (1895), Oklahoma (1907) and Ohio (1911). 



8 




limits on general revenue or general expenditure increases, which 
set the maximum growth rate of total revenue or total 
spending. 


Whereas a great deal of research has shown that the 
appearance of even a single TEL constrains the capacity 
of local officials to generate revenues on their own (see 
Poterba and Rueben, 1995; Shadbegian, 1996, 1999; it is 
the accumulation or layering of fiscal constraints that can 
be particularly damaging to the revenue capacity of local 
lawmakers. 9 In single-TEL states, for instance, raising 
assessments might be employed to circumvent property 
tax rate limits and vice versa; in states that impose only 
an assessment cap, this single limitation could potentially 
be overcome by adopting a higher rate. These methods 
of circumvention were common early in the 1970s, when 
24 of the 29 states adopting some form of TEL imposed 
only one constraint (mostly rate limits), and a mere five 
states imposed two revenue TELs. Today, at least 27 of 
the contiguous 48 states impose multiple revenue TELs. 
Nineteen states impose two, and eight states - Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Mexico and Washington - apply three local tax limitations. 

The number of TELs in a state does not necessarily capture 
the severity of the limitation(s), though it is reasonable 
to expect a higher frequency of TELs to create a more 
restrictive local tax environment. Figure 4 displays a 
measure of TEL severity (see appendix regarding our 
research approach beginning on page 25), with the open 
point illustrating the severity of the state’s TEL in 1970, 
the closed (maroon) point plotting restrictiveness in 2005, 
and the dashed horizontal line representing the change 
in severity of the state’s tax limitations. 10 Figure 4 reveals 
some noteworthy patterns that illustrate the reality of state 
policy choices regarding local tax structures. Michigan, a 
state that imposes one of the more onerous sets of revenue 
restrictions, achieved this status via a one-two punch of 
major constitutional amendments enacted by voters: the 
Headlee Amendment in 1978 and Proposal A in 1994. 11 The 
Headlee Amendment capped local property tax millage 
rates to the rate of inflation. Proposal A - a constitutional 
amendment quite similar to Proposition 13 in California, a 
state with a similarly restrictive fiscal relationship with its 
locales - further limited local property tax revenue growth 

9 Rising adoption rates are on display in Figure 3. So, too, is the 
increasingly common phenomenon of TEL layering, meaning the 
imposition of state-imposed controls on multiple elements of the 
local tax structure. And those controls are growing: in 1970, 29 of the 
contiguous 48 states had at least one revenue TEL; today, some 41 of 48 
states have at least one local revenue limit. 

10 The measure of TEL severity, initially proposed by Amiel, Deller and 
Stallmann (2009), indexes six key characteristics: the type of TEL (see 
discussion above), if the TEL is statutory or constitutional, growth 
restrictions, method of TEL approval, TEL overrides and exemptions, 
and method of override. For a more detailed discussion of this 
measure, see Amiel, Deller, and Stallmann (2009) and Maher and 
Deller (2013).

by changing the system of assessment to cap individual 
property values and prohibiting cities from “rolling up” 
a millage to the rate of inflation if actual property value 
growth was lower than inflation. 12 Taken together, these 
two large TEL ratchets, which came 17 years apart and 
layered on top of an already aggressive property tax rate 
limit, placed tremendous pressure on local lawmakers’ 
ability to generate critical revenue (Brunori et al., 2008). 
Contrast Michigan’s approach to that of Massachusetts’s 
Prop 2 Vi, a similarly infamous state-imposed TEL, which 
was passed by referendum in 1980 and effectively caps 
local property tax levies at 2.5 percent of real property 
value. Massachusetts’s relatively moderate position on the 
severity index owes much to the state’s choice to apply no 
corresponding rate, revenue or assessment limits on local 
lawmakers. 

TELs, taken alone, are neither inherently good nor bad. 

They have been alternately portrayed as necessary evils 
for taming “Leviathan” city governments (Brennan and 
Buchanan, 1979; Craw, 2008; Downes and Figlio, 1999), 
or as just plain evils that stifle cities’ abilities to pursue 
innovative visions for their futures (Frug and Barron, 

2008). 13 However, over three decades after the tax revolt 
movement took hold in a major way in states such as 
California and Michigan, the widespread adoption of local 
TELs depicted in Figures 1 and 2 has had two overarching 
effects: the first is the loss of local revenues; the second is 
decreasing local reliance on property taxes. 14 There is little 
evidence to suggest that TELs, however, promote local fiscal 
sustainability. The reason is that local spending mostly 
goes unaffected by revenue limits (Dye and McGuire, 1997), 
particularly in the absence of state-imposed spending lids, 
which exist in only a small handful of states. 15 

In sum, the proliferation of state-imposed TELs has 
helped to create a national state-local fiscal system that 
is simply less conducive to local governments’ abilities to 
fund their own activities. 15 States with more aggressive 
local TELs - such as Michigan, Colorado and California 

12 Many other provisions of both the Headlee Amendment and Proposal 
A are related to other parts of the state finance system, and a detailed 
examination of the depth of both laws would be a paper unto itself. 

We will discuss the impacts of these types of laws, generally and in 
Michigan, later in the paper. 

13 To be sure, they are a frequent source of local consternation, 
particularly as fixed costs occupy a larger share of local budgets and 
demand for services - driven by postrecession unemployment rates, 
population changes and other factors - continues to rise. 

14 Indeed, in many state contexts, forgone property tax revenues have at 
least partially been recovered via more regressive revenue sources - 
such as fees and, where allowed, sales taxes. 

15 This is an important point that is often obscured by the frequent 
reliance on the TEL acronym (Tax and Expenditure Limits). 

16 Amidst the national clamor for government austerity and fiscal 
responsibility, it is important to point out that these activities - 
particularly in the states that impose the most formidable set of 
revenue constraints, such as Michigan, California and Colorado - 
include essential local services such as public safety and infrastructure 
maintenance, which are critical functions of local government. 


- hinder the revenue capacity of their local governments. 
This capacity is vital during even the most moderate of 
economic downturns because service demands tend to 
rise and state aid tends to drop. Revenue slack, however, 
was particularly vital during the most recent recession. In 
previous downturns, home prices mostly remained stable, 
thus steadying property tax revenues (particularly in 
relation to sales and income taxes). In the 2009 recession, 
property tax revenues, already slowed in certain states 
via state-imposed TELs, plummeted in simultaneity with 
state aid. The good news, as we illustrate below, is that 
a relatively small number of states impose such crippling 
revenue constraints from both ends: meaning states 
that both limit own-source revenue capacity while also 
providing far from vibrant levels of state aid. The bad news 
is that, for local officials who must operate within those 
state environments, even small declines in revenues can 
present tremendous budgetary challenges. 

Napping the Revenue Squeeze: Revenue 
“Carrot" and Revenue “Stick” States 

As property tax revenues continue to erode as a function 
of state-imposed TELs and local governments have become 
more reliant on state aid, some observers have suggested 
that state governments have responded to their expanding 
role in local fiscal affairs by providing greater levels of 
intergovernmental revenues (Berman, 2003; Sokolow, 2000; 
Dye and McGuire, 1997b). 17 This reading of state-local fiscal 
dynamics is somewhat supported by comparing trends in 
average levels of state aid to local governments exhibited 
in Figure 1 and total revenue limit adoptions depicted in 
Figure 3. However, our data allow for a far more detailed 
look at how local revenue capacity is being affected by state 
policies for local governments within each of the lower 48 
states. 

Figure 5 depicts a rough state-level indicator of the severity 
of state restrictions on local revenue capacity. States for 
which our standardized measure of per capita state aid 
far exceeds our standardized measure of the severity of 
local revenue limits - such as Connecticut, New York, 
Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey - 
are depicted in orange and labeled revenue carrot states. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be buttressed by 
their state context. As was pointed out above, a well- 
structured state aid environment increases the overall fiscal 
capacity of local governments and, according to Pagano and 
Hoene (2010, p. 260), can provide “a level of equalization 
and base support for municipalities that may lack other 
resources.” Additional value to local revenue capacity 
stems from the fact that critical own-source revenues are 

17 Greater local reliance on state aid does not necessarily mean that 
state officials have “anteed up,” a point that, mainly because of data 
constraints, is too often overlooked.

either altogether unencumbered by the absence of state 
TELs, as in Connecticut; limited only on the margins, as in 
Rhode Island or Tennessee; or limited via more aggressive 
TELs offset via significant funding from the state, as in 
Massachusetts. 

Revenue stick states - such as Michigan, Colorado, 

Washington and California - are depicted in brown. These 
state governments (or state citizens via the referendum or 
initiative process) constrain the fiscal autonomy of local 

government officials rather than buttress it via state aid. Figure 5. Revenue “Carrot” and Revenue “Stick” 
An extensive body of research on the local effects of state- States 
imposed TELs strongly suggests that revenue limits have 
worked: local own-source revenues have been reduced in 
the states that impose such limitations. Though there is 
some historical evidence that state legislatures in certain 
states have offset these limitations via state aid (Mullins 
and Joyce, 1996), revenue stick states tend to be far less 
generous in the allocation of intergovernmental revenue. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be constrained by 
their state context. 

Michigan, for instance, has a TEL score well above the 
most recent annual state average, coupled with slightly 
below average state aid. The problem with local fiscal 
sustainability in revenue stick states such as Michigan 
stems from local governments’ heightened reliance on 
state revenues, which in Michigan is a function of two 
large TEL ratchets and, in the post-Great Recession period, 
sharply declining property tax revenues. This high degree 
of dependency remains in place today. Yet, much like the 
way that Michigan’s Proposition A has exposed critical local 
education funding to state budgetary battles (Cullen and 
Loeb, 2004), the state’s unyielding property tax rate limits, 
coupled with special features of the Headlee Amendment 
that forbid the use of some alternative revenue sources 
employed in other states (e.g., income, sales and motor fuel 
taxes), have had the unfortunate side effect of essentially 
entwining local fiscal health with state legislative politics. 

As the state economy faltered under a one-state recession 
throughout much of the 2000s (Darga, 2011), the past 
decade has seen both clear declines in statutory revenue 
sharing and heightened levels of uncertainty over revenue- 
sharing rules (Lavelle, 2014, pp. 2-3). 

Michigan’s is a precarious fiscal context even for the most 
well-managed city government. It is particularly onerous 
for lawmakers in older, industrial cities such as Flint, 
which has been dealing for some time with sustained 
job and population loss, waning bureaucratic capacity, 
and increasingly daunting economic, social and physical 
challenges (see Doidge et al., 2015). In the words of one 
local official, if aid is reduced, “It’s not rocket science ... 
pretty much raise taxes or cut services. That’s what it boils 
down to” (McDermott and Powers, 2002, p. 12). Local 
lawmakers in a state such as Michigan, where they operate 



11 




with very limited discretion over revenue capacity, can boil 
it down even further: reduce or eliminate services or face 
the prospects of possible financial meltdown. All cities face 
political constraints on raising tax revenue. And certainly, 
some cities have managed their financial affairs in the face 
of economic decline better than others. However, for those 
seeking to fully grasp the nature of local fiscal health, we 
must continue to focus on ways in which states effectively 
create a mismatch between fiscal needs and available 
resources into their cities’ local fiscal decision-making 
environment.

In addition to the revenue squeeze that some states impose 
on their local governments, state governments also impose 
a range of expenditure-side pressures that can drive up 
local costs. 18 As state governments continue to streamline 
bureaucracies and downsize operations, service burdens 
have been shifted onto local governments, often “without 
careful consideration whether this was the correct 
course” (Gold and Wallin, 1999, p. 73). As one prominent 
National League of Cities report argues (2003, p. 23), the 
transference of “program responsibilities from state and 
federal government, as well as the imposition of state and 
federal mandates, increase the roles and responsibilities of 
municipal governments, often without corresponding fiscal 
capacity or authority.” Observers and analysts interested 
in the expenditure-side burdens that state policies place 
on local officials typically focus on the effects that costly 
mandates in areas such as health care and pollution 
abatement have on local government budgets (see Berman, 
2003, pp. 77-83). Far less attention is paid to what we might 
call de facto spending pressures - the hidden but potentially 
damaging state-level decisions, policies and institutions 
that can destabilize local governments’ fiscal capacity. 

Consider, as we do in this report, local governments’ large 
and increasing burden to pay for previously obligated 
labor costs. Labor costs, including wages and benefits 
for current employees as well as pensions and other 
postemployment benefits (OPEB) such as retiree healthcare, 
currently make up the largest category of operating costs 
for local governments. As pointed out in a recent MSU 
white paper (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013), municipalities 
were not required to measure the total costs of OPEB 
until an accounting standard was issued in 2004, with 
implementation beginning in 2007. Now that local 
governments have calculated and accounted for OPEB, 

18 This general phenomenon has been termed “second-order devolution” 

- meaning the transfer of program administration and/or substantive 
policy powers from the federal and state governments to America’s 
cities and municipalities (see Bowman and Kearney, 2011). 


many are faced with a massive commitment. Indeed, 

MSU’s review of Michigan cities facing severe fiscal stress 
revealed that each city was confronted with a substantial 
unfunded OPEB liability (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013). 

Though local government employee pensions and OPEB 
are seemingly always in the headlines, few seem to be 
asking why observers are more able to link labor costs 
to local fiscal distress in certain states than in others. 

Why do we hear so much about Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
California, Rhode Island and New Jersey? The answer, 
not surprisingly, is that, although city lawmakers are 
often criticized for overly cozy relationships with public 
employee labor unions (see, for instance, Gillette, 2014a; 
Rozansky, 2012; Greenhut, 2012), critical elements of 
employee benefit costs are structured by state law. State 
law may require bargaining by the employer, may provide 
only for a bargaining forum without requiring it or, 
alternatively, may simply prohibit collective bargaining 
altogether. State laws vary in the coverage of certain types 
of local employees. These rules address the types of items 
that may be bargained over, such as work rules, pay and 
benefits. Finally, the collective bargaining laws may include 
a process for dealing with impasses, such as binding 
arbitration rules. In line with the framework proposed 
at this report’s outset, we view the mix of these rules as a 
set of processes and constraints that directly influence a 
municipality’s fiscal capacity. 

Table 1 places the local public employee collective 
bargaining environment of the contiguous 48 states into a 
five-category classification scheme ranging from very weak 
to very strong. (See the research approach appendix for 
a more detailed explanation of this measure.) As Table 
1 makes plain, states vary with respect to the collective 
bargaining environment for local public employees. Not 
surprisingly, states with strong and very strong collective 
bargaining environments (e.g., those that impose a duty 
to bargain with strong union security provisions) have 
comparatively high union membership rates as well, 
with New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, 
Pennsylvania and Michigan each holding union membership 
rates in excess of 50 percent of state public employees. 
Unionization rates in weak and very weak states, such as 
Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, New Mexico, 
Wyoming, Utah, Georgia and Virginia, on the other hand, 
tend to fall around 10 percent. 19 

State laws concerning pensions and health benefits 
illustrate, in part, how state-imposed structures affect city 
expenditure choices. Yet recent attention to employee 
compensation, pension system funding/underfunding 
and, especially, the cumulative impact of local government 
employee costs on current municipal cash flows have 

19 Statistics from Union Membership and Coverage Database (see Hirsch 
and Macpherson, 2003). 


12 



brought these issues, in particular, into national focus. To 
be clear, we do not suggest that a non-unionized workforce 
is the key to a fiscally sustainable city. City governments 
must compete with other employers for workers, and 
rules governing bargaining are part of a state’s larger 
labor culture. Our simple argument is that, in light of the 
sizeable role for local labor costs in local budgeting as well 
the implementation of new accounting standards, city 
governments operating within states with more permissive 
collective bargaining provisions are more likely to face 
budgetary constraints. It is easy to pin these constraints 
on lousy decision making, yet these constraints owe much 
to higher labor costs and the cumulative costs of payment 
decisions that are, to a large degree, governed by state 
policy. 

C3) The Stale Context for Local 
Fiscal Distress^ Tension Between 
Hexenne and Expenditure Pressures 

Analysis of the interplay of revenue and expenditure 
pressures allows for a more detailed assessment of the 
nature of the fiscal context in which states place their 


local lawmakers. We offer this analysis as something of a 
corrective to the typical perception that a city’s financial 
destiny is either entirely within or entirely outside of its 
control. When assessing why certain local governments 
seem to respond more effectively to their financial problems 
than others, our research suggests that identifying on 
Figure 6 (see page 14) the state in which the city is located 
is a good place to start. The state’s coordinates represent 
an empirical measure of the state context for local fiscal 
distress - meaning the tension for local lawmakers between 
state- imposed revenue-side pressures (captured on the 
horizontal axis) and state-imposed expenditure-side 
pressures (captured on the vertical axis). 20 

20 More technically, the horizontal axis captures our measure of the 
revenue pressures that states inflict upon their local governments 
(standardized TEL severity score minus standardized average per 
capita aid score). The vertical axis represents a standardized measure 
of public employee union coverage, an approximation of the severity 
of the average city’s relatively fixed labor costs. The light gray 
shading represents the distance between one quartile above and one 
quartile below the median; thus states that appear outside these two 
intersecting ranges are quite different from average on both elements of 
the state context. Dark shaded points indicate state governments that 
authorize state intervention in financially distressed local governments.

If state-imposed revenue pressures increased with the 
severity of expenditure pressures, or vice versa, we would 
expect a positive “best fit” line (the dark curving line in 
Figure 6) moving from the lower left-hand quadrant to 
the upper right. As one might expect (or at least hope), 
these two elements of the state context tend to offset each 
other. States such as Colorado and New Mexico - i.e., 
more revenue stick states (local tax limitation increases 
outpace growth in the distribution of state aid) - avoid 
equally exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least when 
it comes to local labor costs. For states that do structure 
local collective bargaining in a way that favors higher local 
labor costs - such as New York, Connecticut and Rhode 
Island - these costs are at least partially offset by a more 
resilient and vibrant aid environment, coupled with limited 
own-source revenue restrictions. 

The relationship between these two elements of the state 
context is negative, but it is not a purely linear relationship. 
Figure 6’s most striking feature is its illustration that states 
placing extreme limitations on local revenue capacity 
(meaning they are more than one standard deviation 
above the state average on the horizontal axis) also tend to 
impose costly labor and service obligations (more than one 
standard deviation above the state average on the vertical 
axis). This relationship between revenue and expenditure 
pressures creates a best-fit line that resembles a backwards 
“J”. This small handful of states that pull the line upward 
- which include Michigan and California - cluster in the 
upper right-hand quadrant of Figure 6. It is no surprise 
that acute financial emergencies have clustered in these 
states. We contend that they have structured local fiscal 
policymaking in a way that effectively incubates financial 
distress. Table 2 classifies the states in an effort to clearly 
represent the position of each of the lower 48 states along 
these two dimensions. 


The threat of recurring structural deficits is “baked in” to 
the state-imposed legal and policy context in which local 
governments choose how to respond to fiscal problems. For 
lawmakers in America’s older, industrial cities who must 
operate within these states, that choice is often not theirs 
to make. As we point out above, these states apply revenue 
and expenditure pressures on the front end, while also 
fostering a fiscal environment that exacerbates fiscal stress, 
links local fiscal health to budgetary battles, and all in all 
restricts the policy “space” for local fiscal policymaking. 
Michigan, however, is the only state among the incubators 
in the top right quadrant of Table 2 and Figure 6 that also 
intervenes “on the back end” by assertively implementing 
one of the nation’s most powerful fiscal distress 
intervention policies (Anderson, 2011; Scorsone, 2014). 

In light of the clustering of distressed localities within 
Michigan’s borders, it comes as little surprise that Michigan 
lawmakers would value a policy that allows state officials 
to help struggling local governments meet conditions of 
chronic fiscal stress (Scorsone and Bateson, 2011; Doidge 
et al., 2015). However, as we discuss below, what is quite 
striking is the relationship between the policy’s goals and 
design - which favors state takeover of local government 
- and the nature and underlying causes of the problem 
of acute fiscal distress. The financial consequences of 
deep-rooted economic and social forces are unlikely to 
be fully alleviated via temporary suspension of local self- 
government. Neither are the often overlooked but critically 
important state-imposed causes analyzed above. In what 
follows, we survey the state governments with more holistic 
and self-aware views of local financial distress in an effort 
to draw important lessons for Michigan lawmakers as they 
continue to struggle with chronic fiscal stress among the 
state’s localities. 


Section 2: If Takeover is the Solution, then 
what is the Problem? What Michigan Can 
Learn from the Ways in Which Other States 
Tackle Problems of Local Fiscal Distress 


In the previous section, we make the case that state 
governments influence how local officials meet their 
financial problems via a combination of laws and policies 
that add or take away intergovernmental or own-source 
revenue capacity and drive up expenditure pressures 
via the allocation of policy authority over government 
functions and labor costs. In certain instances, such as 
when a state government caps property tax revenue and 
sets near insurmountable override standards, the effects 
of certain elements of the state context may be more or 
less direct. A city facing a near identical set of political, 
institutional, economic and social circumstances that 
operates in a neighboring state with no such revenue cap 
at least has the potential to capitalize on this capacity, 
assuming local political and economic constraints allow for 
the imposition of a property tax increase. But mostly the 
effects of this state context are more indirect. The policy 
balance between revenue restrictions and state aid, for 
instance, is not so much a direct measure of state policy 
choice as it is an outcome of a variety of state policy choices 
- e.g., revenue-sharing rules and formulae, the outcomes of 
citizen initiatives involving local TELs, legislative-executive 
budgetary processes, bureaucratic turf battles and so on. 

Since as far back as the late 19* century, when the 
proliferation of railroad bankruptcies prompted states 
to take action to assist struggling localities (see Dimock, 
1935 and 1940), state lawmakers, for fear that “a failing 
municipality will lower the credit rating of other localities 
and the state itself” (Berman, 2003, p. 113), have played a 
far more direct role in responding to local financial distress. 
The current menu of state policy options for intervening in 
distressed communities has been reviewed in two recent 
reports, one by Pew Charitable Trust researchers (Atwell et 
al., 2013) and a second by one of the authors of this report 
(Scorsone, 2014). One key shortcoming of these reports 
is the absence of detailed consideration of state context. 
Simply put, some states are part of the problem - they 
incubate financial distress via stringent restrictions on 
local revenue capacity and state policies precipitating local 
spending pressures. In other states, local policy options 
regarding the balance of revenue and expenditure flows are 
less encumbered by state policies and institutions. This 
diversity among state contexts is particularly important 
when reflecting on “best practices” for states dealing with 


acute local fiscal distress. For instance, close followers 
of issues of local finance often hear and read about North 
Carolina’s strong oversight and monitoring mechanisms 
as standards to which state governments should aspire 
(see, for instance, Mattoon, 2014). But does it make sense 
for a state such as Michigan or New Jersey, for instance, 
to adhere to similar policy principles when local fiscal 
policymaking is structured in such dramatically different 
ways? 

A second shortcoming of these reports is the dearth of 
detailed comparison among the 18 state governments that 
currently have an intervention policy. We refer readers 
to these reports for their quality in cataloguing the formal 
policy powers of state lawmakers on paper. Neither, 
however, is as useful at considering these policies in 
practice. This is a key tension in policy analysis generally 
and in instances of intervention in particular. The choice 
of the state’s appointed and elected officials to employ 
the power they have at their disposal and intervene in 
a distressed community (often meaning the temporary 
suspension of democratic processes) presents a particular 
type of implementation dilemma imbued with questions of 
racial bias, social and economic imbalances, and the legal 
and political culture that guides state-local relations. 

To fully assess the role of state governments in financial 
distress, we held a workshop for state government officials, 
analysts and experts with deep knowledge of state 
operations in local financial affairs. The Workshop on State 
Intervention in Distressed Communities, held in the fall 
of 2014 in Detroit, ultimately brought together a diverse 
group of 28 practitioners and policy experts from six states 
facing similar sets of local fiscal problems: Michigan, Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. 21 
The appendix provides a detailed overview of the structure 
of the event and the types of discussions that were held. 

Our primary goal was to provide a venue facilitating the 
open exchange of ideas and techniques for approaching the 
complicated problems facing cities in fiscal crisis. Indeed, 
as we discuss below, one recommendation of this research 

21 This portion of the process focused specifically on how states approach 
intervention. Though many of the participants in the workshop 
were intimately involved in making decisions at the city level, we 
intentionally chose participants representing the state perspective 
rather than that of local decision makers.

report is to continue to advance this and similarly minded 
endeavors as a means of facilitating what Peter May (1992) 
refers to as “instrumental policy learning,” which can 
improve state officials’ understanding of the benefits and 
limitations of particular policy approaches or administrative 
designs. A second goal centers on learning more about the 
states’ implementation processes for deciding whether to 
designate a city in distress, take it over temporarily or, in 
the most extreme cases, help shepherd its path to municipal 
bankruptcy. Our final goal was to investigate the types of 
“causal stories” (Stone, 2011) that state officials and experts 
used when considering the fiscal conditions facing their 
local governments. We held structured discussions about 
how the problem of local fiscal distress is defined (i.e., who 
or what bears the responsibility) and the ways in which 
state governments enshrine this problem definition via the 
design and implementation of financial emergency policies. 

In what follows, we begin with a brief outline of Michigan’s 
approach to local financial emergencies, paying special 
attention to linkages between the state’s policy solutions, 
the nature of fiscal stress in Michigan’s municipalities 
and the “front-end” context identified in Section 1. We 
then turn to alternative approaches employed in other key 
states. We begin with North Carolina, a state whose Local 
Government Commission, which administers the policy 
for dealing with financially challenged communities, has 
received a great deal of national credit. We then move 
to states facing more comparable sets of local conditions 
- i.e., with many older, industrial and fiscally vulnerable 
local governments suffering from population and job 
loss - that also have a history of state intervention in 
fiscally distressed communities. The goal here is not 
comprehensive overview. Rather, we set out to identify 
key dissimilarities with the new generation of intervention 
policies - of which Michigan’s current policy is the poster 
child - and to illustrate how state governments facing 
similar sets of challenges can more effectively align their 
policy regarding direct involvement in fiscally distressed 
communities with the nature of problems that these 
communities face, as well as with state-imposed constraints 
that hamper their capacity to balance revenue and 
expenditure flows. 

We designed Table 3 (see page 18) to help guide this 
discussion. The first two columns summarize the state 
context analyzed in Section 1 of this report. The four 
rightmost columns depict information summarizing the 
design and administration of the state’s local financial 
emergency policy. The column labeled “causal story” 
reflects our assessment of how a state government, via its 
legislation of state intervention, comes down on the debate 
over the causes of local financial failure. For some states, 
the focal point is internal causes - poor management, the 
incompetence of local leaders, political corruption, the 
dominance over policymaking by narrow interests, and/or 


“antidemocratic” structures and processes that favor the 
whims of local officials over the needs of local residents 
(Gillette, 2014b). Other states focus on forces external to 
local management - i.e., socioeconomic conditions that 
are at once causes and symptoms of diminishing local 
service capacity and resources (see Kimhi, 2008), such 
as high and concentrated poverty, older building stocks, 
residential vacancies, high crime, deep-rooted regional 
changes, population loss and job loss. The column labeled 
“policy approach” captures the gist of the state’s approach 
to financially distressed communities and reinforces the 
causal theory behind the policy’s design. We also include 
information on the administration of the states’ policies. 
Here the focus is on the powers of key administrative actors 
and their bureaucratic location. In line with a great deal of 
research on policy analysis and the policymaking process, 
we structure Table 3 in a way that suggests that key state 
decisions on goals, administration and implementation flow 
from how responsibility for the problem is assigned - i.e., 
the causal story (see Stone, 2011, p. 206). This information 
is provided for the six states that were represented at the 
Detroit workshop - Michigan, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio - as well as for North 
Carolina, a state that frequently gains attention for the 
effectiveness of its intervention policy. 

CD Michigan's Local Financial 
Stability and Choice Actt A Brave 
New World for State Intervention 

The tenets of Michigan’s intervention policy have been 
well-documented in research reports and news media. 

After the governor declares a fiscal emergency, 22 four 
possible courses of action are available to a municipality, 23 
though local takeover by an emergency manager (EM) is 
the most common course of action. This allows a state- 
appointed manager to “act for and in the place and stead 
of the governing body and the office of chief administrative 
officer of the local government” and effectively grants this 
individual powers beyond those available to local officials. 24 
Not only does he or she become responsible for all local 
fiscal decisions, including development and implementation 
of a recovery plan (which must be approved by the state 
treasurer), but the EM can also modify existing collective 
bargaining agreements, negotiate new union contracts and 
make personnel changes. The EM can also explore the 
option of consolidating services with another government 
entity, sell municipal assets and ask voters to increase the 
tax rate. The EM remains in this role until the city reaches 
certain benchmarks within its recovery plan, and a

receivership transition board is appointed by the governor 
to assist in transition until the official termination of 
receivership. 

The structure of Michigan’s successive intervention laws 
and the powers granted to the emergency manager point 
to a particular type of causal story - local government 
mismanagement as the chief barrier to fiscal solvency. The 
state’s solutions and assistance all center on correcting 
local decisions that led to chronic budget shortfalls, and 
the main focus of Michigan’s law, which is administered by 
the Department of Treasury, is to ensure a balanced budget. 
Efforts to achieve short-term fiscal solvency typically center 
on reductions in cities’ financial obligations - e.g., cutting 
pension obligations, making personnel cuts and contracting 
out services traditionally provided by local governments. 
EMs and other state officials have little leeway to affect the 
revenue side of local governments’ ledgers. As Anderson 
(2011, p. 620) argues, the viewpoint being expressed by the 
design and implementation of Michigan’s policy is “that the 
current revenue picture of the city is adequate to provide 
for public safety, debt service, and other core expenses — if 
only ... the city had competent management.” Indeed, little 
or no financial support accompanies state takeover. This 
is a telling feature of the state law that sheds considerable 
light on both the degree to which the policy oversimplifies 
the causes of local fiscal distress and the mismatch between 
the administrator’s toolkit and the nature of the problem. 

To respond to the question at the outset of this section: if 
takeover is the solution, the problem is mismanagement. 
Michigan codifies this causal story in a way that is less 
adulterated than in any other state we have surveyed. In 
other words, the state has adopted and codified a vastly 
oversimplified story. Even Rhode Island, which granted 
similarly sweeping powers to its state-appointed emergency 
managers, offers additional assistance to cities approaching 
distress to help prevent full-fledged crises. The state 
has also seen EMs (called “receivers”) raise local taxes 
to generate more local revenue. This less than favorable 
assessment of Michigan’s policy is buttressed by the 
absence of emergency bailout funding, a traditional feature 
of the more aggressively implemented state intervention 
policies (Berman, 1995; Anderson, 2011), as well as meager 
revenue-raising powers. EMs are empowered to tackle 
city expenditures as a means of bringing local budgets into 
equilibrium, but revenue-raising powers are effectively 
more limited than the powers normally afforded a city’s 
mayor or council member. As has been pointed out 
elsewhere, for cities such as Flint, Ecorse, Benton Harbor 
and Pontiac, this is a gross oversimplification of the 
structural barriers to fiscal sustainability (Doidge et al., 
2015). Our aim in this report is not to disprove the notion 
that mismanagement is the cause. We merely point out that 
the policy’s design and implementation features devalue 
the considerable constraints that the state places on the 
revenue capacity of local officials. 


C2) Ttte Limited Applicability of 
ss B@st Practices**” Why Adoption of 
North €ar©IIna*s Policies Won*t Work 
for Michigan 

The reentry of Michigan’s cities into emergency 
management and the number of local governments and 
school districts in trouble have led to suggestions that 
Michigan should look elsewhere for answers. 25 A Pew 
Center on the States report suggests that North Carolina’s 
monitoring system has prevented fiscal distress despite a 
history of crises during the Great Depression and some of 
highest unemployment rates in the country (Pew Charitable 
Trusts, 2013). 

The Local Government Commission, a division of the North 
Carolina Treasury Department, reviews cities’ independent 
audits on key fiscal health indicators, particularly the 
level of fund balance. If a locality fails to meet a specific 
threshold, it is placed on the commission’s watch report 
and required to submit a plan of improvement. If local 
officials are unable to return the municipality to an 
acceptable level on their own, the commission assumes 
control of all local financial decisions, including taxing 
issues, until the problem is corrected. Additionally, the 
commission approves and sells all local bonds for public 
structure investments, which both increases the level 
of state oversight and reduces the potential for local 
mismanagement of debt. Bond agencies assign a premium 
to this monitoring system, considering it a model system 
(Coe, 2007). 

Features of North Carolina’s approach provide intriguing 
options for Michigan lawmakers, such as a codified, 
professional state office and extensive front-end monitoring 
to identify potential crises. However, evaluating these 
policies in isolation - i.e., in the absence of key contextual 
factors - is likely to overstate the potential success of North 
Carolina’s policies if they were to be enacted in Michigan. 

For instance, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2007, 
North Carolina had 548 municipalities, no other local 
general-purpose governments and 100 counties; Michigan 
had 533 cities and villages (municipalities), 1,242 townships 
and 83 counties. A consequence of Michigan having three 
times as many local governments as North Carolina is that 
the volume of reports that would need to be reviewed 
for monitoring purposes would be three times as great. 26 
Certainly this would require more resources devoted to 
oversight at the state level, thus putting additional stress on 
the state budget. 

The states differ greatly on other dimensions of the 
elements of state context identified in Section I. North 

25 http://www.crcmich.org/PUBLICAT/2000s/2000/memol053.pdf. 

26 This does not include the additional resources that would be required 
to monitor school districts, special districts or other governmental 
units. 


19 



Carolina has an obligatory state pension system; Michigan 
does not. In 1947, North Carolina declared it illegal for 
local governments to bargain with unions. 27 Conversely, 
Michigan’s local governments have a strong history of 
collective bargaining and excluded police and fire unions 
from 2012’s right-to-work legislation. Tax and expenditure 
limits, when averaged from 1970 through 2005, rank 
Michigan as the third most restrictive state in limits placed 
on local governments. North Carolina is 38 th - a property 
tax rate limit on counties and municipalities, set in 1973, 
has remained its only TEL. 

The differences in the state policy context between the 
two states suggest that Michigan should be cautious 
when drawing lessons from North Carolina as its model 
for intervention policies. We attribute North Carolina’s 
success in preventing municipalities from entering distress 
not to the design of its specific intervention policy but 
rather to a much tighter link between its policy approach 
and the state-imposed context for fiscal distress. 

C3) Hebyildlng State-Leeai 
Partnerships" ICey Insights 
from Piiede island* New jersey* 
Pennsylvania* Mew Yorlc and Ohio 

One of the more striking findings to emerge from our 
workshop and subsequent research is the difference 
between Michigan’s approach to local fiscal distress and 
the approaches of comparably situated state governments. 
These differences are laid bare in Table 3. Plainly put, state 
policies and institutions effectively incubate budgetary 
imbalances; yet lawmakers and administrators have ignored 
potential front-end damage when designing the policy 
aimed at helping communities in distress. Rhode Island, 
the state most comparable to Michigan in the priorities 
of its intervention policy and the powers granted to state 
receivers, also provides financial assistance to municipalities 
most in need, targeting aid to communities with a high 
property tax burden relative to taxpayer wealth through the 
state’s Distressed Communities Relief Fund thus buttressing 
the revenue capacity of its local governments. 28 With 
respect to this specific aspect of state context, Rhode Island 
generally provides higher levels of state aid. 

New Jersey and Pennsylvania: A More 
Comprehensive View of Local Financial 
Failure 

Beyond Rhode Island, Michigan lawmakers have a variety of 
states from which to learn about the viability of policy 


27 N.C. Gen. Stat. 95-78 to 84 (http://www.nrtw.org/right-work-states-

28 Established in 1990. Municipalities that fall in the bottom 20 percent 
of three of the law’s four indices qualify to receive state aid under the 
law. In the 2014 fiscal year, seven municipalities received funding

alternatives. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have enacted 
receivership laws that are quite different than Michigan and 
Rhode Island. Internal mismanagement is not eschewed 
entirely; rather it is considered alongside the external, 
structural dynamics with which local lawmakers must 
contend. This more holistic causal story both reinforces 
and is reinforced by choices that these states have made 
regarding implementation and administration. 

New Jersey’s policy of assisting cities during times of 
financial crisis originated in the Great Depression. Since 
that time, the state has built support within its bureaucracy 
to review and approve city budgets and offer financial 
and technical assistance as needed to prevent cities from 
entering bankruptcy. Rather than appointing a state- 
level official to take charge of a city' s finances (such as an 
emergency manager in Michigan), 29 Newjersey seeks to 
assist local officials in alleviating distress. This partnership 
is reflected in the mission statement of the Newjersey 
Division of Local Government Services (DLGS), a division 
of the Department of Community Affairs. It states that 
the DLGS “serves as an advocate for local Government 
interests,” provides assistance and is responsible for 
“financial integrity.” The DLGS provides advisory services 
to local governments, both once the community is identified 
as distressed and on request of the municipality, and also 
licenses and educates local officials. 

Not surprisingly, these two services help establish a 
partnership between state and local officials independent 
of the financial position of the municipality. The state 
requires that all local government budgets and certain 
financing and purchases be approved by state agencies. 30 
The budget review is conducted by department staff 
members (many hired short-term annually) and is made 
easier for local units of government by state-provided 
training and consistent reporting requirements. When 
these preventive actions fail to ward off systemic financial 
issues, the state begins a more involved intervention. The 
community is first placed on a watch list, at which point 
the state generally channels additional monetary aid to the 
struggling government. The state also uses its Qualified 
Bond Act Program, which requires state approval to bond or 
make capital expenditures, to ensure stability and prevent 
default. This program can capture and stall state aid for 
payment of debt services. At the same time, DLGS offers 
technical assistance to cities to help them solve underlying 
problems that contribute to fiscal distress. 

The most notable example is the consolidation of the 
Camden police force in 2010. The mayor terminated the 
entire city police force and contracted with the county 
to provide those services, with the guidance and support 


29 Until recently, when Atlantic City was declared to be in fiscal distress 
and an emergency manager was appointed. 

30 Procurements over $5 million must be reviewed by the comptroller, 
and those over $10 million must be directly approved. 



of state officials. 31 Camden illustrates the cooperative 
efforts of various levels and sectors of the state and local 
governments. It highlights that preventive efforts to 
maintain or restore fiscal sustainability are not always 
sufficient, but that a collaborative approach can assist cities 
and the state through difficult political decisions. New 
Jersey’s approach indicates that the state views itself in 
partnership with local governments, with a responsibility 
to provide a check on risky financial decisions but also 
to provide ongoing financial assistance to struggling 
communities. 

In contrast to New Jersey’s hesitance to use direct state 
control, Pennsylvania’s Act 47 allows the state to place 
fiscally distressed communities in receivership under the 
direction of the Center for Local Government Services in 
the Department of Community and Economic Development. 
Once a municipality has been placed under receivership, 
local government officials must have the majority of their 
decisions confirmed by the receiver, and the receivership 
board may implement cost-saving or revenue-raising 
strategies unavailable to local officials. The board has the 
ability to raise taxes above the legal maximum but has no 
additional powers in collective bargaining. Principally, 
the receiver acts as a liaison between the local government 
and others to improve the financial integrity of the city and 
is typically able to broker additional state funding for the 
distressed community. In Harrisburg’s recent financial 
descent, for instance, the receiver was able to facilitate $25 
million of revenue to fund a non-profit that would provide 
infrastructure and economic development. 

Receivers in Pennsylvania tend to take a comprehensive 
view of local financial difficulties as they work with the 
state to look for alternative partnerships and unique 
revenue-enhancing and cost-sharing schemes. Proposed 
financial recovery plans often include recommendations 
that will improve local governments’ economic positions 
in the future. This approach extends through the process 
of recovery. It requires more research, more interactions 
and coordination between parties, and more time to allow 
for business adjustments and industrial reorganization. 
Furthermore, it includes a period of weaning cities off the 
additional funding to which they had access during their 
most trying times. To officially exit Act 47, cities must 
follow an extensive process that includes hearings and the 
department director’s signature. As a result, Pennsylvania 
has had only seven of 28 distressed communities officially 
conclude the process. Allowing cities to remain in a 
system with additional structure and support illustrates 
Pennsylvania’s acknowledgement that factors outside of 
local control contribute to fiscal issues, and that the state 
has some role in providing additional support. 

31 Returning to the role of other state policies in distress solutions, this 
action would not have been possible without particular provisions 
within union and employee contracts that allowed for such termination 
of individual employees. 


In all, intervention policies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania 
are administered by state agencies dedicated to working 
with local governments. State personnel are involved 
with municipalities well before distress, and they have 
resources and authority to assist municipalities. Though 
administrators are afforded the statutory authority to 
assume greater control over city finances, this is not the 
only facet of their relationship with local governments. 

New York and Ohio: The Benefits of 
Monitoring 

Similar to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, New York 
has established a system that supports state and local 
cooperation and information sharing. As local fiscal 
crisis deepens, the state becomes more involved in 
local political and operational affairs. The state’s policy 
approach to local fiscal emergencies is ad hoc\ (rather 
than multijurisdictional), allowing lawmakers to survey 
the specific causes of distress for a given community and 
legislate solutions in line with these problems. 

As is well-documented, New York’s history of fiscal 
intervention begins with New York City’s near bankruptcy 
in 1975. Naturally, a crisis of that magnitude spurred state 
action, but since that time, New York has not been plagued 
by chronic distress. This is due in part to cities’ ability 
to increase revenues without legal restriction (until 2014, 
when the state imposed a cap on property tax increases). 
Additionally, many New York communities have avoided 
the economic peril that results from a loss of major 
industries and subsequent economic restructuring. 32 This 
history is evident in the state’s view of municipal distress 
as an unusual and unique instance that requires customized 
solutions. New York provides gradual intervention and 
individualized approaches to distress, with the decisions 
and the process supervised by state elected officials - the 
governor, the legislature and the comptroller. 

In addition to customized intervention approaches to 
distressed cities - which could violate the constitutions 
of states that disallow special legislation - New York is 
also heavily involved in monitoring the fiscal position of 
its local governments. The state’s Local Government and 
School Accountability (LGSA) unit of the Office of the State 
Comptroller operates the Fiscal Stress Monitoring System, 
which reviews annual financial data of local governments to 
determine whether each government is facing significant, 
moderate or probable fiscal stress. Municipalities must 
submit audit reports, which are reviewed and in some 
cases conducted by approximately 200 auditors. 33 From 
annual reports, budgets and audits, the LGSA creates 
local fiscal measures for benchmarking, trend analysis and 

32 Buffalo was an exception and did necessitate intervention proceedings. 
It should be noted that Buffalo is one of only four New York local 
governments responsible for operating its own school district. 

33 These 200 employees review audit reports of school districts and other 
local governments as well as municipalities. 



general monitoring over time and across local government 
types. State auditors are also deployed to work with local 
governments. As a result, state officials may use knowledge 
of community nuances in evaluating local deviations 
from sound fiscal indicators and state trends. Such 
specialization is particularly useful as state intervention 
becomes necessary. 34 

If a local government is identified as financially unsound, 
the state must pass special legislation to institute a local 
control board for the municipality to engage in the formal 
intervention process. After a local control board is created, 
primary authority over the struggling municipality is 
transferred from the comptroller’s office to the governor' 
appointed board. 

Each board, by the nature of the process, has different 
powers. Previous boards have overseen proposed local 
budgets and set personnel policy, and were granted the 
final authority to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 35 That 
the boards have had no additional taxing authority, ability 
to renegotiate previous collective bargaining agreements 
nor authority to make unilateral budget decisions reflects 
the state’s emphasis on local autonomy. 

The boards have been particularly useful in coordinating 
intergovernmental solutions. For instance, the Buffalo 
Fiscal Stability Authority (BFSA) was established in 2003. 

It helped Buffalo manage its additional school district 
responsibility and restructured the city’s pension and 
health insurance plans by joining the respective state- 
level systems. Finally, the BFSA brokered an arrangement 
for city parks to be managed at the county level and for 
16 libraries to close. Despite the local knowledge and 
intergovernmental efforts, it took nearly nine years for 
Buffalo to exit receivership and for the BFSA to transition 
into an advisory role. Policy specifies that the BFSA will 
serve in this role until 2037, and the city may revert to full 
receivership if financial indicators show distress. 

At the state level, New York vests its relationship with 
local governments and the power to intervene in elected 
officials - the governor, the comptroller and the legislature. 
This separates the state’s ongoing monitoring from its 
intervention, and though it raises the legislative barrier 
to intervention by requiring the crafting and passage of 
legislation, it also provides public accountability and a 
system of checks and balances. The ability to draft city- 
specific solutions allows New York to address management 
issues, economic conditions and the impacts of the state 

34 Ultimately, any distressed community implements solutions that are 
specific to its condition. A universal policy prescription is to reduce 
expenditures. However, no universal prescription can be made 

on what account specifically should be limited and in what way. 
Knowledge of exact inefficiencies, redundancies, slack and so forth is 
necessary to act. If outside agents are to advise on such actions, their 
already having some knowledge of the particulars of the city will allow 
for more expedient and implementable recommendations.

context in different ways in each city, ideally assisting the 
community to long-term stability. 

Ohio, like New York, faced a fiscal crisis in its largest city 
in the 1970s. Cleveland’s default on short-term notes in 
1978, which made it the first municipality to default since 
the Great Depression, led Ohio to develop a comprehensive 
policy designed to prevent and, if necessary, intervene 
in distressed cities (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2013; Levine, 
Scorsone and Justice, 2013). No municipality has defaulted 
since Cleveland, but Toledo, East Cleveland and other 
municipalities have entered fiscal emergency status, 
particularly once the Great Recession exacerbated declining 
revenue bases and expenditure pressures. 

Ohio’s Local Government Services Division, located in the 
state auditor’s office, is responsible for training local officials 
and auditing local budgets. Chapter 118 of the state code, 36 
which deals with local fiscal emergencies, grants the Local 
Government Services Division (the auditor) responsibility 
for categorizing distressed communities for fiscal caution, 
fiscal watch or fiscal emergency. The categorization system 
signals to local officials, bondholders and other stakeholders 
the extent of the local government’s fiscal stress and the 
ease of financial recovery anticipated. It serves as a useful 
continuum of distress, recognizing that failing to pass one 
indicator of financial soundness may not require the same 
actions as a community failing multiple triggers. Each category 
has an increasing level of oversight (i.e., requirements for audit 
depth and financial plan proposals). Once fiscal emergency is 
declared, an advisory board is created. 

Under all three distress categories, local governments are 
required to submit recovery plans to the Local Government 
Services Division. If a local government is not compliant 
with its recovery plan, the only penalty is movement 
to a higher designation of fiscal distress. It is not until 
a municipality reaches the fiscal emergency status that 
penalties are imposed. 

As part of the fiscal emergency proceedings, municipal 
officials must submit a recovery plan to the recovery 
board for approval. If a plan is not submitted or the local 
government fails to adhere to a plan, the Office of Budget 
and Management is supposed to suspend all state funding 
to that municipality, 37 though this penalty has never been 
fully enforced.

(pdf). The state’s approach is consistent with the autonomy allowed 
Ohio’s local governments. Section 118.02 (B) of the state code states 
that, “[t]he intention...is to enact procedures, provide powers, and 
impose restrictions ...while leaving principal responsibility for the 
conduct of the affairs...in the charge of its duly elected officials.” The 
effort to maintain local autonomy is demonstrated by the fact that the 
review process of the Local Government Services Division is initiated 
by request of local officials as well as at the suggestion of auditors. 

37 Although individuals receiving direct state welfare within the 
community’s borders continue to do so. 




Ohio, like other states, struggles with assisting 
communities to achieve permanent fiscal stability. The city 
of East Cleveland was under fiscal emergency for 18 years. 
Exiting the process failed to mark long-term sustainable 
success - East Cleveland was once again placed under 
fiscal emergency. In late 2014, it was considering entering 
into bankruptcy proceedings, 38 and the city’s mayor filed a 
petition seeking a merger with the city of Cleveland in the 
summer of 2015. 39

Ohio, like Michigan, illustrates the issues that arise when 
a state’s solution (intervention policy) does not match the 
causes of distress (context). Local officials retain control of 
decision making and the plan to resolve distress, but they 
and the state agency responsible for intervention lack the 
authority or resources to address the root causes of distress 
or to circumvent the pressures that the mix of state policies 
adds to local fiscal policymaking processes.

Section 3: Conclusions and 
Recommendations 


In the previous sections we identified the ways that broad 
state policies limit or enhance the local governing options 
and the ways that states with intervention policies match 
their approach to local financial distress with the reality 
of city operating environments. Here we conclude our 
analysis with conclusions and practical recommendations 
to assist the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
approach to local fiscal crises. 

CIIJ Conciysions 

There is no single model policy for state intervention 
in distressed cities or for prevention of fiscal distress. 
Changing Michigan’s fiscal intervention law to replicate 
that of another state would likely provide little 
improvement for Flint or other cities facing fiscal crises. 
There is no “best practice” for state intervention in cities. 
What Michigan can learn from other states and our research 
is that removing and repairing mismanagement addresses 
only one cause of fiscal distress. Bringing a structurally 
imbalanced budget back into balance is an important step 
to assist cities like Flint, but a policy that does not address 
a state’s unique system of revenue, tax and expenditures, 
and labor policies may not help cities truly escape financial 
trouble over the long term. States must decide which legal 
and political tradeoffs they are willing to make to support 
city fiscal health. Michigan must also recognize that, in 
comparison with similar states, it provides a particularly 
difficult environment for its cities. 

Municipal fiscal distress is not just a local problem. State 
policy choices set the boundaries for local action and the 
conditions under which cities receive assistance. It is not 
surprising that these conclusions do not point to simple 
solutions, executable at the local level. Changing any one 
part of the state context is politically challenging, and it 
would be impractical to recommend major policy overhauls 
of Proposal A, the Headlee Amendment, collective 
bargaining rules and state revenue sharing. Ideally, 
Michigan would adopt a more balanced approach to its 
local governments’ fiscal needs, but we are aware that this 
is unlikely in the short term because of both political will 
and the high barriers to changing constitutionally enshrined 
rules. Instead, we offer recommendations that balance 
improvements that would better support cities in fiscal 
distress with political feasibility. 

Mec@mmenoaii©iis 

Create a state agency that coordinates services to local 
governments and offers technical support and fiscal 


monitoring. Establishing a formal place within state 
government that is responsible for ongoing, cooperative 
work with local governments on fiscal stability and other 
issues would help create a partnership and culture of trust 
between the state and its municipalities. The Department 
of Treasury does provide some of these services on an 
individual basis via the Office of Fiscal Responsibility 
(OFR), but the OFR does not have the resources necessary 
to provide a comprehensive system of support to all of the 
state’s local governments. 

It is important that whatever agency is created be 
empowered with human resources to sufficiently provide 
service; financial resources, separate from the state’s 
revenue sharing to local governments, to offer special 
assistance where needed to communities facing challenges 
or distress; and a position within the state departmental 
structure that allows it to be taken seriously when 
recommending policy and working with other departments 
to assist local governments. The examples of offices in 
the other states in our study may provide elements of 
the agency’s design, but the office should be built with 
Michigan’s particular context and culture in mind. It may 
be appropriate to expand the OFR in its current position, 
but moving the office to another department, establishing 
it as a stand-alone agency and other potential structures 
should be evaluated as well. 

Raise awareness among citizens and state decision makers 
that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at the local 
level. Flint is an example that can illustrate this point as 
the C.S. Mott Foundation and city leaders communicate 
with the public and state officials. As the city emerges from 
state control, the budget is balanced for the short term, 
and the transition advisory board is in place to monitor 
management and compliance with the plan. Yet revenue 
projections show the city likely facing a structural deficit 
in the next five years with little available to cut from the 
budget. State control has reasonably removed management 
problems as the cause of deficits, yet the city’s fiscal 
health remains precarious. A focused communications 
effort highlighting the combined effects of Michigan’s 
expenditure, revenue and labor policies could help broaden 
the discussion of fiscal distress in the state and create 
awareness that this is more than a local problem. Rather 
than being the exception, Flint may be the harbinger of 
what is to come for Michigan’s local governments without 
changes at the state level.

State aid and TEL z scores were calculated

deviations a score is from the average.) 

The aid measure is per capita state aid in 
real 2005 dollars for cities with populations 
over 5,000. The TEL measure is the TEL se- 
ver ;y score described above. These scores 
were then differenced (Aid_z minus TEL_z 
m Figure 5; TEL_z minus Aid_z for Figure 6 
and Table 2) to create the distance mea- 
sure, The values displayed are the average 
distances from 2000 through 2005. Carrot 
states are 1.5 standard deviations above the 
mean difference; stick states are 1.5 stan- 
dard deviations below the mean difference.

Introduction 


The city of Flint, Michigan, has experienced a variety of fiscal 
difficulties since the early 2000s. In. 2002, an emergency 
financial manager was appointed for the city under Public 
Act 72 of 1990 and was in place until 2004. Unfortunately, 
the reforms and changes made at that time only lasted for 
a few years before fiscal problems re-emerged in Flint (see

II. Historical Overview of Flint, Michigan 


Examining the history of Flint can provide an. 
understanding of the evolution of the chronic fiscal stress 
that has plagued the. city, as well as its significance in the 
geographic region. The city of Flint is located in Genesee 
County, about 60 miles northwest of Detroit. The Flint 
River provided the natural, resources to create successful 
commerce in the 1800s for fur trading, the lumber industry, 
the manufacture of carriages, and eventually the production 
of horseless carriages that led to the birth of the automotive 
industry. The entrepreneurial spirit and wealth in the area 
contributed to the founding of the Buick Motor Company 
in .1903, followed by the incorporation of General Motors 
(GM) in 1908. With the rapid growth of the automotive 
industry came concerns for employee working conditions. 
This led to the first automotive sit-down strike in 1936-1937 
in Flint. After 44 days, the strike ended with the first union 
agreement with GM, which gave rise to the United. Auto 
Workers (UAW). The continued improvements in working 
conditions and wages enabled Flint to become an ideal 
place to live and work, and the increase in wealth fostered 
a well-respected educational system. Early automotive 
industry leaders such as Charles Stewart Mott and William 
C. Durant provided the vision to create a strong cultural 
environment. Flint prospered for most of the years from 
the 1930s into the early 1970s. Like many industrial cities, 
however, the economic vibrancy ebbed and flowed with 
the U.S. automotive industry. In 1978, GM employed 


over 80,000 Flint-area residents. By 1990, the number of 
employees decreased to 23,000, dipping to as low as 8,000 
in 2006.

The City of Flint was incorporated in 1855. The present 
charter, adopted in 1974, provides for a strong mayor- 
council form of government. The city council consists of 
nine members, each representing a ward and serving four- 
year terms. The mayor, also elected to a four-year term, 
is the chief executive officer. The mayor appoints a city 
administrator, as well as principal officials and department 
heads. 

The City' of Flint: provides a full range of services across 
32.8 square miles, including: police and fire protection, 
construction and maintenance of streets and infrastructure, 
recreational and cultural activities, water and sewer 
services, and sanitation and garbage pickup services. In 
addition, the City of Flint is financially accountable for four 
other entities: 

► City of Flint Board of Hospital Managers (manages and 
operates the Hurley Medical. Center providing inpatient, 
outpatient, and emergency care) 

> Flint Downtown Development Authority (promotes 
rehabilitation of the downtown area) 


Z 



> City of Flint Economic Development Corporation (provides financing and 
development opportunities for businesses located in the City) 

* Flint Area Enterprise Community 4 5 (coordinates the federal enterprise and 
helps to leverage the resources for the zone) 

Flint is the county seat for Genesee County. Like most counties in Michigan, the 
county government provides court services, human services, record keeping, and 
community enrichment for its residents. The. county and its elected officials also 
serve as regional problem solvers.

The city of Flint’s population has changed drastically over the past 50 years. 

This section explores the historical changes that have occurred throughout the 
city and region. These trends are essential for explaining the path that has led to 
Flint’s fiscal distress and may point to the path that the city may need to follow 
in order to build a sustainable future. 


According to data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the 
city of Flint has declined over five consecutive decades. There were 48% fewer 
residents in the city in 2010 compared to 1960 (Exhibit 11-1). In 2012, there were 
100,515 s residents in the city; in 2013 the city’s estimated population further 
declined to 99,758 6 . 

In contrast, the population trends in the Flint metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA), defined by Genesee County boundaries, indicate enormous growth 
through, the 1970s with slight declines over the following three decades. This 
indicates that the Flint metropolitan statistical area has experienced significant: 
decentralization.

Exhibit U-2 more clearly illustrates this decentralization. In 1940, the city of 
Flint comprised 66% of the population of the Flint MSA population compared 
to only 24% in 20.13. The estimates from the 20B American Community Survey 
indicate that the net migration into the suburbs may be starting to stabilize, 
though Flint’s population has continued to decline in recent years.

To see this more clearly, Exhibit H-4 shows the relative share of each age 
category in the total population for each year. The share of population aged 19 
years old and under generally increased from .1.940 to 1970 with the Baby Boom 
and has since continually declined from its peak of 41% in 1970. to only 29% of 
the population in 2013. The share of individuals aged 20 to 34 has fluctuated over 
the last seven decades, but has been on a general decline since 1980. The share 
of population aged 35 to 64 years old experienced a period of contraction from 
1950 to 1980 followed by a continuous period of growth since then, likely due to 
the aging of the Baby Boomer population. Finally, during the past, seven decades, 
there, has been a fairly steady expansion of residents aged 65 and. over, probably 
due to increased life expectancy. This demographic is expected to continue to 
expand with the aging of the Baby Boomer population. 

The racial distribution of the city has also changed since the 1940s, as shown in 
Exhibit iI-5. The city has become more diverse with a population that is 39% 
white and 56% bl a ck/A fri ca r; -Am erican in 2012 compared to 95.6% white and 
4% black/African-American in 1940. The share of the population in the “Other” 
category, which includes both individuals of other races and multi-racial 
individuals, has also grown from 0.1% in 1940 to 6% in 2010.

Housing trends also help tell the story of a city that is facing fiscal stress. The 
rate, of housing vacancy increased from 5.1% in 1970 to 25.4 % in 2013 (Exhibit 
11-8). The rate of change in vacancy was highest between 2000 and 2013 with 
a 13 percentage-point increase. This coincides with Michigan’s decade of 
economic decline. The potential impact of increased housing vacancies on fiscal 
health include not only decline in property values and associated property 
tax revenues, but also increased municipal maintenance, police patrol, fire 
protection, and other costs to address health and human safety concerns.' 

Home ownership is also associated with the strength of a community’s property 
values. In 2013, owner-occupied housing only comprised 57% of occupied 
housing units compared to 73% of units at its peak over the last seven decades 
in 1960. However, the rate of owner-occupied housing in 2013 is a slight increase 
from its value in 2010, perhaps a small sign of recovery for the city of Flint 
(Exhibit 81-7).

Given these trends, it is no surprise that property values in the Flint area have 
declined drastically since the Great Recession as shown in Exhibit US. The 
state equalized value (SEV) and the taxable value (TV) have almost converged as 
of 2015. This could be attributed to a combination of falling property values and 
the “pop-up” effect of the transfer of ownership of property due to Proposal A 
(which will be discussed in more detail in section IV). Since local governments 
tend to rely heavily on property taxes for revenue, this is another indicator of the 
declining tax base of the city. 


The trends in the jobless rate in the city of Flint and Flint MSA tend to follow 
the same pattern as that of Michigan as a whole (Exhibit Ii-9). The jobless rate 
rose during the 2001 recession and did not see sustained recovery until after the 
Great Recession ended in 2009; however, absolute unemployment rates tend to 
be higher in the city compared to the MSA and the state as a whole. While there 
has been a drop in unemployment in the city of Flint since the end of the Great 
Recession, it is still higher (14% in 2014) than pre-2001 recession levels (8% in 
2000 ).

The city of Flint’s audit reports disclosed the city’s personal income statistics 
as shown in Exhibit li-10. While a slight recovery occurred after the 2001 
recession, in general, personal income has been on a long-term decline since 
1996, indicating a diminishing tax base. A decline in personal income not only 
indicates a lower capacity for property tax and income tax. revenues, but also 
suggests a relation to a lower demand for business-type services. If this demand 
is fairly elastic with respect to personal income, this would lead to a reduction in 
city income from public recreation programs, parking fees, and similar sources. 
The decline in personal income began leveling off in 2009, suggesting signs of 
stabilization following Michigan’s decade in recession. 

While the economic climate in the 1990s and 2000s worsened the city of Flint’s 
employment: and income trends, many decades of above average poverty rates 
signal long-term fiscal stress. Exhibit 18-11 shows the general growth in the 
share of total population living below the poverty level, which peaked at 41.2% 
in 2010. The share of families below the poverty level follows the population 
trend. Poverty rates reported by the 2012 American Community Survey indicate

a possible improvement since 2010, which also coincides with the improvements 
in unemployment; and income, discussed above. If the unemployment 
and income trends are indeed indicative of economic recovery, then these 
improvements in poverty statistics are possibly explained by a countercyclical, 
relationship between poverty and the business cycle. 

Exhibit I M2 depicts the cumulative change in the number of nonfarm, jobs 
in the city of Flint, the Flint: MSA, and Michigan as a whole. While the state 
overall saw a period of growth in employment in the mid-1990s, employment 
in the city of Flint and the Flint: MSA began to decline in 1996. According to 
annual estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the Flint MSA., the 
decline in manufacturing was the driving force of unemployment. Employment 
in dais sector consistently fell between 1995 and 2008, from 48,200 jobs to 
9,500/ Over this same period, the share, of manufacturing jobs (of total nonfarm 
employment) dropped from 27% to 9%. This trend is likely due to the region’s 
reliance on the domestic auto industry and the declines in the Big Three’s 
market share that began in the 1980s and led to plant closures in the 1990s and 
early 2000s. According to Genesee County’s audit reports, the county’s largest 
employer in FY.1997 was GM with 40,944 employees. In FY2009, GM still held 
its rank as the county’s largest employer, but with only 3,417 employees in the 
county. 

While the Flint MSA saw a boost in jobs in 2000, the city experienced a long- 
term decline in employment over the period shown, with 39% fewer jobs in 
2014 than existed in 1995. The share of employment in the city compared to the 
MSA as a whole also fell in the same time period; as of 20.1.4, employees in Flint 
represent about 18% of those in the Flint: MSA compared to 26% in 1995. 

The trends in Exhibit li~12 indicate that employment started to recover 
slightly in 20,10. This has been primarily driven by the private sector, namely the 
manufacturing, professional and business services, and trade, transportation 
and utilities sub-sectors. Public sector employment in the region has followed 
national trends as It continues to decline. The overall rise in employment in Flint 
along with the unemployment, income, and poverty trends support the story 
that the city is experiencing signs of economic, recovery.

The industries representing the city’s 10 largest employers have diversified over 
the past decade. Most notable is the increased prevalence of higher education 
and employment services (Exhibit 0-13), During periods of economic decline, 
enrollment: in higher education often increases as individuals seek to expand 
their skill sets or pursue career changes. Demand for job placement services 
also increases. Another trend is the increasing concentration of employees in 
the top 10 employers. The 10 largest employers represented about 65% of the 
total number of employees in 2014 compared to only 59% of the total number 
of employees in 2003. This indicates that the impact of smaller firms in the city 
has diminished over this period. Larger firms tend to have more organizational 
slack, 11 which can act as a buffer during economic downturns. Smaller firms 
that; do not have such slack are likely more vulnerable to poor economic 
environments. Depending on the nature of recovery, employment in small firms 
could diminish even further during future recessions. 

Exhibit ii-14 illustrates the diversification of employment in the city of Flint by 
comparing the share of employees in each industry in 2003 and 2014. The relative 
share of both, automotive employment atid public sector employment dropped 
more significantly than that of healthcare employment.

The city has concentrated efforts to encourage new development. Although most 
new projects include property that is either tax exempt or requires a property 
tax incentive, they have brought employees to the city, which increases the 
nonresident income tax revenue. Recent redevelopment efforts have focused 
on marketing the 452-3 ere vacant “Buick City” property. The Environmental 
Protection Agency has committed up to $7 million for Phase I clean-up of that 
property.™ The total commitment to Buick City is approximately $30 million. 
Funding for the remediation is from the Revitalizing Auto Communities 
Environmental Response (RACER) Trust that wws created through the GM 
bankruptcy. The soil remediation project began in early 2011. According to the 
March 2014 update, corrective measures are being implemented in the Southend 
site. A corrective measures proposal for the Northend cleanup is being reviewed 
and will be presented to the public in summer 20142' 

In November 2013, the American Cast Iron Pipe Company announced plans to 
construct a plant on the Buick City property, creating 50 to 60 manufacturing 
jobs for Flint. The plant opened in December 2014. 

Flint’s air transportation needs are serviced by nearby Bishop International 
Airport, in January 2011, the Bishop Airport Board approved the bid process for 
a $16.8 million expansion. v This project added 47,000 square feet of terminal 
space, four gates and doubled the width of the corridor linking two sections of 
the airport. The expansion was completed in November 2012, adding 350 jobs 
and increasing the number of passengers at Flint’s Bishop International Airport”’ 1 . 
Several highways meet road transportation needs.

Due to its decreasing population, employment, and tax 
revenues, the Flint city government has been under 
considerable fiscal stress in recent years. In the early 2000s, 
an. emergency financial manager (EFM) was appointed for 
the city, and was in place until 2004; however, the city soon 
returned to fiscal insolvency. 

The cycle of returning to a deficit position after an EFM 
appointment ends is not unique to Flint. Drawing on the 
experience of Flint and other cities that have been assigned 
an EFM, state policy makers drafted revisions to PA 72, 
which was replaced by PA 4 in 2011. After a referendum, PA 
4 was repealed in. 2012, then replaced by PA 436 of 2012 s . 

The new law provides greater incentive and mechanisms 
for local governments to address budget challenges before 
an emergency manager (EM) is assigned. PA 436 also 
provides four options to struggling municipalities 9 , offering 
alternatives to the appointment of an EM. Ultimately, 
however, if cities with chronic fiscal stress are. suffering 
from structural challenges beyond their control, improved 
management will only be able to cure a limited number of 
problems. 

If a city is placed in receivership under PA 436 of 2012 
and an EM is appointed by the state, he or she is granted 
broad, powers to address the struggling city’s finances. 

This includes the authority to amend collective bargaining 
agreements, make personnel changes, and review 7 and 
approve the city’s budget. 

Responding to the most recent fiscal crisis, Michigan’s 
Treasury Department conducted, a preliminary review of 
Flint’s financial, situation in August and September 2011. 

™ The review found that general fund expenditures had 
exceeded revenues for the preceding four years. Two years 
after its deficit reduction plan had been submitted to the 
state, the general fund deficit had more than doubled. The 
review also reported that departments within the municipal 
government had been compensating for cash shortages by 
borrowing from other funds. The review 7 team determined 


8 Emergency financial managers were in place, under Act 72; the. term 
“emergency manager” is used in PA 4 and PA 436. There, are somewhat 
different powers under the various acts but otherwise the. concept is the 
same. 

8 These options include entering into a consent, agreement, with the 
state, filing for bankruptcy, agreeing to mediation, or accepting the 
appointment of an EM. 


it was uncertain whether the City of Flint would be able to 
fulfill its short-term financial obligations. 

Due to the City of Flint’s structural deficit, increasing 
legacy costs, and accumulating debt, the review 7 team, 
recommended to the governor that the city be. placed under 
emergency financial, management under Public Act 4. In 
November 2011, the governor of Michigan placed, the City of 
Flint in receivership. 

Michael Brown was appointed as the city’s emergency 
financial manager effective December 1, 2011. In August 
2012, Michael Brown w 7 as replaced by Edward Kurtz as 
emergency manager (who had served as the city’s EM from 
2002 to 2004). Ed Kurtz served as the city’s emergency 
manager until July 2013, at which time Michael Brow r n was 
again appointed by the governor. Michael Brown resigned 
in September 2013; Darnell Earley w 7 as appointed as his 
replacement. In January 2015, it was announced that. Jerry 
Ambrose, w 7 ho had previously served as the. city’s finance 
and administration director, would replace Darnell Earley 
as emergency manager. Jerry Ambrose, served as the city’s 
EM until April. 20.15, when control of the city’s finances 
was returned to the mayor and city council under the 
supervision of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. 

Reforms to Personnel Costs 

Wages and Salaries 

Significant actions w 7 ere taken shortly after Michael Brown’s 
appointment as emergency manager. Almost immediately 
after his appointment, the salaries, benefits, and other 
compensation were eliminated for the city’s mayor and 
nine council, members. The mayor’s salary was later 
restored to 60% of his base salary with full restoration of 
his benefits, and. the salaries of city council members were 
restored to $7,000 per year with no benefits. Additionally, 
council members were required to complete level one of the 
Michigan Municipal League’s core courses for municipal 
government. Several positions were eliminated, which 
included the Office of the Ombudsman, the Civil Service 
Commission, and the respective staff assigned, to these 
offices.

In an effort to reduce the city government’s wage expenses 
by 20%™, significant changes were made to the collective 
bargaining agreements of the City of Flints’s police and fire 
unions. Wages were reduced, across the board, for members 
of all police unions: by 1.5% for sergeants, by 2.5% for 
captains and lieutenants, and by 5% for officers). Salaries 
and wages of members of the firefighters’ union were also 
reduced 10 . 

Substantial changes were also made to the city government 
contracts with the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) locals 1600 and 
1799, the unions representing the majority of general city 
government employees. Wages for Local 1600 members 
were reduced by 2.5%, and several changes to overtime, 
holiday, and leave pay were made for both unions. 

With the. exception of emergency overtime, the EM required 
that all employee overtime be approved in. advance. 
Executive orders were also issued to put limitations on 
departments’ spending authority, with EM approval 
required, for purchases over $10,000. Stringent budgetary 
guidelines were put. on all departments, emphasizing that 
budgetary authority is not a mandate to spend and that 
actions to keep expenses low should be taken whenever 
possible. 

Pensions 

Changes were made to police and. fire unions’ pension 
eligibility. Employees’ annual pension, contributions were 
increased to 9,5% of all earnings for those in the fire and 
police unions. For members of the unions hired prior to the 
introduction of the new pension guidelines, the portion 
of pensions earned up to the 20th year of service are 
calculated according to the expired bargaining agreement. 
However, the multiplier was reduced to 2.25 and capped at 
240 hours of leave time included as part of the. final average 
compensation (FAC) for all service time earned after the 
effective dates of the new collective bargaining agreements. 

Similar adjustments w T ere made to the pension benefits 
for locals 1600 and 1799. The defined benefit multiplier 
was reduced to 1.5% prospectively, and the employee 
contribution rate was increased from 8% to 12% for Local 
1600 and to 9.5% for Local 1799. Hybrid retirement plans 
(with both defined contribution and defined benefit 
components) were established for new hires and former 
defined, benefit plan participants. Employees’ contributions 
to the defined contribution components are matched by the 
City of Flint; employer contributions to the defined benefit 
component were capped at 10%. 


® From $63,080.16 to $50,791.52 for CAD supervisors, from. $60,515.52 
to $56,998.24 for quartermaster, and from $33,467.20 to $27,270.88 for 
comm, specialist trainees 


To save administration-related costs, pensions for all unions 
with collective bargaining agreements with the City of Flint 
were transferred from the Flint Employees’ Retirement 
System (FER.S) to the Michigan Municipal Employees 
Retirement System (MERS).“ This move was approved by 
all but the police officers’ union; section 19(k) of PA 4 was 
invoked to approve the transfer of Flint police officers’ 
pensions. 

Other Post-Employment Benefits 

Changes were made to the healthcare benefits received 
by retirees of the police and fire, unions. Cuts included 
discontinuing healthcare, for a former employees’ spouse if 
he or she is eligible to receive paid health coverage through 
an employer or former employer. The City or Flint reduced 
the number of plans offered to employees hired after July 
.1, 2012, offering a high deductible plan in conjunction, with 
a health savings account. Through executive orders, the 
EM reserved the right of the city to change or discontinue 
the health insurance programs in response to the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPA.CA.) as amended. 

The City of Flint scaled back its contribution requirements 
for an active employee’s health coverage, requiring 
employees to pay any premium contributions that exceed 
the amount contributed by the employer through pension 
deductions. 

Retirees and their spouses aged 65 and over who are 
covered by Medicare supplemental plan at. the employer’s 
expense are. subject to contribution limits of the Publicly- 
Funded Health Insurance Contribution. Act. (PA .152 of 2012) 
if and. only if the retiree enrolls in and pays for Medicare 
Supplemental Part R. Changes made to the healthcare 
coverage of retired members of the local 1600 and 1799 
unions were similar to those of the other major unions 
representing City of Flint employees. 

Changes were made to the retiree health benefits offered 
to personnel hired after the effective dates of the new 
agreements. Instead of employer -paid retiree healthcare 
coverage, members of the police officers’ and firefighters’ 
unions, as well as locals 1.600 and 1799 hired after April 20.1.2 
were, eligible for Retiree Medical Savings Accounts (RMS As) 
to which the City of Flint and employees contribute 
through payroll deductions. 

Under the executive orders, the City of Flint committed 
to contribute $1,500 annually to the RMSAs, with 
employees contributing $600 per year. Employees will, be 
100% vested at all times on their own contributions and 
investment earnings, while employer contributions and 
investment earnings will be 100% vested after five years of 
completed service. The same changes were made to retiree 
health benefits of newly hired nonunion city government 


employees. Contributions to a new employee’s RMSA 
continue until the employee is no longer employed by the 
City of Flint (including retirement) or when the employee 
becomes eligible for Medicare. These benefits were not 
made available to nonunion retirees or spouses who are 
eligible for health coverage through another employer or 
former employer. 

Other Reforms 

In addition to actions taken to reduce the City of Flint’s 
financial obligations in relation to staff, other measures 
were taken to address the growing deficit. User fees were 
implemented for waste collection and a special assessment 
was levied, to provide funds for the. operation of street 
lighting (to eliminate $2.85 million in costs to the city 
government’s general fund x ). Both fees were added to 


homeowners’ property tax bills. Water and sewer rates 
were increased by 25% to adequately cover the. costs of 
operating both systems. 

The City of Flint’s Fiscal. Year 2013 budget, passed by an 
executive order on April 24, 2012, was the first balanced 
budget it had passed in seven years. A. total, of 155 positions 
(16% of the workforce) were eliminated.” 

Property taxes were increased in order to support: police 
and fire budgets. This increase was achieved by a vote of 
the. city’s residents, who approved a 6 mill property tax 
increase on. November 6, 2012. xii This tax. increase allowed 
the city government to maintain staffing levels in the police 
and fire departments that, had, up until that point, been 
supported through a federal grant. 



IV. City Finances 

Repeated periods of governmental fund deficits can be used to identify cities 
with chronic fiscal stress. If a city is consistently unable to sustain a positive 
fund balance, it is likely facing structural budgetary constraints. The City of 
Flint’s fund balance/accumulated deficit history highlights its recurring deficits 
(Exhibit i¥-1). Temporary solutions provided some periods of short-term relief 
in 2005 to 2007 due to the measures taken by an emergency financial manager 
under Public Act 72 of 1990. The governor appointed the EFM in May 2002, who 
remained in place until 2004. The progress made during the EFM’s tenure was 
undone three years later due to subsequent labor settlements, costly litigation, 
and declining revenues. The City of Flint closed FY2G08 with a deficit in the 
General Fund of $6.8 million. Since 2010, the Flint city government has been able 
to build up the fund balances in its other governmental funds, but has mixed 
performance in controlling the deficit in its General Fund, which is the main, 
fund for general operating expenses. 

'WW’S B'feS’R 9W8B 8 sxvsS Bwh 

As of June 30, 2014, the City of Flint’s General Fund ended the year with an 
accumulated deficit of $8.9 million. This is the seventh consecutive year that the 
fund balance has been in a deficit position, but significantly reduced from the 
$19.1 million deficit in FY2012. FY2014 is also the third year since FY2006 that the 
city operated, with a surplus in its General Fund; the only other year in which the 
General Fund ended with a surplus is FY2011 (Exhibit 8Y~2).

Revenues and Expenditures

Annual Financial Reports 





Revenues 

As of 2014, the four primary sources of revenue, and their proportionate share 
of the General Fund, are property tax (10%), income tax (24%), state shared 
revenue (32%), and charges for services (18%). Exhibit i¥-3 shows the changes 
in the share of General Fund revenues over time. Typically, the property tax 
is the primary source of revenue for local governments. However, the City of 
Flint's reliance on the property tax has severely diminished over the last several 
years, which is a testament to the impact of falling property values in the city. 
Conversely, the share of revenues from charges for services has seen an overall 
growth. In. FY2010, the share or revenues from charges for services actually 
exceeded that: from property taxes. Both the share of revenues of income taxes 
and of state shared revenue have also declined, but to a lesser extent. The 
spike in the share of “Other” revenue funds in FY2011 was due to an $8 million 
debt issuance in the form, of 25-year fiscal stabilization bonds from the Local 
Government Loan Program through the Michigan Department of Treasury. This 
was less than, half of the $20 million in bonds that the City of Flint had initially- 
requested in order maintain operations when it had anticipated, that it would 
run. out of cash by March 1, 20,1.1. 


Property Tax 

Property tax in Michigan is assessed on both real and personal property, though 
municipalities are limited in levying property taxes in. a number of ways. First, 
the Home Rule City Act of 1909 limits cities in Michigan to levying property 
taxes of no more than. 20 mills for direct municipal services.™ Next, the Headlee 
Amendment, ratified in. 1978, limits the authorized millage rate when property 
values rise at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. xiv Increases in property values 
due to improvements or new construction are not subject to this limit. Finally, 
in 1994, Michigan voters approved Proposal A, which limited annual increases to 
the taxable value to 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, until there is 
a transfer of ownership.”

Compared to the 10 most populated local units in Genesee County, which 
represent 72% of the population, the city of Flint levies the highest homestead 
tax rate (Exhibit !¥~4). This may cause the city to be less competitive in 
attracting residents, which hinders its ability to increase its tax base. High 
tax rates also create incentives for residents to relocate to the suburban areas, 
which may be one factor that contributes to the population decentralization 
trends shown in Exhibit II~2. For example, a homeowner in the city of Flint 
will pay, on average, 37.7% more in property taxes than residents of the nine 
other largest communities that own properties with the same taxable value. 

This is a substantial increase compared, to the same analysis that was performed, 
in the 2011 case study; in FY20I1, a homeowner in Flint would pay on average 
28.2% more than a homeowner in the other nine communities with, a property 
that had the same taxable value. If a residential property has a taxable value of 
$75,000, the homeowner in Flint will pay $4,413. A homeowner in the next: most- 
populated community. Grand Blanc Charter Township, will pay $3,119.

Although the nonhomestead property tax rate had been fairly stable from 2000 
to 2010, a more noticeable increase has occurred over the last few years (Exhibit 
i V-S). In 2013, the direct city millage increased from 16.1 to 19.1 mills with the 
addition of the 6 mill public safety millage and an elimination of a 3 mill waste 
collection millage. 

As discussed in section II, property values in Flint have dramatically declined 
over the past four years. Exhibit SY-S shows a corresponding reduction in 
property tax revenues; receipts from property taxes in FY2014 were less than half 
those in FY2006, and less than 40% of their peak in FY2008. The deterioration 
of the property tax as a stable revenue source is especially clear given that less 
than 10% of General Fund revenues are dependent on property taxes in FY2014 
compared to more than 18% five years prior.

Of the 10 largest cities in Michigan, three are authorized to levy an income tax, 
including Flint. The Income tax rate is 1% for city residents and 0.5% for non- 
residents. Income tax receipts steadily declined from FY2006 to FY20.10 (Exhibit 
1 V~7). Since FY2010, this revenue stream has stabilized and seen some slight 
growth, though it fell again in FY2014. 


State shared revenue is generated from, a statewide sales tax. Revenue sharing to 
local governments consists of both constitutional and statutory payments. The 
constitutional portion is distributed on a population basis. The statutory portion 
of revenue sharing is defined by a formula based on a combination of population, 
taxable value per capita, and millage yield (a ratio of the taxable value per mill 
levied). Starting in FY2012, the statutory revenue sharing was replaced with 
the Economic Vitality Incentive Program (EVIP). M The EV1P allocates funding 
to cities, villages, and townships based on their ability to satisfy certain 
criteria, but relies on the old statutory program to determine participation and 
individual payment amounts. Exhibit IV-8 shows the breakdown between the

FY1998. While constitutional payments have been fairly constant, there has been 
a substantial decline in statutory/EVIP payments. 

Exhibit SV-9 displays the change in state shared revenue over time as reported 
in the city’s financial audit reports. 

Charges for Services 

While all other revenue sources have been declining since FY2006, income from 
user fees and charges for services have actually increased on a nominal basis over 
the same period (Exhibit IV-10). Though it has fluctuated in recent years, the 
percentage of revenues and transfers from, charges for services is still relatively 
high compared to FY2G06. This is indicative of cities undergoing fiscal stress 
since they seek to replace the typical tax and intergovernmental sources with 
other revenue streams.

> Law office 

> Human resources 

> City administrator 

Expenditures on general government have followed an overall decline since 
FY2008 (Exhibit IY-13). The exception in FY2011 was due to a settlement 
payment related to a lawsuit against the city regarding the sale of the Genesee 
Towers building. 

Revenues and expenditure trends for other governmental funds are shown in

The City of Flint’s two proprietary funds include water supply and sewer 
disposal operations. Prior to FY2G12, Hurley Medical Center and the Golf 
Division were considered business-type activities as part of the city government 
under proprietary funds. However, starting in FY2012, the city began presenting 
Hurley as a separate component: unit in the audit report, and in March 2012, the 
city entered into agreements with Flint City Golf, LLC, and the Mott Park Public 
Golf Course Association to operate the city’s golf courses. 

Historically, the City of Flint purchased Lake Huron water from, the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). Per a resolution that authorized the 
sale of Drinking Water Revolving Fund bonds, the city government sets its w'ater 
rates to cover expenses of the administration and operation, of the water system. 
These expenses include the rates charged by the DWSD, which had increased 
on average by 10% per year. The rates must be sufficient to pay an amount equal 
to 125% of principal and interest on bonds and any other obligations. In January 
2011, the city increased water and sewer rates by 2.5% and 22% respectively. 
Another increase of 35% on both water and sewer rates followed in September 
2011. it! order to meet these revenue requirements. 

In April 2013, the. city ended its contract with DWSD, and opted instead to 
contract with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to build a pipeline from. 
Lake Huron to Genesee County. Effective October 1, 2013, the City of Flint 
entered into a contract to purchase water from the KWA., with the pipeline 
expected to be completed, in July 2016. The city officially switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, to be used until the agreement with the 
KWA came into effect. However, the city and its residents have experienced 
several issues with water quality since then. xviii . Flint was awarded $2 million 
from the state through Michigan’s Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program to improve its water infrastructure and quality™.

Expenditures and transfers out 



In general, the revenues and transfers Into the water supply fund have exceeded 
expenditures and transfers out (Exhibit 8V-15), 

In contrast, the sewer disposal, fund had seen major deficits annually up 
until FY2013 (Exhibit IV-16). One major contributor to the operating losses 
associated with this fund is internal borrowing by other funds. This will, be 
discussed in more detail, in section V.

The City of Flint allocates the internal service funds for data processing, fringe 
benefits, central maintenance garage, and self-insurance. Internal service funds 
should be self-sustaining through charges for services to other departments and 
funds. However, this is not always the case, as shown by the positive figures for 
“Transfers In” in Exhibit IY-17. The Central Maintenance Garage Fund received 
incoming transfers for six consecutive years. On average, these transfers amount 
to about 28% of operating costs annually. There was an exception in FY2013, in 
which the Central Maintenance Garage Fund issued an outgoing transfer to the 
Garbage Collection Fund in order to transfer proceeds related to the sale of city 
garbage trucks.

Debt 


The City of Flint’s bond rating has not been updated since the 2011 case study 
was written. The last bond rating was performed by Moody’s Investor Service in 
February 2006. At that time, the City of Flint was assigned a rating of Bal with a 
stable outlook. 

According to the city’s financial audit reports, the City Charter limits net debt 
to 7% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the city. Exhibit 
V-1 discloses breakdown of the city’s net debt limit since 2004. While the 
absolute amount of the city’s debt has been fairly stable over time, the decline 
in property values in the city has closed the legal debt margin considerably 
(Exhibit V~1). As a result, the net debt as a percentage of the debt: limit has 
jumped from about 4.3% in FY2007 to 16.6% in FY20I3. 

Many cities with chronic fiscal stress have a significantly large debt burden, 
which has not necessarily been the case for the City of Flint. The 2011 case study 
noted that this issue of fiscal distress was mainly due to the lack of capacity to 
issue debt or manage a long-term capital improvement program. In FY20U, the 
City made its final payment on an. $8 million financial recovery bond issued in 
2004 when it was operating under the authority of a state-appointed EFM. As 
noted earlier, the current level of fiscal stress has caused the City of Flint to 
seek $20 million fiscal stabilization bonds, of which it received $8 million. These 
funds are intended to address the chronic cash shortage and unfunded prior 
operating expenditures. Recurring cash shortages and the need to finance prior 
years’ operations are often considered additional red flags indicating chronic 
fiscal stress. 

Another symptom of chronic fiscal stress is an increased reliance on internal 
borrowing, another trend that has continued since the 2011 case study. When 
the City of Flint has difficulty obtaining external financing at a reasonable rate, 
cash from, internal funds becomes a default source of borrowing. Exhibit V-2 
summarizes interfund borrowing activity since FY2006. The nature of this type, 
of activity? is generally related to operating transactions among funds. The City 
of Flint has used this to address cash shortages at the close of the fiscal year. 

The “Due to/from Other Funds” section, is related to short-term loans, while the

“Advances to/from Other Funds” is related to long-term loans. A concern, arises 
when these balances are significant in dollar amounts and present for more than 
one year. The City of Flint’s General Fund has relied on short-term interfund 
resources for seven out of the last nine fiscal years and long-term interfund 
resources since FY2GI2. As shown in Exhibit ¥-2, the primary lending fund for 
these transfers has been the Sewer Disposal Division Fund, which contributes to 
the fund’s long-term structural deficit, as reported in Exhibit i¥~1 B on page 26. 
The short-term balance of approximately $13.2 million at June 30, 2013, equates 
to almost 25% of General Fund revenues for FY2014. 

Tn July 2012, the Flint City Council President, along with three other residents, 
filed a lawsuit against: the city, claiming that the water and sewer rate increases 
in 20.1.1 violated city ordinances.** The claim was that because water and sewer 
funds have been transferred to the General Fund, additional funds raised had 
not been allocated toward their intended purposes. A Genesee County Circuit 
Court j udge dismissed the case in June 2013, claiming that: the rate increases 
were in compliance with. Public Act 4, which granted legal power to emergency 
managers to make rate, increases to reflect true operating costs. 

As noted in the 2011 case study, advances among funds are often formalized in 
a written note with, specific payment terms including an interest rate. The City 
of Flint has used advances to fund capital equipment purchases in its internal 
services funds. Such reliance on interfund borrowings may restrict the lending 
fund’s financial flexibility and use of resources for the designated purpose. 
Recent advances from the Sewer Disposal Division Fund to the General Fund 
represent return on equity.

VI. Personnel Costs 


Exhibit VI-1 Flint Full-Time 
Equivalent Employees 

Data source: City of Flint Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report 


Annual 



The City of Flint’s payroll has declined by almost 1,000 full-time equivalent 
employees, about 63%, since 2001 due to attrition and downsizing (Exhibit 
VI-1). This breaks down to a 59% reduction in public safety employees and a 
65% reduction in other city employees. The majority of this reduction has taken 
place since 2008. 


The City of Flint has a defined benefit pension plan with a benefit: that ranges 
from 1.7% to 2.6% of the participant’s Final Average Compensation (FAC) based 
on the last three years of credited service, multiplied by the years of credit 
service based on the date of hire. Employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 
years of credited service (eight: years for appointed officials) or those members 
with 25 years of credited service (23 years for police and fire employees), 
regardless of their age, are entitled to a retirement benefit. Certain police 
members can voluntarily retire at age 50 with 25 years of service. Benefits fully 
vest on reaching 10 years of service with the benefit: payable at age 55. The plan 
requires employee contributions ranging from 0% to 9%. 

Beginning in October 2012, the City of Flint closed out its single-employer plan 
and transferred approximately $270 million of assets to the Michigan Municipal 
Employees’ Retirement System, an. agent multi-employer plan that covers 
substantially all employees of city government:. The City of Flint’s unfunded 
pension liability is $241 million, as of its most recent actuarial valuation. 


Defined benefit plan pension benefits are determined by following a three-part:

Years of Service - Years of service is based on actual employee service, 
although sometimes the employee or employer may “buy” years of service at an 
actuarially determined cost. Unless this is fully funded in advance, it increases 
the long-term liability. 

Final Average Compensation (FAC) - The final average compensation is 
the average of wages or salary paid to the employee based, on a predetermined 
number of years. Identifying what type of compensation is included in the FAC 
is important. If it includes overtime, vacation leave payout, longevity, and other 
pay items, the cost to the employer increases. When the FAC is determined 
using fewer years, typically the benefit is higher since it is based, on highest 
years. When the FAC period is very short, even small increases in overtime, 
compensatory time payout, or accrued leave time payout will increase the 
pension. This is the reason some retirees’ actual pension benefits are higher than 
their regular full-time pay as active employees. 

Pension Multiplier ~ The pension multiplier represents a percent of pay for 
each year or service. 

A cost of living adjustment (COLA) provides an annual increase in benefit 
retirement. A COLA benefit of E2 provides a 2% annual increase in pension 
for retirees. Granting automatic pension increases can further constrain future 
administrations. Employers typically have a pension plan design where they may 
instead grant a one-time COLA adjustment to retirees. 

The proportion of the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) that the city 
government has contributed to cover pension expenses has improved over the 
past several years (Exhibit VI -2), For every year since. FY2009, the City of Flint 
has contributed at least the ARC amount. 

Flint’s pension Unfunded Accrued Actuarial Liability (UAAL) has increased 
from $194 million in 2006 to $323 million in 2011, which was the time of the last 
actuarial valuation (Exhibit Vi-3). The funded ratio fell during this time from 
81% to 61%.

The City of Flint contributes to other post-employment benefits (OPFB) for 
public safety and genera] employees under collective bargaining agreements of 
Local 1799, Local 1600, and Fire Local 352. The proportion of the ARC that the 
city has paid to cover OPEB expenses has improved over the past couple years, 
from 31% in FY2011 to only 114% in FY2014 (Exhibit VS»4). 

Since its actuarial valuation in 2006, the City of Flint’s unfunded OPEB liability 
has been cut by $468 million. The city government began advance funding its 
OPEB plan in FY2012, which has been reflected in its 2012 actuarial valuation. As 
of this valuation, the plan is 0.1% funded, though that dropped to 0% in the 2013 
valuation {Exhibit YI-5).

VII. Conclusion 


On April 30, 2015, Gov. Rick Snyder rescinded the financial 
emergency in Flint and restored home rule and the power 
of the city’s elected officials. It had been more than 10 years 
since the last: time such an event occurred in Flint in the 
summer of 2004. Many questions still continue to swirl 
around the city’s fiscal and economic future. A review of the 
reforms and changes that occurred since the appointment of 
an emergency manager in. 2011 is a useful starting point for 
the city to understand the future fiscal trajectory it faces. 
This review will allow local and state officials to assess the 
reforms and changes in place and shape the future fiscal 
policy of the city of Flint, Michigan. 

Changes implemented by the four emergency managers 
appointed to oversee Flint’s finances were aimed at 
reducing the. city’s considerable budgetary deficit through 
reducing its financial obligations, especially pensions 
and other retiree benefits, while increasing city revenue. 
Some of the most significant changes have impacted the 
employees and retirees of the City of Flint. These two 
groups were the most important creditors of the city 
government. They remain so. Like, many city governments 
in Michigan, Flint, does not. carry a large debt burden 
outside of water and sewer borrowing. This means that city 
retirees and employees are the groups owed the most, by 
the city government and therefore, will be the most: directly 
impacted during a financial reorganization following a fiscal 
crisis. 

The structure of the city government was changed, with 
staffing reduced by 20%. A city administrator, who will 
serve as the city’s chief administrative officer, was hired 
on a five-year contract. Among other responsibilities, the 
city administrator has the authority to negotiate collective 
bargaining agreements with the city’s employee unions. 

Reforms were also made to the way the city’s budgeting 
practices, requiring two-year budgeting and three-year 
financial forecasts to be performed annually. This will allow 
city officials to identify and potentially deal with budgetary 
issues before they occur. The city government also adopted 
a master plan for the first time since the 1960s. The master 
plan identifies a vision for the city. It was developed with 
considerable input from the residents of Flint. 

The electorate of Flint passed a referendum, to have a 
Charter Review Commission put in place in the summer of 
2015. The nine-member commission was elected in May of 
2015. It: will review the entire charter and assess options for 
reform. This is an excellent opportunity for the commission 
and the citizens of Flint to evaluate the current charter 
and determine a path forward for the city government that 
includes short-and long-term solvency. 


The emergency manager signed a number of final orders 
before leaving office in April 2015. These orders involved, 
the city council including agenda and meeting dates. They 
also included setting the special assessment for street 
lighting, restoring mayor and city council compensation, 
and. adopting a set budget for FY 2016 and 2017. In addition, 
they included an order ensuring compliance with the so- 
called hard cap section of PA 152 of 2011 stating that the city 
shall not pay more than 80% of employee healthcare plans. 

The final and perhaps most important order of the Flint 
emergency manager was issued on April 30, 2015. The 
overall purpose of the order is to ensure that the mayor 
and city council shall implement reforms and changes to 
maintain the fiscal stability of the city government. These 
provisions included following the recommendations of 
the Receivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) and 
city administrator. Specific, other actions include 1) fully 
funding the annual pension requirement, 2) not interfering 
with city employees, 3) observing the. budget ordinance, 4) 
ensuring all local laws are consistent with state laws, 5) not 
issuing debt without approval of the RTAB, 6) documenting 
all city liabilities, 7) verifying the appropriate eligibility 
requirements of all official city positions, 8) acting 
expeditiously on all economic development projects, and 9) 
reviewing and acting expeditiously on all intergovernmental 
cooperation initiatives by the city administrator. All of 
these provisions are intended to ensure that the. city 
government, as dictated by the mayor and city council, 
follow certain practices and recommendations that are. 
intended to maintain fiscal stability and solvency. These 
types of provisions were not in place after the 2002-04 
crisis. 

The city administrator is also subject to a number of 
provisions in the final EM order. These provisions include 
1) overseeing day-to-day operation of city government, 2) 
negotiating and recommending changes to bargaining unit 
contracts to the RTAB, 3) submitting regular reports on 
city progress, 4) ensuring full compliance with PA 436 of 
2012, 5) not removing city administrator without approval 
of RTAB, 6) observing all purchasing order ordinances, and. 
7) serving as primary interface between city council and 
city employees. Again, all of these provisions are meant: to 
ensure the fiscal, stability or the city government. 

The changes made by the emergency managers have 
improved Flint’s financial position. The general fund deficit 
was reduced from its peak of over $.19 million in FY2012 
to just over $8 million in the most recent fiscal year. The 
city has applied for a $7 million loan from Michigan’s 
Emergency Loan Board, which would effectively eliminate 


33 




this deficit. Pension and OPEB liabilities have been 
significantly reduced, and reforms to employee collective 
bargaining agreements have reduced future legacy costs. 
Other cost-saving measures include transferring emergency 
dispatch to Genesee County and contracting out waste 
collection. 

Despite the progress made since a fiscal emergency was 
declared, in 20.1.1, the City of Flint still faces considerable 
challenges to its fiscal solvency. Outgoing emergency 
manager jerry Ambrose mentioned some of these in his 
final letter, including the lawsuit filed on behalf of Flint’s 
retirees over changes made to their healthcare benefits, 
the structural deficit that still exists in the city’s financial 
projections, challenges to fund the city’s public safety 
needs, and the city’s ageing infrastructure. 

The overall Flint fiscal playbook that has been enacted by 
the state government and. its emergency managers serves 
as an important: template for these types of interventions.^ 


11 This statement is not meant as recommendation or approval for the 
state emergency manager law. There are many dimensions upon which 
the state emergency manager should be assessed. This statement is 
simply meant to reflect that, in following this path, the Flint experience, 
with one of the state’s largest cities, may be an important reference 
point. 


The first part of the playbook is that any reforms or 
changes must be in reference to the largest component of 
the fiscal problem, which in this case related to liabilities 
owed to employees and retirees. Many important changes 
were made to wages and compensation, pension system 
benefits, medical benefits and other such liabilities. Of 
equal or perhaps greater importance, there are a number 
of safeguards now in place to ensure that these changes 
remain in place for a long period. Any adjustments to these 
reforms must go through the city administrator and the 
RTAB. These safeguards are obviously meant to prevent 
any backsliding to previous wage or benefit: levels, it is this 
type of activity that led to the most recent crisis, as changes 
made by the emergency financial manager in 2004 were not 
kept in. place and most of those changes were rescinded 
by the elected officials between 2004 and. 2011. Those 
changes, combined with the worst recession since the Great 
Depression, meant that the city faced, short- and long-term 
fiscal insolvency in 2011.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

• DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 
representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHFIS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 1 6, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 


• Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCFID) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCFID is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 

• DHFIS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

EPA Establishes Safe Drinking Water Task Force to Provide Technical Expertise to MDEQ and City of Flint 

Task Force providing technical assistance on reconnecting the Flint drinking water system to a new source 

CHICAGO (October 16, 2015) - Today U S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman 
established the Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through regular 
conversations with designated officials from Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the City of Flint. 
The Task Force will be led by the Region 5 Deputy Regional Administrator and will assist with developing and 
implementing a plan to secure water quality, including measures to optimize corrosion control. Task Force members will 
be available to consult with MDEQ and the City of Flint on site in Flint. The Task Force will also coordinate as necessary 
with federal, state and local public health agencies to assist with protection of public health. 

Specifically, the Task Force will provide technical assistance to the MDEQ and the City of Flint to reconnect the Flint 
system to a new source of drinking water (to be supplied by the Great Lakes Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion 
control for the Flint system, starting in October 2015. The Task Force will also provide technical assistance to the MDEQ 
and the City of Flint, as needed, in advance of and following connection of the Flint water system to a new source of 
drinking water (to be supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion control for the Flint system, 
starting in 201 6. 

“EPA is committed to working with our state and local partners to ensure a safe and reliable drinking water supply for the 
residents of Flint, Michigan,” Hedman said. “The formation of this task force continues our commitment to providing 
technical assistance to the City of Flint and the State of Michigan.” 

The Task Force will be comprised of scientists and technical experts from the EPA Region 5 office in Chicago, 
the National Risk Management Research Lab in Cincinnati and the EPA drinking water program. In addition, EPA will ask 
the Governor to designate a MDEQ official and the Mayor of Flint to designate a city official, to serve as points of contact 
for the Task Force.

Looks fine to me, but given the subject matter I think you probably want to get a sign off from someone who has been 
plugged into this issue (Beth or Jarrod, I guess.)

Subject: Governor's Flint Water Advisory Task Force - Logistics Update 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 

This is to provide a brief update on some of the arrangements that we are making to conduct the work of the Governor's Flint 

Water Advisory Task Force (FWATF): 

• To simplify communications among task force members, the Task Force has decided to close the Basecamp project 
that was initially set up for the entirety of the roster provided earlier. The Basecamp project for the FWATF will be 
maintained for task force members. Accordingly, to archive documents for the FWATF's review and consideration, 
please e-mail to me ( erotbste@grE-ltd.com ) or any one of the FWATF members and we will arrange for posting to 
Basecamp. If you have large documents or a large number of documents, please contact me and we can arrange for 
posting to Dropbox. 

o (This is why the project has not been accessible in the event that you have tried to load documents) 

• I thought it might be helpful for the FWATF to develop a brief status report on our activities — interviews and 
meetings conducted and scheduled, documents collected, etc. - perhaps on a bi-weekly or even weekly basis. So, 
unless there is objection or concerns, I will try to craft a reporting template for discussion by the FWATF at our next 
regularly scheduled meeting. If you have suggestions for this reporting, please send along. 

• We have put on our respective calendars a weekly meeting, generously hosted at PSC offices, on Wednesday 
mornings. We are also attempting to schedule a "listening session" in Flint in the next few weeks as well as briefing 
sessions with MDEQ and MHHS. 


My apologies for any confusion regarding the Basecamp set-up. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Please see below and attached release per brief convo at senior staff. Sill no exact word on timing of blood lead level

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 


i 



For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
conducted, visit www.michigan.gov/fiintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at knsztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, or by emailing

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 
assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 
provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 

As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water 
testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling 
results from Freeman Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even 
individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools 
and other buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. 
“Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing 
fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the 
state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty- 
two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high 
results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or 
plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for 
several minutes, lead levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, 
systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and 
fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized 
flushing regimen. The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing 
period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, 
so we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related 




components where high lead levels were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. 
“Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the 
water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our 
students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have 
access to safe, clean drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling 
was conducted, visit www.michiqan.gov/flintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will 
soon be available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the 
Flint Community Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools 
and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michiqan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took 
advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 
percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and 
more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less.

New release on blood lead level testing in Flint. 


Good afternoon Governor and team, 

Just wanted to give you a heads up about a release DHHS is issuing today with updated 
blood lead level testing. About 500 more people have been tested since the last release, 
and eight more people had elevated levels. 

The format and information is similar to the previous release. DHHS plans to issue such 
updates every three weeks for the time being to show transparency, remind people that 
testing is available if they are concerned, and that free filters and replacement cartridges 
are available. 

I've pasted the release below. 

Have a nice weekend,

MDHHS releases latest round of Flint blood lead level data 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued 
its newest summary report on lead testing in Flint. According to preliminary data, 39 of 
1,836 adults and children tested had elevated blood lead levels since Oct. 1. 

“As testing continues, our focus remains on helping families reduce all potential exposures 
to lead,” said Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive. “We are working closely 
with the Genesee County Health Department to provide information and offer tools in the 
community, and encourage families to explore the resources that are available to them.” 

Both capillary and venous blood tests are included in the report, and people who have had 
multiple tests are counted only once. Tests and their results cover the time since the state 
action plan was put in place on Oct. 2, and capture the number of elevated blood lead 
levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter. 


l 



MDHHS is working closely with local partners to offer resources and distribute important 
lead testing and prevention information. Additional state funding has allowed for Genesee 
County Health Department (GCHD) nurses to work with families when an elevated blood 
lead level is detected. These families can also choose to have the nurse coordinate an 
environmental health investigation in their home to identify lead exposures, which could 
be lead from paint, soil, plumbing, and other sources. 

To support these efforts, the state is coordinating with its Medicaid health plans and 
provider communities on enhanced screening and testing. In addition to mandated testing 
at ages one and two for the Medicaid population, MDHHS has recommended blood lead 
testing for any child younger than six years of age in Flint who has not previously been 
tested. The state, in coordination with GCHD, developed and issued a Health Alert 
Network (HAN) notification for local providers to help ensure consistent messaging and 
protocols among primary care providers. 

Free water filters and replacement cartridges are still available to Flint residents. For a full 
list of locations and hours of distribution, or to view the full blood lead level report, visit 
www. mic hi g a it . go v/fli ntwater . The summary will be updated as more data becomes 
available. 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the 
original when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional video on its YouTube 
channel. For this and other updates, visit www.michigan.gov/fllntwater.

Team, 

As you are aware, we have been working closely with the independent task force that has been 
reviewing state, local and federal actions regarding the serious health issues related to water in Flint. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet complete, members have made the Governor aware of 
some interim findings, and there are interim steps the Governor has decided to take immediately in 
order to restore trust in how we in state government keep residents safe and informed. 

As part of this process, Dan Wyant, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, has offered his 
resignation, and Governor has reluctantly decided to accept it. There are likely to be other personnel 
changes in MDEQas well. 

I want to thank Dan for his service. He has been the DEQ director since the start of the administration, 
and previously headed the Agriculture Department under both Gov. Engler and Gov. Granholm. He is 
passionate about public service and protecting our state's environment. 

The situation in Flint is serious and challenging. We will continue work closely with the task force and 
city leaders as we move forward, committed to protecting the health of people living in Flint and around 
our state. 

Sincerely,

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 


GOVERNOR’S OFFICE BRIEFING PAPER 
CITY OF FLINT DRINKING WATER 


What contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the city of Flint? 

A number of factors, not one specific cause, likely contributed to the Boil Water 
Advisories (BWAs) in the city of Flint during August and September 2014. While use of 
the Flint River has increased the amount of natural organic matter in the city’s water, the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has performed well above treatment requirements 
for organic carbon removal. In addition, less than 20 percent of the water system was 
included in the advisory area. If treatment had been compromised, detections would 
have been widespread throughout the city, rather than in such a localized area. 

The city’s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment 
and asset management. Most of the city’s over 550 miles of water mains are now over 
75 years old and constructed of cast iron piping. Cast iron pipe is subject to internal 
corrosion, called tuberculation, which causes buildup on the pipe interior, leading to 
water quality issues, reduced flow and pressures, and leakage. Tuberculation also 
encourages the development of biofilms, layers of bacteria that attach to the interior 
pipe wall. Biofilm growth is common in areas of piping with little or no disinfectant 
residual, and together with tuberculation can clog water lines to the point of insufficient 
water pressure. 

The city has also experienced decades of a declining user base and water use 
associated with vacant homes, commercial businesses, and industrial property. 

Declining water use leads to excess residence time within the city’s distribution pipes 
and water storage facilities, accelerating tuberculation, biofilm growth, and disinfectant 
residual degradation. While the city has recently seen an infusion of funding for blight 
removal, contractors completing this work have been improperly using fire hydrants, 
causing hydraulic disturbances that dislodged and suspended settled debris, which may 
have contributed to the bacterial contamination. 

The winter of 2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water system. The 
city, which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 30 percent, has seen even 
greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold weather-related water 
main breaks and leaks. The city lacks a formal maintenance program for its over 7,250 
valves, which would normally be used to limit impacts during break repairs. Two valves 
on the transmission line used to supply the area of the BWAs were found to be closed 
during the city’s investigation, causing longer residence time, reduced disinfectant 
residual, reduced flow, and reduced pressure. One of these valves has remained 
broken. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 2 


The BWAs also occurred during the warmest and, for 2014, relatively wet periods of 
August and September. Warm weather conditions are not only more conducive to 
bacterial growth but also degrade the water’s disinfectant residual carried out from the 
WTP more quickly. Longer residence times, biofilms, and tuberculation also contribute 
to disinfectant residual degradation. Warm wet weather conditions also allow water 
contaminated with bacteria to pool around piping with leaks and breaks. 

Process for Issuance and Cancelation of a Boil Water Advisory 

There are a number of conditions that can trigger BWAs. This includes the following: 

- Bacteria Monitoring Detections - Loss of System Pressure 

- Bacteria Standards Violations - Water Main Breaks 

- Treatment System Failures - Other Interruptions in Service 

- Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has developed a policy and procedure 
regarding BWAs to help guide staff, provide consistency, and maintain public health. A 
PDF of Policy and Procedure No. ODWMA-399-022 is being forwarded with this briefing 
paper. 

BWAs may be self-initiated by the water system, issued collaboratively in consultation 
with the DEQ, or when necessary mandated by the DEQ. Requesting customers to boil 
the water when bacterial contamination has occurred provides an added barrier of 
public health protection. 

The BWAs that recently occurred in the city of Flint were associated with bacteria 
monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards. These advisories were 
issued by the city of Flint collaboratively in consultation with the DEQ. 

Current regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water distribution 
systems were developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have been in 
effect since 1990, and were incorporated into the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended. There are a variety of bacteria, parasites, and viruses that 
can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them in drinking water. Testing 
water for each of these potential pathogens would be difficult and expensive. Instead, 
water systems test for total coliform and E.coli. Total coliform bacteria react to water 
treatment in a manner similar to many pathogens. Therefore, the presence of total 
coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or other 
contaminants to enter the system. The absence of total conforms in the distribution 
system minimizes the likelihood that pathogens are present. E.coli is itself a pathogen, 
and its detection would be direct evidence of a health risk. 

Once a BWA has been issued, time is needed to investigate potential causes and 
implement corrective measures. The larger the water system, the more time this may 
take. Once corrective measures have been taken, samples must be collected and 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 3 


analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present. Using the most common 
analytical method, samples must be incubated for a period of 24 hours before results 
can be obtained. In situations where the bacterial contamination has been confirmed, 
two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 hours apart are normally 
obtained before canceling a BWA. Adding each of these steps together, a normal 
response period to cancel a BWA under these circumstances would be expected to take 
at least 3 to 4 days. 

Recent History of the City of Flint Water System 

Historically, the city of Flint had been a customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) while simultaneously maintaining the Flint WTP to provide 
emergency backup service using the Flint River. The WTP performed quarterly test 
operations to maintain readiness and was utilized twice in 2009, supplying water once 
for 2 days and the other for 3 days. 

In April 2013 the city of Flint notified the DWSD that it would be terminating service in 
the future and contracting for raw water service from the Karegnondi Water Authority 
(KWA). Work on the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron broke ground in June 2013 and is 
expected to be completed with connection in late 2016. 

In August 2013 Rowe Professional Services Company completed an engineering 
proposal for improvements to the Flint WTP that would allow continuous operation of 
the WTP utilizing the Flint River in lieu of continuing service from the DWSD until 
completion of the KWA pipeline. In March 2014 the city of Flint entered into a Consent 
Agreement with the DEQ regarding the Flint WTP’s lime sludge facility. In April 2014 
the DEQ issued a construction permit for improvements to the Flint WTP. On April 25, 
2014, the city of Flint began continuous operation of the WTP, using water from the Flint 
River and discontinued the purchase of water from the DWSD. 

A BWA was issued for August 1 5-20, 201 4, for a portion of the city of Flint due to 
localized detections of total coliform and E.coli bacteria. Another BWA was issued for 
September 5-9, 2014, due to localized detections of total coliform bacteria in the same 
and adjacent portions of the city of Flint. The advisory covered an area of 
approximately six square miles. The city of Flint has a total land area of just over 
34 square miles.

While many of the BWA contributing factors listed above require long-term solutions, the 
city has taken operational steps to limit the potential for a BWA to reoccur. The city has 
increased flushing of water mains to limit residence time, maintain disinfectant residual, 
and help remove buildup and deposits within the piping. The city is boosting chlorine 
disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed. The city 
continues to investigate water leaks and water main breaks and the status and condition 
of system valves.

GOVERNOR’S OFFICE BRIEFING PAPER 
CITY OF FLINT DRINKING WATER 


What contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the city of Flint? 

A number of factors, not one specific cause, likely contributed to the Boil Water 
Advisories (BWAs) in the city of Flint during August and September 2014. While use of 
the Flint River has increased the amount of natural organic matter in the city’s water, the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has performed well above treatment requirements 
for organic carbon removal. In addition, less than 20 percent of the water system was 
included in the advisory area. If treatment had been compromised, detections would 
have been widespread throughout the city, rather than in such a localized area. 

The city’s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment 
and asset management. Most of the city’s over 550 miles of water mains are now over 
75 years old and constructed of cast iron piping. Cast iron pipe is subject to internal 
corrosion, called tuberculation, which causes buildup on the pipe interior, leading to 
water quality issues, reduced flow and pressures, and leakage. Tuberculation also 
encourages the development of biofilms, layers of bacteria that attach to the interior 
pipe wall. Biofilm growth is common in areas of piping with little or no disinfectant 
residual, and together with tuberculation can clog water lines to the point of insufficient 
water pressure. 

The city has also experienced decades of a declining user base and water use 
associated with vacant homes, commercial businesses, and industrial property. 

Declining water use leads to excess residence time within the city’s distribution pipes 
and water storage facilities, accelerating tuberculation, biofilm growth, and disinfectant 
residual degradation. While the city has recently seen an infusion of funding for blight 
removal, contractors completing this work have been improperly using fire hydrants, 
causing hydraulic disturbances that dislodged and suspended settled debris, which may 
have contributed to the bacterial contamination. 

The winter of 2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water system. The 
city, which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 30 percent, has seen even 
greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold weather-related water 
main breaks and leaks. The city lacks a formal maintenance program for its over 7,250 
valves, which would normally be used to limit impacts during break repairs. Two valves 
on the transmission line used to supply the area of the BWAs were found to be closed 
during the city’s investigation, causing longer residence time, reduced disinfectant 
residual, reduced flow, and reduced pressure. One of these valves has remained 
broken. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 2 


The BWAs also occurred during the warmest and, for 2014, relatively wet periods of 
August and September. Warm weather conditions are not only more conducive to 
bacterial growth but also degrade the water’s disinfectant residual carried out from the 
WTP more quickly. Longer residence times, biofilms, and tuberculation also contribute 
to disinfectant residual degradation. Warm wet weather conditions also allow water 
contaminated with bacteria to pool around piping with leaks and breaks. 

Process for Issuance and Cancelation of a Boil Water Advisory 

There are a number of conditions that can trigger BWAs. This includes the following: 

- Bacteria Monitoring Detections - Loss of System Pressure 

- Bacteria Standards Violations - Water Main Breaks 

- Treatment System Failures - Other Interruptions in Service 

- Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has developed a policy and procedure 
regarding BWAs to help guide staff, provide consistency, and maintain public health. A 
PDF of Policy and Procedure No. ODWMA-399-022 is being forwarded with this briefing 
paper. 

BWAs may be self-initiated by the water system, issued collaboratively in consultation 
with the DEQ, or when necessary mandated by the DEQ. Requesting customers to boil 
the water when bacterial contamination has occurred provides an added barrier of 
public health protection. 

The BWAs that recently occurred in the city of Flint were associated with bacteria 
monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards. These advisories were 
issued by the city of Flint collaboratively in consultation with the DEQ. 

Current regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water distribution 
systems were developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have been in 
effect since 1990, and were incorporated into the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended. There are a variety of bacteria, parasites, and viruses that 
can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them in drinking water. Testing 
water for each of these potential pathogens would be difficult and expensive. Instead, 
water systems test for total coliform and E.coli. Total coliform bacteria react to water 
treatment in a manner similar to many pathogens. Therefore, the presence of total 
coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or other 
contaminants to enter the system. The absence of total coliforms in the distribution 
system minimizes the likelihood that pathogens are present. E.coli is itself a pathogen, 
and its detection would be direct evidence of a health risk. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper

Once a BWA has been issued, time is needed to investigate potential causes and 
implement corrective measures. The larger the water system, the more time this may 
take. Once corrective measures have been taken, samples must be collected and 
analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present. Using the most common 
analytical method, samples must be incubated for a period of 24 hours before results 
can be obtained. In situations where the bacterial contamination has been confirmed, 
two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 hours apart are normally 
obtained before canceling a BWA. Adding each of these steps together, a normal 
response period to cancel a BWA under these circumstances would be expected to take 
at least 3 to 4 days. 

Recent History of the City of Flint Water System 

Historically, the city of Flint had been a customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) while simultaneously maintaining the Flint WTP to provide 
emergency backup service using the Flint River. The WTP performed quarterly test 
operations to maintain readiness and was utilized twice in 2009, supplying water once 
for 2 days and the other for 3 days. 

In April 2013 the city of Flint notified the DWSD that it would be terminating service in 
the future and contracting for raw water service from the Karegnondi Water Authority 
(KWA). Work on the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron broke ground in June 2013 and is 
expected to be completed with connection in late 2016. 

In August 2013 Rowe Professional Services Company completed an engineering 
proposal for improvements to the Flint WTP that would allow continuous operation of 
the WTP utilizing the Flint River in lieu of continuing service from the DWSD until 
completion of the KWA pipeline. In March 2014 the city of Flint entered into a Consent 
Agreement with the DEQ regarding the Flint WTP’s lime sludge facility. In April 2014 
the DEQ issued a construction permit for improvements to the Flint WTP. On April 25, 
2014, the city of Flint began continuous operation of the WTP, using water from the Flint 
River and discontinued the purchase of water from the DWSD. 

A BWA was issued for August 1 5-20, 201 4, for a portion of the city of Flint due to 
localized detections of total coliform and E.coli bacteria. Another BWA was issued for 
September 5-9, 2014, due to localized detections of total coliform bacteria in the same 
and adjacent portions of the city of Flint. The advisory covered an area of 
approximately six square miles. The city of Flint has a total land area of just over 
34 square miles.

While many of the BWA contributing factors listed above require long-term solutions, the 
city has taken operational steps to limit the potential for a BWA to reoccur. The city has 
increased flushing of water mains to limit residence time, maintain disinfectant residual, 
and help remove buildup and deposits within the piping. The city is boosting chlorine 
disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed. The city 
continues to investigate water leaks and water main breaks and the status and condition

A Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Policy and Procedure cannot establish regulatory 
requirements for parties outside of the DEQ. This document provides direction to DEQ staff 
regarding the implementation of rules and laws administered by the DEQ. It is merely 
explanatory; does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public; 
and does not have the force and effect of law. 


INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, OR ISSUE: 

Community water systems are expected to provide customers with a continuous supply of water 
that meets both federal and state drinking water standards. However, there may be 
circumstances when the public must be notified that the water may not be safe. In these 
circumstances, a boil water advisory may be issued to prevent illness from known or suspected 
microbiological contamination. This policy is to provide guidance to Office of Drinking Water 
and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) drinking water program staff on advising community water 
system personnel when to issue and rescind a boil water advisory, the appropriate content, and 
the manner and method of delivery. 

AUTHORITY: 

Administrative rule R 325.10401a promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 

1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399), being Michigan Compiled Law 325.1001 et seq., requires 
public notification for violations of maximum contaminant levels and treatment techniques plus 
other situations as determined by the DEQ. Each public notice is required to state what actions 
consumers should take during a violation, which may include a statement recommending water 
customers boil all water used for consumption until further notice. 

In addition, R 325.1 1207 allows the DEQ to require the supplier of water to provide notice to 
customers or users that include any precautionary measures deemed necessary when an 
interruption in water service occurs, which could include low, zero, or negative pressure events. 

Furthermore, R 325. 1 2303 requires a supplier of water to include in their contingency planning a 
description of precautions or measures to be taken to protect the health of those customers or 
users that may be affected by an emergency. R 325.12304 also requires a supplier of water to 
notify the DEQ when an emergency is discovered and how the supply will notify its customers or 
users. While the content of this notification to customers or users may vary depending upon 
individual circumstances, each notification to customers or users must state what actions or 
precautions they should take, which may include a statement to boil ail water used for 
consumption until further notice.

STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT: 

DEQ staff met with Municipal Utilities Directors to seek input on issues that were subsequently 
addressed in this policy and procedure. 

DEFINITIONS: 

“Boil Water Advisory (BWA)” - A written or verbal advisory issued by the community water 
system or DEQ notifying the users of the water system that the water is or may be contaminated 
and advising them to boil the water prior to using it for drinking or cooking. 

“Community Water Supply (CWS)" - A public water supply (PWS) that provides year-round 
service to not fewer than 15 living units, or that regularly provides year-round service to not 
fewer than 25 residents. Examples include municipalities, such as cities, villages, and 
townships; apartment complexes; manufactured housing communities; condominiums; and 
nursing homes. 

“Complete Loss of Pressure” - Sustained negative pressures or pressure below five psi in any 
portion of a distribution system. It does not include instantaneous low or negative pressure 
occurring from pressure surges caused by pump cycling, valve operation, or other water 
hammer events, 

“Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)” - The maximum permissible level of a contaminant in 
water that is delivered to any user of a PWS. 

"Repeat Sample” - A sample that is collected and analyzed in response to a previous coliform- 
positive sample. 

“Routine Sample” - A water sample that is collected and analyzed to meet the monitoring 
requirements for total coliform, as outlined in the written sampling plan. 

"Tier 1 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 24 hours after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has significant potential to 
have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure. A Tier 1 
Public Notice also requires the supplier to initiate consultation with the DEQ as soon as practical 
but not later than 24 hours after the supplier learns of the violation or situation. Examples of 
these violations or situations include: 

1 . A violation of the Total Coliform MCL when fecal or E.coli are present in the distribution 
system; 

2. A violation of the treatment technique requirement resulting from a single exceedance of 
the maximum allowable turbidity limit; 

3. An occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak; 

4. A failure or significant interruption in key water treatment processes; 

5. A disruption of the water supply or distribution system; and

6. Other violations or situations as determined by the DEQ on a case-by-case basis. A 

violation or situation that requires a Tier 1 Public Notice also requires the supplier to consult 
with the DEQ to determine additional public notice requirements, including the timing, form, 
manner, frequency and content of the notice designed to reach all persons served, and any 
repeat notices or directions. At a minimum, one or more of the following forms of delivery 
must be used: 

a. Appropriate broadcast media: 

b. Posting of the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the area served by the system; 

c. Hand delivery of the notice to persons served by the system; or 

d. Another delivery method approved by the DEQ. 

Within 10 days of completing the Tier 1 Public Notice, the supplier shall submit to the DEQ a 
certification that it fully complied with the public notification requirements, including a 
representative copy of the type of notice distributed to persons served by the system and to the 
media. 

“Tier 2 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 30 days after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has the potential to have 
serious adverse effects on human health. Examples of these violations or situations include: 

1 . All violations of MCL, maximum residual disinfectant level, and treatment technique 
requirements except where the DEQ determines a Tier 1 notice is required. 

2. Violations of monitoring and testing procedure requirements, taking into account potential 
health impacts and persistence of the violation; and 

3. Failure to comply with a variance or exemption. 

For a Tier 2 Public Notice, the DEQ may, on a case-by-case basis, grant extensions in writing 
for up to three months from the date the supplier learns of the violation or situation, for reasons 
such as coordinating with billing cycles or if the violation or situation was quickly resolved and 
no longer poses any risk to the persons served. A Tier 2 Public Notice shall be repeated every 
three months as long as the violation or situation exists. A Tier 2 Public Notice and any repeat 
notices shall be in a form and issued in a manner that is reasonably calculated to reach persons 
served in the required time period. At a minimum, the notice shali be provided: 

1 . By mail or direct delivery to each customer receiving a bill and to other service connections 
to which water is delivered by the supplier, and 

2. By other methods reasonably calculated to reach other persons not receiving a bill, such as 
apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients and prison inmates. Other 
methods may include: 

a. Publication in a local newspaper 

b. Delivery of multiple copies to apartment complexes and manufactured housing 
communities 

c. Posting in public places or on the Internet 

d. Delivery to community organizations

“Treatment Technique (TT)” - Minimum treatment requirement or a necessary methodology or 
technology that is employed by a supplier of water for the control of the chemical, physical, 
biological, or radiological characteristics of a PWS. 

POLICY: 

A 8WA may be issued for a variety of reasons when microbial contamination is known or 
suspected. Total Coliform Rule (TCR) MCL violations, surface water TT violations, low or loss 
of pressure events, and waterborne disease outbreaks are circumstances when a BWA may be 
issued. Each of these situations is discussed in detail below. However, these situations are not 
the only times a BWA can or should be issued, Each incident must be handled on a case-by- 
case basis, using professional judgment to evaluate the circumstances in each situation. 

Finally, there may be situations when water systems experience contamination that is not 
microbial, but chemical due to a chemical spill or backflow due to a cross connection. In these 
cases, a notice to customers could include “Do Not Use” language since boiling the water may 
not remove the contamination. 

Types of Incidents: 

1 . Violation of a Drinking Water Standard 
a. TCR MCL Violations 

An acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of coliform 
organisms in both a routine and a follow-up repeat sample in the same monitoring 
period, and either analysis (routine or repeat) is also positive for fecal or E.coli. Because 
this MCL violation confirms the presence of a more direct connection to contamination, 
these violations warrant issuance of a BWA, unless there are unique circumstances. 

A non-acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of 
coliform bacteria in 2 or more samples in the same monitoring period for a supplier 
collecting less than 40 samples per month, or in more than 5 percent of the samples for 
a supplier collecting 40 or more samples per month, and the criteria for an acute 
violation did not occur, i.e., fecal coliform or E.coli were NOT detected present in either a 
routine or repeat sample. For example, a system that collects 5 samples per week for a 
total of 20 per month may have 1 sample report positive for total coliform or fecal I E.coli 
during the first week, but all repeat samples report negative for coliform. If another 
sample in a subsequent week also reports total or fecal/E.coli positive, but again, all 
repeat samples are coliform-negative, then a non-acute TCR MCL violation has occurred 
because 2 or more samples reported positive for coliform, but no fecai coliform or E.coli 
were detected in both a routine and a repeat sample.

When a non-acute violation occurs, staff should evaluate possible sources of 
contamination. If a source is identified that is considered likely to contribute disease 
causing organisms or result in water of questionable quality still being distributed, a BWA 
should be instituted. Examples of contaminant sources that would elevate the public 
health risk include, but are not limited to: 

• flooding of the wells 

• failure of the treatment system 

• recent construction activity in the distribution system 

• vermin (birds, rodents, etc.) activity in storage tanks 

• system-wide or extensive pressure loss in the distribution system 

Even if the source of contamination is not easily identified, a BWA may be appropriate 
for a non-acute TCR violation if the violation is widespread or ongoing. A BWA shall be 
instituted if monitoring indicates E. coli or fecal coliform contamination unless unusual 
circumstances warrant consideration, such as the absence of any coliform in repeat 
samples, or when staff are assured that the contamination has been eliminated before 
confirmation results are available. 

However, not every TCR MCL violation must result in a BWA, There may be a few 
exceptions when there is a TCR MCL violation but a BWA is not needed. For example, 
a violation may be declared in situations where samples collected on different days from 
widely dispersed locations report coliform present even though repeat samples do not 
show positive results. In this case, the sampling results may constitute a MCL violation, 
but a BWA may not be necessary. 

If a BWA is deemed necessary by the ODWMA, it should be issued as soon as possible 
but no later than 24 hours after the system learns of the violation. Because violation of 
an MCL results in required public notification (PN) per the PN Rule, the water supply 
may issue the PN and BWA simultaneously in one document (highly recommended) and 
must meet all the requirements of a Tier 1 PN and include BWA language. 

After measures have been taken to eliminate the source(s) of contamination, such as 
initiating or increasing chlorine feed rates and system flushing, additional sampling must 
be conducted. Raw water bacteriological sampling is also encouraged to eliminate the 
raw water as the possible source of contamination. For MCL violations, the BWA can be 
rescinded after the analyses of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the 
absence of coliform bacteria. The number of samples in each set should be a minimum 
of five samples, but can be decreased or increased based on system size or the extent 
of the affected area. Systems are encouraged to use routine sample sites if available 
and to use extra care if routine sites are not available.

b. Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) TT Violations 
SWTR TT violations include: 

• exceedance of turbidity standards at filter confluence point 

• failure to meet disinfection contact time requirements (C*T) 

• failure to meet disinfection residual standards 

Upon determination of an SWTR TT violation, ODWMA staff must determine if the 
violation poses a threat to public health. For example, if the turbidity levels at the filter 
confluence point were found to have exceeded 0.3 nephlometric turbidity units (NTUs) in 
95 percent of the samples in a two-month period, an SWTR TT violation has occurred. 
Based upon a review of plant performance and consultation with program managers, 
staff may determine that no significant health risk was posed and no BWA is necessary. 
However, the water supply must still issue a Tier 2 PN within 30 days of the violation. 

On the other hand, a BWA is likely to be necessary for a treatment plant that gets 
overwhelmed by excessive runoff and reports a turbidity level in excess of 1,0 NTU at 
the filter confluence point for a four-hour period. 

If the TT violation is ongoing or prolonged, or the ODWMA determines a significant 
public health risk is posed, ODWMA staff may elevate the PN to Tier 1 status, which 
must be issued within 24 hours and include BWA language. After appropriate measures 
have been taken to reduce or eliminate any health risk, additional monitoring must be 
conducted. Appropriate measures may include increasing coagulant dose, increasing 
chlorine residuals through the treatment plant, backwashing filters more often and 
flushing key system components. In this case, a BWA can be rescinded after analyses 
of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the absence of coliform bacteria. 
The number of samples in each set should be a minimum of five samples, but can be 
decreased or increased based on type and severity of the TT violation. 

Surface water plants utilizing conventional or direct filtration must add a primary 
coagulant under R 325.1 1008. Failure to add a primary coagulant is a violation of 
Act 399, and may also contribute to a TT violation under R 325.1061 1 (Filtration and 
Disinfection) which requires 3-log inactivation of giardia and 4-log inactivation of viruses. 
In these cases, ODWMA staff will have to determine if the violation poses a threat to 
public health and whether other actions are necessary, such as requiring a BWA. 

Factors to consider if a BWA is necessary would include chlorine residual concentrations 
throughout the treatment plant, raw water quality, C*T compliance, plus individual filter 
effluent and combined filter effluent turbidity levels. 

2. Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

Waterborne disease outbreaks can be declared by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Department of Community Health, a local health department, or other public

health institutions. If an outbreak is declared, the ODWMA will work with the declaring 
agency to ensure affected community public water supplies take appropriate measures to 
mitigate public exposure. These measures will include appropriate public notification, 
including instructions to boil water if appropriate. The ODWMA will allow the water supply to 
rescind the notification when the agency declaring the outbreak indicates it is safe to do so 
as the result of additional monitoring. 

3. Interruptions in Service 

a. Negative or Complete Loss of Pressure 

A complete loss of pressure or negative pressure in the distribution system must result in 
a BWA being issued to all water customers in the impacted area. After pressure is 
restored and the system recovers (tanks are filling and enough sources are operating to 
ensure pressures do not drop again), the affected area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples must be taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution 
system remains free of coliform contamination. The number of samples will vary 
depending on the size of the system and the extent of the area impacted. For very small 
systems that experience a power failure that results in a complete loss of pressure 
throughout the distribution system, a minimum of three samples should be collected. If 
applicable, chlorine residual measurements should be taken to ensure that an adequate 
disinfectant residual is present. If possible, chlorine dosages and residuals should be 
increased by 1 to 2 parts per million during this period as a corrective and preventive 
measure. If the first round of sampling does not detect coliform bacteria, the advisory 
may be rescinded. However, if the first round of sampling detects coliform bacteria, 
additional flushing should be conducted in the area where the positive coliform samples 
were collected and a second round of coliform samples collected from the area. The 
BWA should remain in effect until safe coliform sample results are obtained. 

b. Low Pressure Events 

Low pressure events might not result in a BWA. Low pressure is considered a drop in 
pressure below 20 psi but greater than 5 psi. A drop in water pressure in a distribution 
system could allow contamination to enter the water system through backflow by 
backpressure or backsiphonage. The decision to issue a BWA should be made on a 
case-by-case basis and be based upon professional judgment of all available data that 
may indicate the extent of the problem, such as: 

• Geographical extent of the pressure loss 

• Nature of the service area (residential vs. commercial/industriai) 

• Duration of the low pressure condition 

• Disinfection practices of the water system 

• Relative elevation differences in the service area 

• Status of the local cross connection control program

• Age and condition of the underground piping 

• Amount of underground piping located in areas of a high groundwater table 

• Ability and willingness of the operators to rapidly apply chlorine to the system or 
distribute an increased chlorine residual throughout the affected area 

After normal pressure is restored, the impacted area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution system is free 
of any bacteriological contamination. The collection of coliform samples after low 
pressure events is not absolutely required, but may be recommended based on the 
factors above. 

c. Water Main Breaks or Repairs 

A BWA may be issued during water main breaks and after the break has been repaired. 
Whether or not to issue a BWA will depend on the location and severity of the break and, 
more importantly, a decision based on sound engineering judgment that the integrity of 
the water system has been maintained. If at all possible, repairs should be performed 
under reduced or low pressure by closing the closest valves on each side of the break 
just enough to reduce the flow so the repairs can be made under pressure while the 
water flowing from the break is diverted away from the excavation to maintain clean 
sanitary conditions. If the water main can be repaired under pressure, and no 
nonpotable water, soil, or other potential contaminants entered the main during the 
break and repair process, then a BWA is not necessary. If the water main that was 
removed from service is flushed, disinfected, and sampled in accordance with AWWA 
Standard C651 before being placed back into service, a BWA does not need to be 
issued. 

If a water main break results in a complete loss of pressure before, during, or after the 
repair is made, a BWA must be issued to al! customers in the affected area. The BWA 
should remain in effect until the area is flushed, chlorine residuals are reestablished (if 
applicable), and sample results do not detect coliform bacteria. 

Content and Delivery of a BWA 


If the ODWMA determines a BWA is necessary, the water supply must issue the advisory as 
soon as practical, but not later than 24 hours after being advised to do so. The supply must 
make a good faith attempt to notify all customers in the affected area. Appropriate methods of 
distribution are situation specific, but may include radio or television broadcasts, hand delivery, 
and/or posting in conspicuous locations throughout the area. Delivery requirements as detailed 
in the PN Rule should be used to determine appropriate delivery methods. 

Although there are content requirements for public notification under the PN Rule, there are no 
requirements specific to boil water language. To ensure all appropriate information is 
transmitted to the customers, a BWA should include the same content elements as required for

public notification under the PN Rule. If a BWA is issued as the result of an MCL violation and 
the water supply issues the BWA in conjunction with the required PN (highly recommended), the 
content MUST meet all PN Rule content, delivery, and reporting requirements. 

The ODWMA boil water language is consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
policy that requires water be brought to a boil and allowed to boil for one minute before use. 

The language also suggests the use of bottled water as an alternative to boiling and describes 
the circumstances under which boiled or bottled water should be used. 

Staff should notify the appropriate local health department and the Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development, Food and Dairy Division, whenever a BWA is issued or rescinded. 
These agencies may receive calls from concerned customers or be involved in oversight of 
facilities impacted by the boil advisory and, therefore, need to be aware of the situation. 

Several BWA templates have been created and are available to ODWMA staff on the DEQ 
Intranet. To ensure consistency and inclusion of ail necessary content, these templates should 
be used as the basis for PNs and/or a BWA. Available templates include, but are not limited to: 

• Advisory for a TCR MCL. 

• Advisory for a low/no pressure event. 

• Notification for cancellation of a BWA. 

PROCEDURES: 

WHO I DOES WHAT 

Public Water Supply Notify DEQ of results in a timely manner as required by law and follow 

through with appropriate actions. 

District Staff Respond to all TCR and TT violations plus complete loss of pressure 

events in a timely manner and determine whether a BWA needs to be 
issued. 

• If needed, assist supply in drafting BWA and determining most 
appropriate method of delivery with approval from the District 
Supervisor. 

• If needed, assist the supply in determining actions to remove 
the possible contamination including steps needed to rescind 

the BWA. 

District Staff Provide on-site technical assistance for acute TCR MCL violations 

and other boil water situations as appropriate. 

District Supervisors Assist District Staff in the all matters pertaining to issuing a BWA.

Governor's Flint Water Advisory Task Force - Logistics Update 


Ladies and Gentlemen, 

This is to provide a brief update on some of the arrangements that we are making to conduct the work of the Governor's Flint 

Water Advisory Task Force (FWATF): 

• To simplify communications among task force members, the Task Force has decided to close the Basecamp project 
that was initially set up for the entirety of the roster provided earlier. The Basecamp project for the FWATF will be 
maintained for task force members. Accordingly, to archive documents for the FWATF's review and consideration, 
please e-mail to me (erothste@izr g- itd.com) or any one of the FWATF members and we will arrange for posting to 
Basecamp. If you have large documents or a large number of documents, please contact me and we can arrange for 
posting to Dropbox. 

o (This is why the project has not been accessible in the event that you have tried to load documents) 

• I thought it might be helpful for the FWATF to develop a brief status report on our activities — interviews and 
meetings conducted and scheduled, documents collected, etc. - perhaps on a bi-weekly or even weekly basis. So, 
unless there is objection or concerns, I will try to craft a reporting template for discussion by the FWATF at our next 
regularly scheduled meeting. If you have suggestions for this reporting, please send along. 

• We have put on our respective calendars a weekly meeting, generously hosted at PSC offices, on Wednesday 
mornings. We are also attempting to schedule a "listening session" in Flint in the next few weeks as well as briefing 
sessions with MDEQ and MHHS. 

My apologies for any confusion regarding the Basecamp set-up. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

DRAFT 



April 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
111 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, MI 48909 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 2011. Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and I feel that 
the financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position 
as Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, I was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of PA 
436 of 2012. I am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint: my predecessors were Michael K. Brow n (PA 
4 and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major 
steps toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and 
financial best practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and 
levels of service provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 

Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, 
characterized by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and 
unsustainable legacy costs. At the conclusion of FY12. the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager 
was appointed, the City's General Fund deficit stood at $19. 1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8.8 
million: and cash flow was $13 million, or less than one month's expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities 
were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire: a special assessment for street 
lighting; waste collection was changed to a fee for service from a millage rate: and increases in utility 
rates to among the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public 
safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrank by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General 
Fund deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan 
Board. City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have 
been enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the 
requirement for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan: requirement for creation and 
maintenance of a biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund 
balance reserve, including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a 


1 



requirement to begin funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing 
ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over 
daily activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City 
operations have been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no 
longer being done internally, 91 1 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 
2015, and the City-funded 68 l District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 
67 th District Court in January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the 
Karcgondi Water Authority instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective 
bargaining contracts have also been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the 
stage for permanent reductions in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the 
level of parks maintenance. Senior Centers are now am by independent non-profit organizations, 
with reduced assistance from the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private 
operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new 
Master Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has 
been completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new 
zoning ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces 
significantly engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the 
Flint City Council, w ith the support of the May or. 

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current 
Charter and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which 
will be elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current 
Strong Mayor form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Elurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 


Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work 
on the part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit 
over its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is 
currently operating under a judge's order which allows modification of the City’s historical level 
of health care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 


2 



• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a 
long term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently 
provides is not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, 
study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special niillagcs financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint's total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This niillage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago. arc 
expiring in 2017, and w ithout renewal, the resulting level of public safety sen ices, even w ith the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unw orkable. This w as recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 100 more officers on the street than Flint does. 

• Equally important to providing State support in the form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City’s lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City’s 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 



Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of PA 436 of 2012. the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, I am prepared to say that I 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 21(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved. I recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. I believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to frill local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 


3 



If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to 
the historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of 
City leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 


Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

April 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
111 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, MI 48909 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 2011. Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and I feel that 
the financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position 
as Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, I was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of PA 
436 of 2012. I am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint: my predecessors were Michael K. Brow n (PA 
4 and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major 
steps toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and 
financial best practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and 
levels of service provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 

Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, 
characterized by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and 
unsustainable legacy costs. At the conclusion of FY12. the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager 
was appointed, the City's General Fund deficit stood at $19. 1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8.8 
million: and cash flow was $13 million, or less than one month's expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities 
were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire: a special assessment for street 
lighting; waste collection was changed to a fee for service from a millage rate: and increases in utility 
rates to among the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public 
safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrank by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General 
Fund deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan 
Board. City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have 
been enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the 
requirement for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan: requirement for creation and 
maintenance of a biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund 
balance reserve, including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a 


1 



requirement to begin funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing 
ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over 
daily activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City 
operations have been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no 
longer being done internally, 91 1 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 
2015, and the City-funded 68 l District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 
67 th District Court in January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the 
Karcgondi Water Authority instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective 
bargaining contracts have also been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the 
stage for permanent reductions in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the 
level of parks maintenance. Senior Centers are now am by independent non-profit organizations, 
with reduced assistance from the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private 
operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new 
Master Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has 
been completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new 
zoning ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces 
significantly engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the 
Flint City Council, w ith the support of the May or. 

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current 
Charter and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which 
will be elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current 
Strong Mayor form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Elurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 


Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work 
on the part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit 
over its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is 
currently operating under a judge's order which allows modification of the City’s historical level 
of health care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 


2 



• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a 
long term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently 
provides is not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, 
study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Gcncscc County in the creation of the KWA w ill 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special niillagcs financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint's total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This niillage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago. arc 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety sen ices, even w ith the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unw orkable. This w as recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 100 more officers on the street than Flint does. 

• Equally important to providing State support in the form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City’s lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City’s 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 

Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of PA 436 of 2012. the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, I am prepared to say that I 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 21(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved. I recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. I believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to frill local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 


3 



If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to 
the historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of 
City leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 


Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

Re: Comment sought on Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State of Michigan, City of Flint 


I agree. 

Given the Flint River was already set as a backup source for Flint, did the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
need to give the go ahead to the city to start using the Flint River as its source of drinking water, or was DEQ simply in 
the position to certify testing of the source for use?

Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State 
of Michigan, City of Flint 

State, city failed to release documents sought in FOIA request 

LANSING — State Representative Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) announced 
earlier today that he is filing suit against the state of Michigan and the city of Flint 
to force them to release public documents he requested last month under the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

"It's an absolute shame that I have to file suit to force our government to 
comply with the law," Phelps said. "I was shocked at their response, because prior 
to receiving the denials, officials from both the city and state had told me that not 
only did documents exist, but they would be happy to share them with me." 

On Sept. 4 of this year, Phelps requested that the city and state turn over 
all documents and emails regarding the permit and application process that Flint's 
emergency manager was required to complete before the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality gave the go ahead to the city to start using the Flint 


2 



River as its source of drinking water. Late last month, the state and the city both 
denied Phelps' request, saying that no such documents exist. 

In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also 
quoted in several articles on Mlive.com , making comments about the permit 
application process for Flint to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit's 
system to the Flint River. 

"I want to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality of 
the river water before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent 
actions, it almost seems they knew a lot more than they are letting on to," Phelps 
said. "Flint residents deserve better than this, they deserve to know the truth 
about the decisions that were made, and if I have to fight this in court to get the 
truth, so be it."

NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 

TO: Randall Byrne, State Administrative Manager; Office of Fiscal Responsibility 

FROM: Eric Cline, Department Manager; Office of Fiscal Responsibility 

SUBJECT : Questions Regarding City of Flint Water System 

DATE: July 28, 2015 


RICK SNYDER 
GOVERNOR 


State of Michigan 

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY 

Lansing 


At a July 23, 2015 meeting, Deputy Treasurer Workman posed several questions regarding the City of 
Flint’s water system. This memo is a response to those questions. 

The annual cost to the City of Flint to reconnect to the DWSD system 

In a March 3, 2015 memo to Deputy Treasurer Workman, Emergency Manager Ambrose noted that he 
had been informed by DWSD that such a reconnection would immediately levy a fixed cost on the City of 
$10. 1 -million per year. 

Actual water purchases would be in addition to the fixed cost fee and would be dependent upon actual 
usage, but the annual cost was estimated to be as high as $1 -million/month; making the entire total of a 
one year connection back to DWSD as high as $22-million. This cost would be reduced to approximately 
$ 19-million/year once the City’s $3-million annual expense of operating the water system itself was 
offset. 

These calculations were outlined in a March 2015 memo from the Emergency Manager to Deputy 
Treasurer Workman and update cost projections provided in a February 1 1, 2015 memo to Chief Deputy 
Treasurer Tom Saxton. 

The Emergency Manager also stated his concern that for the City to be able to pay these costs that water 
rates charged to Flint residents would need to be increased by a minimum of 30%. Water rate increases 
between 2010 and 2015 are illustrated in the table attached. 

In addition, DWSD was requiring that the City of Flint negotiate a 30-year contract for the provision of 
back-up services. 

The City of Flint’s degree of participation in the management of the KWA system 

Mayor Dayne Walling is the City's official representative to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). 

The participation of the Mayor as the official representative for the City of Flint is established in the 
KWA Articles of Incorporation. Mayor Walling is the current Chair of the Board of the KWA Board of 
Directors. 

Continued use of Flint River water after the City is connected to the KWA system 


P.O. BOX 30716 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909 
www.michigan.gov/treasury • (517) 373-3200 




Page 2 


The City Administrator has confirmed that once the City is fully connected to the KWA system they will 
no longer continue to use Flint River water. 

The Flint River, however, will be the City’s primary back-up water source in the event that a major 
disruption in the KWA system temporarily prevents the City from receiving water. 

The process used to hire Veolia 

Veolia responded on January 29, 2015, to a Request for Proposal issued by the City of Flint. Emergency 
Manager Ambrose made the final decision to retain Veolia. 

The importance of hydrant flushing 

Fire hydrant flushing is an important part of distribution system maintenance. It is useful in determining 
flow conditions in water mains. 

According to information from the American Water Works Association (AWWA), there are two types of 
hydrant flushing utilized. The most comprehensive method is fire-flow testing. 

Fire-flow testing requires hydrants to be opened, flushed, pressure and flow data to be collected and the 
potential fire flow at a particular point in a water main to be determined. 

Hydrant flushing pennits any debris to be cleared from a water main. They process of collecting fire flow 
data allows the determination of water pressure and flow capabilities for fighting fires at any location 
w ithin a distribution system. It can also help determine the general condition of a system by detecting 
reduced water flows in a given area. 

Status of the GAC carbon filter installation 

Six of the twelve filters will be operational by no later than the first week of August. 

Activation of the filters is expected to immediately drop the levels of TTHM within the system. 

The remaining six filters are projected to be installed and operational by the end of August. 

Status of the DuPont Street Water Main Replacement 

After an internal review, the City made the decision to rebid this project. 

There were multiple reasons for this decision, which included interference with current road projects, the 
determination that project bids were too high, and bidding timelines which were not favorable to secure 
quality bids or contractors. 

This project will be rebid by the City later this fiscal year. 

If you have any questions or need additional information on this topic, let me know. Thank you.

Subject: RE: Director's Office Assignment -- Flint - need update asap 

I apologize for the delay in responding more specifically to this assignment, it took some time to review our 
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention program data to see if it might contribute to the understanding of the 
situation in Flint with their water supply. Here is what we found: 

We looked at lead testing results for May 2014-April 2015, which is the 12 month time frame just after Flint 
started drawing their water from the river (water source changed in April 2014). 

We compared lead testing rates and lead testing results to the same time frame for the previous 3 years, to 
see if there were any patterns that suggested that there were increased rates of lead poisoning after the 
water supply was switched. Per the attached charts - 

• Lead testing rates remained about the same from year to year (chart on the right). 

• There was a spike in elevated blood lead tests from July-September 2014 (chart on the left, gold line). 


l 



• However that pattern was not terribly different from what we saw in the previous three years, especially 
in 2011-2012 (we are working with our Epidemiologist to statistically verify any significant differences). 

• We commonly see a 'seasonal effect' with lead, related to people opening and closing windows more 
often in the summer, which disturbs old deteriorating paint on the windows, sills and sashes. Window fans 
frequently blow and spread the lead dust from the deteriorating paint to other parts of the room/house. We 
suspect that the summer data spike may be related to this effect. 

• If the home water supply lines and/or river water were contributing to elevated blood lead tests, we 
expected that the increased rates would extend beyond the summer, but they drop quite a bit from 
September to October, stayed low over the winter, and are just starting to tail up again in the spring of 2015. 

So upon review, we don't believe our data demonstrates an increase in lead poisoning rates that might be 
attributable to the change in water source for Flint. We recognize that lead exposure via the water is only a 
small piece of what may be happening for families in Flint, however, we hope the information is helpful.

I think this information is very helpful. It will not answer the main question about the quality of the water (DEQ is 
working on that through Brad I believe), and the color and smeli of the present water, but it does get us to the answers 
to the less subjective issues. Frankly, the only way the issues will be totally resolved is when the KWA comes on line and 
the water is perceived to be cleaner and healthier. 

I am somewhat surprised that the leadership in Flint has not responded better to the community questions, which don't 
seem unreasonable at all. Seems like Harvey has a better network into some of the neighborhoods than the city 
does. The KWA PR department definitely needs to do some outreach or they're headed down the same road as 
DWSD. Do you know if they go out on a regular basis to the community and talk about the rates, costs, etc.?

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council March 25, may have set in motion the end to 

Flint paying to get its water from Detroit 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for 
treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the 
Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department Of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per 
day from the Flint River. 


Tuesday's meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 
“We got there," Councilman Joshua Freeman said, "That's the important thing.” 


There were more than 50 people at Monday's meeting. 

"Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion art: the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca 
Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition eyecdti ^liililllil "If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at 


risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs." 



Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste 
advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 


Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Hint has an emergency financial mana|ll 
All expenditures oyer £50,000 must be approved. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water 
service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $1,9 million overelgHt^ieirs by getting water from the Kwa, 

’Tt's a historic njght in the City of less with the capacity level approved by city 

council because there wifi be increased treatment cost for toe 111111111111 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work 
done at Flint's water plant. 

Flint's water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only 
operates four times per year. 

Councilman Bryant Holden was the lone dissenting vote* 

"It was a protest vote," Holden said. "I knew they had enough votes. I just fee Mike the Flint River is our best option." 


Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint 
and Lapeer.

GENESEE COUNTY, MI — The state has approved a critical permit that allows the Karegiiondi 
Water Authority to tap into Lake Huron with a 1.5-mile underground intake. 


But water authority officials are still waiting for Flint to decide if it will he part of it. 


ConslTueiion on the Intake — estimated to cost $27 million — might mark the no-tuming-back 
point for the massive project, and county Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said other developments 
make it necessary Flint to make a final decision on its involvement in the next few months. 


As control of Flint has shifted from mayors and city councils to emergency managers, the city has 
never committed to buying a minimum volume of water from the KWA. 

"The only question at this point really is whether Flint is going to be a partner," said Wright, who has 
met with emergency financial manager Ed Kurtz and wants to resolve the question before Kurtz 
leaves his position — something likely to happen soon after the November election. 

"I'd say we have a couple of months here," Wright said of Flint's deadline. He described Kurtz as 
positive about the city's potential involvement but said, "There's still some questions Flint is working 
on with Detroit and Lansing.” 


Kurtz said he can't predict what will happen. 


"We're looking at all our options," Kurtz said Friday. 

County Commissioner Ted Henry, D-Clayton Twp., said regardless of the city's participation, the 
pipeline can be built by the remaining partners: Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties and the city of 
Lapeer, 


The answer is yes," Henry said. "It will be a little different but it can go, 




The drain commissioner said construction of the pipeline intake, which has already been designed, is 
expected to start this year, after the job is put out for bids and borrowing is authorized by the county 
Board of Commissioners, 

Building the intake will be specialized work, part of which must be done from a barge, and will require 
building tunnels below the sand bo ttom of the lake and laying an 8 4 -inch pipe below the surface of 
the water. 

In addition to the state Department of Environmental Quality permit to build the intake, the KWA 
also needs approval from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Wright said. 


A. 45-day public comment period on the intake permit has passed and county officials said they expect 
the permit to be approved within two weeks. 

Among other recent developments in the pipeline project: 

® The Genesee County Water and Waste Advisory Committee, made up of elected and appointed 
city, township and village officials, has voted unanimously to set a date for accepting public 
bids to build the intake. 

* Tire same committee has approved negotiating a contract with Wade Trim to act as program 
manager for the pipeline project once all necessary permits have been received. 

® The county has revised its estimate on the cost of the intake portion of the pipeline from $40 
million to $27 million. 


Wright said his office is ready to negotiate a contract for Wade Trim to oversee the pipeline work, and 
said he expects six or seven engineering and surveying companies to assist in getting the job done. 


County officials count those jobs among the 1,000 that they say will he created by building the 
pipeline. 

"1 want to use local (people) wherever possible and keep the money here," Wright said. 

The drain commissioner said the selection of Wade Trim is important to the city of Flint because it 
signals the start of" engineering, which includes decisions about the size of pumps, motors and pipes 
that will be used to build the pipeline. 


Flint officials have options, including the use of Flint River water, or continuing to purchase wafer 
from the city of Detroit, 



Wright said the only choice for the rest of the county is build the pipeline or sign a 30-year contract 
with Detroit, 

A KWA study claims that continuing to buy water from Detroit will cost the region $2.1 billion during 
the next 25 years. By building a pipeline, that cost would be $1,9 billion over the same period, the 
KWA Web site says. 

After the initial 25-year period, the cost of water would be less than 25 percent of the projected cost of 
water form Detroit, according to KWA.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Comprehensive action plan 
will help Flint residents address water concerns 

Collaborative effort with state, federal and city leaders focuses on testing, assistance 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint residents need to have access to safe, clean, water now and long into the 
future, Gov. Rick Snyder said, announcing a comprehensive action plan created with state, 
federal and city leaders to address concerns about drinking water. 

The water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to drink, but some families with lead 
plumbing in their homes or service connections could experience higher levels of lead in the 
water that comes out of their faucets. 

The action plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional precautions for families 
with lead plumbing in their homes, and providing long-term solutions to address the city’s water 
infrastructure challenges. The plan was created at Snyder’s direction by the Michigan 
Departments of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Health and Human Services (DHHS), the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the city of Flint. 

“We are focused on helping ensure safe, clean, accessible drinking water and addressing and 
mitigating concerns and protecting public health,” Snyder said. “Today’s action plan builds upon 
ongoing work with local, state and federal agencies and our partnership with city and community 
leaders. Together, we are working to ensure that all Flint residents have accurate information 
and know that help is available to address potential problems.” 

The city and the state also are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that 
leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all 
residents. The plan includes: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately to ensure that drinking water is safe, with 
testing also available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

• Offering free water testing to Flint residents to assure their drinking water is safe. 

• Providing free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state 
assistance programs. 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes. 




• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines. 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee to ensure the best 
technology, practices and science are being followed by adding an expert from the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development to the group. 

• Naming Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services, as the Flint drinking water public health adviser. 

• Boosting a comprehensive lead education program to make sure residents have detailed 
information about how to protect themselves and their homes. 

Residents can have their water tested by calling 81 0-787-6537 and pressing 1 , or emailing 
flintwater@cityofflint.com . The DEQ is covering the cost of this testing. 

State leaders have been working closely with state and federal lawmakers to tap resources at 
all levels of government to address concerns. 

State health experts said there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in 
some specific communities. Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels of 
children in Flint have followed an expected seasonal trend. While this analysis for Flint as a 
whole remains true, a comprehensive and detailed review breaking down data by ZIP codes 
with the city revealed that MDHHS data is consistent with a study presented recently by Hurley 
Children’s Hospital. 

“While we cannot conclusively say that the water source change is the sole cause of the 
increase, this analysis supports our efforts as we take active steps to reduce all potential lead 
exposures in Flint,” MDHHS Director Nick Lyon said. “As part of this, we are working closely 
with our public and private partners to provide Flint residents on MDHHS assistance programs 
with free water filters and inform families about the steps they can take to reduce all lead 
exposures in their home.” 

As a part of the action plan, MDHHS is making National Sanitation Foundation certified water 
filters available to clients who are active Family Independence Program, Food Assistance 
Program, Child Development and Care or Social Security Insurance recipients. 

“This action plan offers concrete steps we will take in a local, state and federal partnership to 
ensure all Flint residents have safe water to drink,” DEQ Director Dan Wyant said. “The DEQ 
will work closely with the city to gather further data to ensure the water that leaves Flint’s system 
as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe to drink.”

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan 
Talking Points 

Overall Messaging 

• Repeated testing shows the water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to 
drink and meets all federal guidelines, including lead. 

• After the switch the Flint River, the compliance testing protocol yielded results of 
6 ppb in December 2014 and 1 1 ppb in June 2015. Both results were below the 
federal action level of 1 5 ppb. 

• However, we recognize some residents experience higher levels of lead in the 
water that comes out of their faucets because of lead plumbing in the home, and 
that’s a concern. 

• Out of an abundance of caution, we want to address the needs of all Flint 
families, and so we have developed an action plan that includes both short- and 
long-term solutions. 

• The state plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional 
precautions for families, and providing long-term solutions to address the city’s 
water infrastructure. 

Messaging regarding the action plan 

The city and the state are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that 
leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all 
residents. 

• Immediately test Flint public schools to ensure that drinking water is safe. 
Testing will also be available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

o Although Flint’s drinking water meets all federal requirements, the state 
wants to take extra steps to ensure that drinking water is safe for the city’s 
children. 

o The state will fund this testing (about $30,000) at no cost to the city or the 
local schools, and make the results publicly available. 

• Expand health exposure testing of individual residences. 

o To double-check its data as well as provide residents with an additional 
layer of assurance, the DEQ will conduct more tests at Flint properties. 

o The Technical Advisory Committee will determine the scope of this 
expanded testing. 

• Offer water testing at no cost to Flint residents to assure water is safe. 

o Although all testing indicates water in the city of Flint meets all federal 
standards, we understand some residents are concerned. 

o To ensure water in individual homes is safe, free water testing is available 
to all Flint residents. 

o We encourage anyone with a concern to get their water tested. 

o Contact the city water department to have your water tested. 

• Accelerate optimizing corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 




o A fully optimized corrosion control system can help coat the inside of pipes 
to minimize the amount of lead that enters the drinking water after it 
leaves the treatment plant. 

o This is a helpful step that can help minimize lead system-wide, and we’re 
pleased the city is moving to take this step. 

o If asked: This was not initially required because a fully optimized corrosion 
control system is not federally required in many water systems. Even 
today, since Flint is meeting all federal standards, this fully optimized 
system is not required. However, to address public concerns and ensure 
every possible precaution is taken, the city is moving forward with 
installing this corrosion control system. 

Expand the “Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee” to 
ensure the best technology, practices and science are being utilized, and 
add an expert from the EPA’s Office of Research and Development to the 
group. 

o The Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 7 to 
discuss fully optimizing the corrosion control system, expanding testing of 
at-risk properties, and other topics. 

o Tom Burke, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of 
Research and Development as well as the EPA’s Science Advisor, will 
participate on the committee. Prior to joining EPA, he held prominent 
positions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and 
founded the Johns Hopkins Risk Sciences and Public Policy Institute. He 
brings substantial expertise, and we’re pleased he is able join the 
committee. 

Accelerate water system improvements to address replacement of lead 
service lines. 

o Regardless of the drinking water source - whether it be DWSD, the Flint 
River or Lake Huron - the only permanent fix for lead is to replace all 
18,000 of the private lead service lines in the city. These are the lines on 
private property that lead from the curb to individual homes. 

o This is a problem in communities statewide, and one we want to address 
with a long-term solution. 

o The state and EPA are working together to find a way for the city to 
access Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds for the work. 

Expedite completion of Karegnondi Water Authority. 

o The move to the Flint River was always a temporary measure until the 
connection to the KWA and to Lake Huron was completed. 

o This is the ultimate goal of the venture, and the state and locals will work 
together to speed up completion of the connection. 

o 

Name Dr. Eden Wells as Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor. 

o Dr. Wells is the Director for the Preventive Medicine Residency at the 
University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor as well as the 
Chief Medical Executive for MDHHS. 



o 


She brings years of experience in epidemiology and preventative medicine 
to the issue, and we’re thrilled to have her expertise. 

o Dr. Wells will coordinate with Hurley Medical Center to share data on 
blood lead levels in children, as well as address other emerging issues. 

Provide water filters to residents of Flint. 

o As an additional precaution, water filters will be available to low-income 
families. 

o This provides another safeguard to ensure everyone in the city of Flint has 
access to clean drinking water that they feel confident drinking. 

Expand a comprehensive lead education initiative. 

o Lead plumbing is common in homes built prior to 1986, and anyone in the 
state with lead pipes in their home can take some extra precautions to 
minimize lead in their drinking water. 

o It takes time for lead to accumulate in drinking water from plumbing, and 
so flushing your pipes prior to using them can minimize your exposure. 

■ To flush your pipes, run the water until it’s as cold as it will go. This 
can take as little as 5 to 30 seconds if you have recently flushed the 
toilet or otherwise used water in your home, or as long as 2 to 5 
minutes if you have not used any water in hours. 

■ In the city of Flint, running the water for 5 minutes only costs about 
3-16 cents, depending on your faucet. 

o Additionally, more lead gets into hot water than cold water. Use only cold 
water for drinking, cooking and making baby formula.

Governor Snyder, 


The recent water concern in the City of Flint has revealed two actions for future drinking water 
shortages. 

In the past, the Flint area has used the National Guard water tanker for local road races. Also, daily 
water tankers fill our local swimming pools. 

When we have large numbers of citizens that must use the "Boil the Water" process, why can't we use 
the tankers I mentioned above? 

Flint has gone days without drinking water. 

With such a basic life need, let's try some possible solutions! We could dispense the water at Senior 
Centers, community gathering locations, neighborhood schools and churches. This could be seen as a 
training experience for the National Guard or Reserves. 

Governor, the need is there and the tankers are at hand. 

Thanks for your time and please let me know what you think. 

I hope this note finds you and your family in fine health. 



Genesee County Clerk 
John J. Gleason

GOVERNOR’S OFFICE BRIEFING PAPER 
CITY OF FLINT DRINKING WATER 


What contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the city of Flint? 

A number of factors, not one specific cause, likely contributed to the Boil Water 
Advisories (BWAs) in the city of Flint during August and September 2014. While use of 
the Flint River has increased the amount of natural organic matter in the city’s water, the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has performed well above treatment requirements 
for organic carbon removal. In addition, less than 20 percent of the water system was 
included in the advisory area. If treatment had been compromised, detections would 
have been widespread throughout the city, rather than in such a localized area. 

The city’s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment 
and asset management. Most of the city’s over 550 miles of water mains are now over 
75 years old and constructed of cast iron piping. Cast iron pipe is subject to internal 
corrosion, called tuberculation, which causes buildup on the pipe interior, leading to 
water quality issues, reduced flow and pressures, and leakage. Tuberculation also 
encourages the development of biofilms, layers of bacteria that attach to the interior 
pipe wall. Biofilm growth is common in areas of piping with little or no disinfectant 
residual, and together with tuberculation can clog water lines to the point of insufficient 
water pressure. 

The city has also experienced decades of a declining user base and water use 
associated with vacant homes, commercial businesses, and industrial property. 

Declining water use leads to excess residence time within the city’s distribution pipes 
and water storage facilities, accelerating tuberculation, biofilm growth, and disinfectant 
residual degradation. While the city has recently seen an infusion of funding for blight 
removal, contractors completing this work have been improperly using fire hydrants, 
causing hydraulic disturbances that dislodged and suspended settled debris, which may 
have contributed to the bacterial contamination. 

The winter of 2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water system. The 
city, which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 30 percent, has seen even 
greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold weather-related water 
main breaks and leaks. The city lacks a formal maintenance program for its over 7,250 
valves, which would normally be used to limit impacts during break repairs. Two valves 
on the transmission line used to supply the area of the BWAs were found to be closed 
during the city’s investigation, causing longer residence time, reduced disinfectant 
residual, reduced flow, and reduced pressure. One of these valves has remained 
broken.

The BWAs also occurred during the warmest and, for 2014, relatively wet periods of 
August and September. Warm weather conditions are not only more conducive to 
bacterial growth but also degrade the water’s disinfectant residual carried out from the 
WTP more quickly. Longer residence times, biofilms, and tuberculation also contribute 
to disinfectant residual degradation. Warm wet weather conditions also allow water 
contaminated with bacteria to pool around piping with leaks and breaks. 

Process for Issuance and Cancelation of a Boil Water Advisory 

There are a number of conditions that can trigger BWAs. This includes the following: 

- Bacteria Monitoring Detections - Loss of System Pressure 

- Bacteria Standards Violations - Water Main Breaks 

- Treatment System Failures - Other Interruptions in Service 

- Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has developed a policy and procedure 
regarding BWAs to help guide staff, provide consistency, and maintain public health. A 
PDF of Policy and Procedure No. ODWMA-399-022 is being forwarded with this briefing 
paper. 

BWAs may be self-initiated by the water system, issued collaboratively in consultation 
with the DEQ, or when necessary mandated by the DEQ. Requesting customers to boil 
the water when bacterial contamination has occurred provides an added barrier of 
public health protection. 

The BWAs that recently occurred in the city of Flint were associated with bacteria 
monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards. These advisories were 
issued by the city of Flint collaboratively in consultation with the DEQ. 

Current regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water distribution 
systems were developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have been in 
effect since 1990, and were incorporated into the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended. There are a variety of bacteria, parasites, and viruses that 
can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them in drinking water. Testing 
water for each of these potential pathogens would be difficult and expensive. Instead, 
water systems test for total coliform and E.coli. Total coliform bacteria react to water 
treatment in a manner similar to many pathogens. Therefore, the presence of total 
coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or other 
contaminants to enter the system. The absence of total conforms in the distribution 
system minimizes the likelihood that pathogens are present. E.coli is itself a pathogen, 
and its detection would be direct evidence of a health risk. 

Once a BWA has been issued, time is needed to investigate potential causes and 
implement corrective measures. The larger the water system, the more time this may 
take. Once corrective measures have been taken, samples must be collected and 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper 
City of Flint Drinking Water 
Page 3 


analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present. Using the most common 
analytical method, samples must be incubated for a period of 24 hours before results 
can be obtained. In situations where the bacterial contamination has been confirmed, 
two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 hours apart are normally 
obtained before canceling a BWA. Adding each of these steps together, a normal 
response period to cancel a BWA under these circumstances would be expected to take 
at least 3 to 4 days. 

Recent History of the City of Flint Water System 

Historically, the city of Flint had been a customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) while simultaneously maintaining the Flint WTP to provide 
emergency backup service using the Flint River. The WTP performed quarterly test 
operations to maintain readiness and was utilized twice in 2009, supplying water once 
for 2 days and the other for 3 days. 

In April 2013 the city of Flint notified the DWSD that it would be terminating service in 
the future and contracting for raw water service from the Karegnondi Water Authority 
(KWA). Work on the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron broke ground in June 2013 and is 
expected to be completed with connection in late 2016. 

In August 2013 Rowe Professional Services Company completed an engineering 
proposal for improvements to the Flint WTP that would allow continuous operation of 
the WTP utilizing the Flint River in lieu of continuing service from the DWSD until 
completion of the KWA pipeline. In March 2014 the city of Flint entered into a Consent 
Agreement with the DEQ regarding the Flint WTP’s lime sludge facility. In April 2014 
the DEQ issued a construction permit for improvements to the Flint WTP. On April 25, 
2014, the city of Flint began continuous operation of the WTP, using water from the Flint 
River and discontinued the purchase of water from the DWSD. 

A BWA was issued for August 1 5-20, 201 4, for a portion of the city of Flint due to 
localized detections of total coliform and E.coli bacteria. Another BWA was issued for 
September 5-9, 2014, due to localized detections of total coliform bacteria in the same 
and adjacent portions of the city of Flint. The advisory covered an area of 
approximately six square miles. The city of Flint has a total land area of just over 
34 square miles. 



Governor’s Office Briefing Paper

While many of the BWA contributing factors listed above require long-term solutions, the 
city has taken operational steps to limit the potential for a BWA to reoccur. The city has 
increased flushing of water mains to limit residence time, maintain disinfectant residual, 
and help remove buildup and deposits within the piping. The city is boosting chlorine 
disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed. The city 
continues to investigate water leaks and water main breaks and the status and condition 
of system valves.

A Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Policy and Procedure cannot establish regulatory 
requirements for parties outside of the DEQ. This document provides direction to DEQ staff 
regarding the implementation of rules and laws administered by the DEQ. It is merely 
explanatory; does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public; 
and does not have the force and effect of law. 


INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, OR ISSUE: 

Community water systems are expected to provide customers with a continuous supply of water 
that meets both federal and state drinking water standards. However, there may be 
circumstances when the public must be notified that the water may not be safe. In these 
circumstances, a boil water advisory may be issued to prevent illness from known or suspected 
microbiological contamination. This policy is to provide guidance to Office of Drinking Water 
and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) drinking water program staff on advising community water 
system personnel when to issue and rescind a boil water advisory, the appropriate content, and 
the manner and method of delivery. 

AUTHORITY: 

Administrative rule R 325.10401a promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 

1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399), being Michigan Compiled Law 325.1001 et seq., requires 
public notification for violations of maximum contaminant levels and treatment techniques plus 
other situations as determined by the DEQ. Each public notice is required to state what actions 
consumers should take during a violation, which may include a statement recommending water 
customers boil all water used for consumption until further notice. 

In addition, R 325.1 1207 allows the DEQ to require the supplier of water to provide notice to 
customers or users that include any precautionary measures deemed necessary when an 
interruption in water service occurs, which could include low, zero, or negative pressure events. 

Furthermore, R 325. 1 2303 requires a supplier of water to include in their contingency planning a 
description of precautions or measures to be taken to protect the health of those customers or 
users that may be affected by an emergency. R 325.12304 also requires a supplier of water to 
notify the DEQ when an emergency is discovered and how the supply will notify its customers or 
users. While the content of this notification to customers or users may vary depending upon 
individual circumstances, each notification to customers or users must state what actions or 
precautions they should take, which may include a statement to boil ail water used for 
consumption until further notice.

STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT: 

DEQ staff met with Municipal Utilities Directors to seek input on issues that were subsequently 
addressed in this policy and procedure. 

DEFINITIONS: 

“Boil Water Advisory (BWA)” - A written or verbal advisory issued by the community water 
system or DEQ notifying the users of the water system that the water is or may be contaminated 
and advising them to boil the water prior to using it for drinking or cooking. 

“Community Water Supply (CWS)" - A public water supply (PWS) that provides year-round 
service to not fewer than 15 living units, or that regularly provides year-round service to not 
fewer than 25 residents. Examples include municipalities, such as cities, villages, and 
townships; apartment complexes; manufactured housing communities; condominiums; and 
nursing homes. 

“Complete Loss of Pressure” - Sustained negative pressures or pressure below five psi in any 
portion of a distribution system. It does not include instantaneous low or negative pressure 
occurring from pressure surges caused by pump cycling, valve operation, or other water 
hammer events, 

“Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)” - The maximum permissible level of a contaminant in 
water that is delivered to any user of a PWS. 

"Repeat Sample” - A sample that is collected and analyzed in response to a previous coliform- 
positive sample. 

“Routine Sample” - A water sample that is collected and analyzed to meet the monitoring 
requirements for total coliform, as outlined in the written sampling plan. 

"Tier 1 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 24 hours after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has significant potential to 
have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure. A Tier 1 
Public Notice also requires the supplier to initiate consultation with the DEQ as soon as practical 
but not later than 24 hours after the supplier learns of the violation or situation. Examples of 
these violations or situations include: 

1 . A violation of the Total Coliform MCL when fecal or E.coli are present in the distribution 
system; 

2. A violation of the treatment technique requirement resulting from a single exceedance of 
the maximum allowable turbidity limit; 

3. An occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak; 

4. A failure or significant interruption in key water treatment processes; 

5. A disruption of the water supply or distribution system; and

6. Other violations or situations as determined by the DEQ on a case-by-case basis. A 

violation or situation that requires a Tier 1 Public Notice also requires the supplier to consult 
with the DEQ to determine additional public notice requirements, including the timing, form, 
manner, frequency and content of the notice designed to reach all persons served, and any 
repeat notices or directions. At a minimum, one or more of the following forms of delivery 
must be used: 

a. Appropriate broadcast media: 

b. Posting of the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the area served by the system; 

c. Hand delivery of the notice to persons served by the system; or 

d. Another delivery method approved by the DEQ. 

Within 10 days of completing the Tier 1 Public Notice, the supplier shall submit to the DEQ a 
certification that it fully complied with the public notification requirements, including a 
representative copy of the type of notice distributed to persons served by the system and to the 
media. 

“Tier 2 Public Notice” - A public notice required to be provided as soon as practical but not later 
than 30 days after the supplier learns of a violation or situation that has the potential to have 
serious adverse effects on human health. Examples of these violations or situations include: 

1 . All violations of MCL, maximum residual disinfectant level, and treatment technique 
requirements except where the DEQ determines a Tier 1 notice is required. 

2. Violations of monitoring and testing procedure requirements, taking into account potential 
health impacts and persistence of the violation; and 

3. Failure to comply with a variance or exemption. 

For a Tier 2 Public Notice, the DEQ may, on a case-by-case basis, grant extensions in writing 
for up to three months from the date the supplier learns of the violation or situation, for reasons 
such as coordinating with billing cycles or if the violation or situation was quickly resolved and 
no longer poses any risk to the persons served. A Tier 2 Public Notice shall be repeated every 
three months as long as the violation or situation exists. A Tier 2 Public Notice and any repeat 
notices shall be in a form and issued in a manner that is reasonably calculated to reach persons 
served in the required time period. At a minimum, the notice shali be provided: 

1 . By mail or direct delivery to each customer receiving a bill and to other service connections 
to which water is delivered by the supplier, and 

2. By other methods reasonably calculated to reach other persons not receiving a bill, such as 
apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients and prison inmates. Other 
methods may include: 

a. Publication in a local newspaper 

b. Delivery of multiple copies to apartment complexes and manufactured housing 
communities 

c. Posting in public places or on the Internet 

d. Delivery to community organizations

“Treatment Technique (TT)” - Minimum treatment requirement or a necessary methodology or 
technology that is employed by a supplier of water for the control of the chemical, physical, 
biological, or radiological characteristics of a PWS. 

POLICY: 

A 8WA may be issued for a variety of reasons when microbial contamination is known or 
suspected. Total Coliform Rule (TCR) MCL violations, surface water TT violations, low or loss 
of pressure events, and waterborne disease outbreaks are circumstances when a BWA may be 
issued. Each of these situations is discussed in detail below. However, these situations are not 
the only times a BWA can or should be issued, Each incident must be handled on a case-by- 
case basis, using professional judgment to evaluate the circumstances in each situation. 

Finally, there may be situations when water systems experience contamination that is not 
microbial, but chemical due to a chemical spill or backflow due to a cross connection. In these 
cases, a notice to customers could include “Do Not Use” language since boiling the water may 
not remove the contamination. 

Types of Incidents: 

1 . Violation of a Drinking Water Standard 
a. TCR MCL Violations 

An acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of coliform 
organisms in both a routine and a follow-up repeat sample in the same monitoring 
period, and either analysis (routine or repeat) is also positive for fecal or E.coli. Because 
this MCL violation confirms the presence of a more direct connection to contamination, 
these violations warrant issuance of a BWA, unless there are unique circumstances. 

A non-acute TCR MCL violation occurs when monitoring indicates the presence of 
coliform bacteria in 2 or more samples in the same monitoring period for a supplier 
collecting less than 40 samples per month, or in more than 5 percent of the samples for 
a supplier collecting 40 or more samples per month, and the criteria for an acute 
violation did not occur, i.e., fecal coliform or E.coli were NOT detected present in either a 
routine or repeat sample. For example, a system that collects 5 samples per week for a 
total of 20 per month may have 1 sample report positive for total coliform or fecal I E.coli 
during the first week, but all repeat samples report negative for coliform. If another 
sample in a subsequent week also reports total or fecal/E.coli positive, but again, all 
repeat samples are coliform-negative, then a non-acute TCR MCL violation has occurred 
because 2 or more samples reported positive for coliform, but no fecai coliform or E.coli 
were detected in both a routine and a repeat sample.

When a non-acute violation occurs, staff should evaluate possible sources of 
contamination. If a source is identified that is considered likely to contribute disease 
causing organisms or result in water of questionable quality still being distributed, a BWA 
should be instituted. Examples of contaminant sources that would elevate the public 
health risk include, but are not limited to: 

• flooding of the wells 

• failure of the treatment system 

• recent construction activity in the distribution system 

• vermin (birds, rodents, etc.) activity in storage tanks 

• system-wide or extensive pressure loss in the distribution system 

Even if the source of contamination is not easily identified, a BWA may be appropriate 
for a non-acute TCR violation if the violation is widespread or ongoing. A BWA shall be 
instituted if monitoring indicates E. coli or fecal coliform contamination unless unusual 
circumstances warrant consideration, such as the absence of any coliform in repeat 
samples, or when staff are assured that the contamination has been eliminated before 
confirmation results are available. 

However, not every TCR MCL violation must result in a BWA, There may be a few 
exceptions when there is a TCR MCL violation but a BWA is not needed. For example, 
a violation may be declared in situations where samples collected on different days from 
widely dispersed locations report coliform present even though repeat samples do not 
show positive results. In this case, the sampling results may constitute a MCL violation, 
but a BWA may not be necessary. 

If a BWA is deemed necessary by the ODWMA, it should be issued as soon as possible 
but no later than 24 hours after the system learns of the violation. Because violation of 
an MCL results in required public notification (PN) per the PN Rule, the water supply 
may issue the PN and BWA simultaneously in one document (highly recommended) and 
must meet all the requirements of a Tier 1 PN and include BWA language. 

After measures have been taken to eliminate the source(s) of contamination, such as 
initiating or increasing chlorine feed rates and system flushing, additional sampling must 
be conducted. Raw water bacteriological sampling is also encouraged to eliminate the 
raw water as the possible source of contamination. For MCL violations, the BWA can be 
rescinded after the analyses of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the 
absence of coliform bacteria. The number of samples in each set should be a minimum 
of five samples, but can be decreased or increased based on system size or the extent 
of the affected area. Systems are encouraged to use routine sample sites if available 
and to use extra care if routine sites are not available.

b. Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) TT Violations 
SWTR TT violations include: 

• exceedance of turbidity standards at filter confluence point 

• failure to meet disinfection contact time requirements (C*T) 

• failure to meet disinfection residual standards 

Upon determination of an SWTR TT violation, ODWMA staff must determine if the 
violation poses a threat to public health. For example, if the turbidity levels at the filter 
confluence point were found to have exceeded 0.3 nephlometric turbidity units (NTUs) in 
95 percent of the samples in a two-month period, an SWTR TT violation has occurred. 
Based upon a review of plant performance and consultation with program managers, 
staff may determine that no significant health risk was posed and no BWA is necessary. 
However, the water supply must still issue a Tier 2 PN within 30 days of the violation. 

On the other hand, a BWA is likely to be necessary for a treatment plant that gets 
overwhelmed by excessive runoff and reports a turbidity level in excess of 1,0 NTU at 
the filter confluence point for a four-hour period. 

If the TT violation is ongoing or prolonged, or the ODWMA determines a significant 
public health risk is posed, ODWMA staff may elevate the PN to Tier 1 status, which 
must be issued within 24 hours and include BWA language. After appropriate measures 
have been taken to reduce or eliminate any health risk, additional monitoring must be 
conducted. Appropriate measures may include increasing coagulant dose, increasing 
chlorine residuals through the treatment plant, backwashing filters more often and 
flushing key system components. In this case, a BWA can be rescinded after analyses 
of two sets of samples collected 24 hours apart report the absence of coliform bacteria. 
The number of samples in each set should be a minimum of five samples, but can be 
decreased or increased based on type and severity of the TT violation. 

Surface water plants utilizing conventional or direct filtration must add a primary 
coagulant under R 325.1 1008. Failure to add a primary coagulant is a violation of 
Act 399, and may also contribute to a TT violation under R 325.1061 1 (Filtration and 
Disinfection) which requires 3-log inactivation of giardia and 4-log inactivation of viruses. 
In these cases, ODWMA staff will have to determine if the violation poses a threat to 
public health and whether other actions are necessary, such as requiring a BWA. 

Factors to consider if a BWA is necessary would include chlorine residual concentrations 
throughout the treatment plant, raw water quality, C*T compliance, plus individual filter 
effluent and combined filter effluent turbidity levels. 

2. Waterborne Disease Outbreaks 

Waterborne disease outbreaks can be declared by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Department of Community Health, a local health department, or other public

Number: ODWMA-399-022 

Subject: Guidelines for Issuing Boil Water Advisories to

health institutions. If an outbreak is declared, the ODWMA will work with the declaring 
agency to ensure affected community public water supplies take appropriate measures to 
mitigate public exposure. These measures will include appropriate public notification, 
including instructions to boil water if appropriate. The ODWMA will allow the water supply to 
rescind the notification when the agency declaring the outbreak indicates it is safe to do so 
as the result of additional monitoring. 

3. Interruptions in Service 

a. Negative or Complete Loss of Pressure 

A complete loss of pressure or negative pressure in the distribution system must result in 
a BWA being issued to all water customers in the impacted area. After pressure is 
restored and the system recovers (tanks are filling and enough sources are operating to 
ensure pressures do not drop again), the affected area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples must be taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution 
system remains free of coliform contamination. The number of samples will vary 
depending on the size of the system and the extent of the area impacted. For very small 
systems that experience a power failure that results in a complete loss of pressure 
throughout the distribution system, a minimum of three samples should be collected. If 
applicable, chlorine residual measurements should be taken to ensure that an adequate 
disinfectant residual is present. If possible, chlorine dosages and residuals should be 
increased by 1 to 2 parts per million during this period as a corrective and preventive 
measure. If the first round of sampling does not detect coliform bacteria, the advisory 
may be rescinded. However, if the first round of sampling detects coliform bacteria, 
additional flushing should be conducted in the area where the positive coliform samples 
were collected and a second round of coliform samples collected from the area. The 
BWA should remain in effect until safe coliform sample results are obtained. 

b. Low Pressure Events 

Low pressure events might not result in a BWA. Low pressure is considered a drop in 
pressure below 20 psi but greater than 5 psi. A drop in water pressure in a distribution 
system could allow contamination to enter the water system through backflow by 
backpressure or backsiphonage. The decision to issue a BWA should be made on a 
case-by-case basis and be based upon professional judgment of all available data that 
may indicate the extent of the problem, such as: 

• Geographical extent of the pressure loss 

• Nature of the service area (residential vs. commercial/industriai) 

• Duration of the low pressure condition 

• Disinfection practices of the water system 

• Relative elevation differences in the service area 

• Status of the local cross connection control program

• Age and condition of the underground piping 

• Amount of underground piping located in areas of a high groundwater table 

• Ability and willingness of the operators to rapidly apply chlorine to the system or 
distribute an increased chlorine residual throughout the affected area 

After normal pressure is restored, the impacted area should be thoroughly flushed and 
coliform samples taken throughout the area to determine if the distribution system is free 
of any bacteriological contamination. The collection of coliform samples after low 
pressure events is not absolutely required, but may be recommended based on the 
factors above. 

c. Water Main Breaks or Repairs 

A BWA may be issued during water main breaks and after the break has been repaired. 
Whether or not to issue a BWA will depend on the location and severity of the break and, 
more importantly, a decision based on sound engineering judgment that the integrity of 
the water system has been maintained. If at all possible, repairs should be performed 
under reduced or low pressure by closing the closest valves on each side of the break 
just enough to reduce the flow so the repairs can be made under pressure while the 
water flowing from the break is diverted away from the excavation to maintain clean 
sanitary conditions. If the water main can be repaired under pressure, and no 
nonpotable water, soil, or other potential contaminants entered the main during the 
break and repair process, then a BWA is not necessary. If the water main that was 
removed from service is flushed, disinfected, and sampled in accordance with AWWA 
Standard C651 before being placed back into service, a BWA does not need to be 
issued. 

If a water main break results in a complete loss of pressure before, during, or after the 
repair is made, a BWA must be issued to al! customers in the affected area. The BWA 
should remain in effect until the area is flushed, chlorine residuals are reestablished (if 
applicable), and sample results do not detect coliform bacteria. 

Content and Delivery of a BWA 


If the ODWMA determines a BWA is necessary, the water supply must issue the advisory as 
soon as practical, but not later than 24 hours after being advised to do so. The supply must 
make a good faith attempt to notify all customers in the affected area. Appropriate methods of 
distribution are situation specific, but may include radio or television broadcasts, hand delivery, 
and/or posting in conspicuous locations throughout the area. Delivery requirements as detailed 
in the PN Rule should be used to determine appropriate delivery methods. 

Although there are content requirements for public notification under the PN Rule, there are no 
requirements specific to boil water language. To ensure all appropriate information is 
transmitted to the customers, a BWA should include the same content elements as required for

POLICY AND PROCEDURE 


Number: ODWMA-399-022 

Subject: Guidelines for Issuing Boil Water Advisories to

public notification under the PN Rule. If a BWA is issued as the result of an MCL violation and 
the water supply issues the BWA in conjunction with the required PN (highly recommended), the 
content MUST meet all PN Rule content, delivery, and reporting requirements. 

The ODWMA boil water language is consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
policy that requires water be brought to a boil and allowed to boil for one minute before use. 

The language also suggests the use of bottled water as an alternative to boiling and describes 
the circumstances under which boiled or bottled water should be used. 

Staff should notify the appropriate local health department and the Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development, Food and Dairy Division, whenever a BWA is issued or rescinded. 
These agencies may receive calls from concerned customers or be involved in oversight of 
facilities impacted by the boil advisory and, therefore, need to be aware of the situation. 

Several BWA templates have been created and are available to ODWMA staff on the DEQ 
Intranet. To ensure consistency and inclusion of ail necessary content, these templates should 
be used as the basis for PNs and/or a BWA. Available templates include, but are not limited to: 

• Advisory for a TCR MCL. 

• Advisory for a low/no pressure event. 

• Notification for cancellation of a BWA. 

PROCEDURES: 

WHO I DOES WHAT 

Public Water Supply Notify DEQ of results in a timely manner as required by law and follow 

through with appropriate actions. 

District Staff Respond to all TCR and TT violations plus complete loss of pressure 

events in a timely manner and determine whether a BWA needs to be 
issued. 

• If needed, assist supply in drafting BWA and determining most 
appropriate method of delivery with approval from the District 
Supervisor. 

• If needed, assist the supply in determining actions to remove 
the possible contamination including steps needed to rescind 

the BWA. 

District Staff Provide on-site technical assistance for acute TCR MCL violations 

and other boil water situations as appropriate. 

District Supervisors Assist District Staff in the all matters pertaining to issuing a BWA.

Flint Meeting 


FYI - Laurie added Dave to the internal Flint Meeting in the morning. But she just said that Dick told her to 
downsize the afternoon meeting because it’s too large. So she’s taking Harvey and Dave off and the mayor 
but Ambrose is included. I’m not sure who all of the original people are but that’s who’s being included in the 
afternoon one.

availability for a call today anytime between 2pm and 5pm and she will send out the appointment and 
conference line information. I’ll loop in Gerry Ambrose once we reach consensus. 

Best, 

Harvey

I don’t think Dennis can go to Flint without having to completely reschedule a day and he is out of the office August 10 
and then August 1 2 - 25 so I really can’t completely redo a day. There's no place to put things

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council March 25, may have set in motion the end to 

Flint paying to get its water from Detroit 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for 
treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the 
Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department Of Environmental Quality must approve Flint's getting 2 million gallons per 
day from the Flint River. 


Tuesday's meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 
“We got there," Councilman Joshua Freeman said, "That's the important thing.” 


There were more than 50 people at Monday's meeting. 

"Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion art: the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca 
Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition eyecdti ^liililllil "If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at 
risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs." 



Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste 
advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Hint has an emergency financial manager. 
All expenditures oyer £50,000 must be approved. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water 
service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save million overelgHt^ieirs by getting water from the Kwa, 

’Tt's a historic djght in the City of less with the capacity level approved by city 

council because there will be increased treatment cost for toe 111111111111 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work 
done at Flint's water plant. 

Flint's water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only 
operates four times per year. 

Councilman Bryant Holden was the lone dissenting vote* 

"It was a protest vote," Holden said. "I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 


Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint 
and Lapeer.

GENESEE COUNTY, MI — The state has approved a critical permit that allows the Karegiiondi 
Water Authority to tap into Lake Huron with a 1.5-mile underground intake. 


But water authority officials are still waiting for Flint to decide if it will he part of it. 


ConslTueiion on the Intake — estimated to cost $27 million — might mark the no-tuming-back 
point for the massive project, and county Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said other developments 
make it necessary Flint to make a final decision on its involvement in the next few months. 


As control of Flint has shifted from mayors and city councils to emergency managers, the city has 
never committed to buying a minimum volume of water from the KWA. 

"The only question at this point really is whether Flint is going to be a partner," said Wright, who has 
met with emergency financial manager Ed Kurtz and wants to resolve the question before Kurtz 
leaves his position — something likely to happen soon after the November election. 

"I'd say we have a couple of months here," Wright said of Flint's deadline. He described Kurtz as 
positive about the city's potential involvement but said, "There's still some questions Flint is working 
on with Detroit and Lansing.” 


Kurtz said he can't predict what will happen. 


"We're looking at all our options," Kurtz said Friday. 

County Commissioner Ted Henry, D-Clayton Twp., said regardless of the city's participation, the 
pipeline can be built by the remaining partners: Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties and the city of 
Lapeer, 

"The answer is yes," Henry said. "It will be a little different but it can go,"

The drain commissioner said construction of the pipeline intake, which has already been designed, is 
expected to start this year, after the job is put out for bids and borrowing is authorized by the county 
Board of Commissioners, 

Building the intake will be specialized work, part of which must be done from a barge, and will require 
building tunnels below the sand bo ttom of the lake and laying an 8 4 -inch pipe below the surface of 
the water. 

In addition to the state Department of Environmental Quality permit to build the intake, the KWA 
also needs approval from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Wright said. 


A. 45-day public comment period on the intake permit has passed and county officials said they expect 
the permit to be approved within two weeks. 

Among other recent developments in the pipeline project: 

® The Genesee County Water and Waste Advisory Committee, made up of elected and appointed 
city, township and village officials, has voted unanimously to set a date for accepting public 
bids to build the intake. 

* Tire same committee has approved negotiating a contract with Wade Trim to act as program 
manager for the pipeline project once all necessary permits have been received. 

® The county has revised its estimate on the cost of the intake portion of the pipeline from $40 
million to $27 million. 


Wright said his office is ready to negotiate a contract for Wade Trim to oversee the pipeline work, and 
said he expects six or seven engineering and surveying companies to assist in getting the job done. 


County officials count those jobs among the 1,000 that they say will he created by building the 
pipeline. 

"1 want to use local (people) wherever possible and keep the money here," Wright said. 

The drain commissioner said the selection of Wade Trim is important to the city of Flint because it 
signals the start of" engineering, which includes decisions about the size of pumps, motors and pipes 
that will be used to build the pipeline. 

Flint officials have options, including the use of Flint River water, or continuing to purchase wafer 
from the city of Detroit, 


5 



Wright said the only choice for the rest of the county is build the pipeline or sign a 30-year contract 
with Detroit. 


A KWA study claims that continuing to buy water from Detroit will cost the region $2.1 billion during 
the next 25 years. By building a pipeline, that cost would be $1.9 billion over the same period, the 
KWA Web site says. 


After the initial 25-year period, the cost of water would be less than 25 percent of the projected cost of 
water form Detroit, according to KWA.

COMMENTARY: MDEQ Mistakes and 


Deception Created the 


*~'int Wateii Crisis 


September 30, 201 5 Articles 



As results of our collaborative research with Flint 
re sidents exposed widespread problems with elevated levels of 
lead in Flint’s water, the Michigan Department ofEnvironmenta f 
iQualif^ (MDEQ) repeatedly attempted to discredit our findings 
and downplay the public health threat. For example, MDEQ’s 
Communications Director Brad Wurfel wrote to The Flint 
Journal’s Ronald Fonger: 


“...the state DEQ is just as perplexed by Edwards* 
results as he seems to he hy the City’s test results . 
When I said we were unsure how the Virginia Tech 


surprised that they got them. ... this group specializes 


surprised when the rabbit conies out of the hat , even if 
they can’t figure out how it is done..... while the state 


some quick testing could be seen as fanning political 
flames irresponsibly . Residents of Flint concerned 
about the health of their community don’t need more of 
that . ” 


Now that Dr. Mona Hanna- Attisha and Hurley Medical Center 
researchers have revealed that the rising leve l s of lead in Hint 
iw&te fi have been associated with increased blood lead of Flint’s 


children , our early health advice has been vindicated by most 
accounts. But MDEQ still dismisses the water controversy as 
“near~hvsteria,” and characterizes the Hurley study conclusions 
as “ unfortunate n if not quite “irresponsible. ” 


Given MDEQ’s insistence that there is absolutely nothing wrong 
with Bill wateij, we have created a timeline that illustrates how 
MDEQ’s mistakes and deception created the Biilt Waterj Crisis in 
the first place. Our analysis relies on e-mails and documents 
obtained through Freedom of Information Act (EOIA) requests 
by the American Civil Liberties Union-Michigan (ACLUl of 
Michigan) and FlintWaterStudy.org. 


All |J|Jf| documents are provided at the end of this article for 
review. 


Phase 1. MDEQ Fails to Require Corrosion Control 
for Flint River Water (April 2014) 

Effective July 1998, the federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) has 
required that all large public water systems maintain a program 
to control levels of lead in drinking water from corrosion. 
Moreover, the law also requires the City of Flint to have a state 
approved plan, with enforceable regulatory limits for “Water 
Quality Parameters” including pH, alkalinity and/or corrosion 
inhibitor dose measured in the water distribution system. 

MDEQ never required Flint to have a corrosion control program, 
nor did it set water quality parameters for the new Flint River 
source water. While M D EQ asserts that they are acting 
proactively to get a corrosion control program in Flint, there is 


no provision in the LCR that allows for corrosion control to ever 
be interrupted. 

As a direct result of this mistake, Flint residents have been 
completely unprotected from elevated lead in water from the 
moment the switch to Flint River water was made. This has 
created a conflict of interest for MDEQ ever since. Specifically, 
MDEQ’s failure to require a corrosion control program is what 
created the Flint water crisis in the first place-they now have a 
vested interest in covering up the problem. 

Phase 2. MDEQ misinforms the USEPA about 
Flint’s Corrosion Control (February-March 2015) 

Even if we assume MDEQ was confused about its obligations 
under the LCR, when problems with high lead started to crop up 
in February 2015, they should have quickly acted to correct the 
mistake. Samples with high lead were reported at t h e University 
of M ichigan-Flint Campus , and on February 26, 2015 Mike 
Glasgow (City of Flint) did excellent detective work discovering 
high lead (over too ppb) in water samples from Flint resident 
Lee-Anne Walters’ home. 

Ms. Walters immediately forwarded her results to 
representatives of USEPA Region 5, who in turn immediately 
forwarded the results to Stephen Busch and Mike Prysby 
(MDEQ) with the subject line “HIGH LEAD 2 ElJlSIl 
Water* testing Results” The EPA e-mail correctly informed 
MDEQ that Ms. Walters’ high lead was likely due to "... the 
different chemistry water. ..leaching out contaminants 
from the insides of... the pipes UT>ut MDEQ denied to EPA 
that that Flint had a lead in water problem. 



At that point, EPA Region 5 lead-in-water expert Miguel Del 
Toral asked MDEQ a question through another EPA employee: 

" 'Miguel was wondering if Flint is feeding Phosphates. 
Flint must have Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment- 
is it Phosphates ?" 


On February 27 th , 2015, MDEQ’s Stephen Busch unequivocally 
and falsely responded to EPA that: 

“The City of Flint. ..Has an Optimized Corrosion 
Control Program <and> Conducts quarterly Water 
Quality Parameter monitoring at 25 sites and has not 
had any unusual results. ” 

Reassured by MDEQ’s false statement, Del Toral ended USEPA’s 
February conversation with MDEQ by stating: 

“If I remember correctly , Detroit is feeding P04for the 
LCR , but since Flint is no longer part of that 
interconnection , I was wondering what their <Optimal 
Corrosion Control> was . They are required to have 
<Optimal Corrosion Control> in place which is why I 
ivas asking what they were using.” 

On March 18, 2015, Lee-Anne Walters’ home was retested after 
flushing her system thoroughly. This time the test result came 
back even worse with 397 ppb lead- almost 40 times higher than 
the World Health Organization 10 ppb safety threshold. EPA 
Region 5 forwarded the results to MDEQ, with a query “Any 
thoughts on how to respond to her? Pm running out of 



MDEQ’s response, delivered in a voicemail to Del Toral on 
March 19, 2015, stated that MDEQ had investigated and 
found Ms . Walters’ high lead was due to lead sources 
in her plumbing. On March 27, 2015, Walters' son, who had 
been having health problems, was tested for lead in his blood. 
The blood lead results came back high- well over the 5 ug/dL 
CDC threshold of concern. 

Phase 3. Walters and Del Toral Investigate the 
Veracity of MDEQ Statements (April to June 2015) 

With good reason, Lee-Anne Walters did not accept the MDEQ’s 
explanation to Del Toral for the high lead in her water. The 
internal plumbing had been stolen from the house before it was 
purchased, and they had installed new (lead free) plastic 
plumbing before moving in. 

Walters also checked up on the MDEQ statement that Flint had 
“an Optimized Corrosion Control Program." She called the City 
of Flint, and city officials correctly informed her that there was 
no program at all. 

Walters then passed this alarming information along to EPA’s 
Del Toral, who on April 23^ e-mailed MDEQ, and again asked 
what corrosion control program Flint was using. It was only then 
that MDEQ finally acknowledged that there was NO program. 
Concerned due to the very high occurrence of lead service lines 
(LSLs) in Flint, on April 27 th Del Toral wrote an EPA Region 5 
internal e-mail stating: 


“ Flint has not been operating any corrosion control 
treatment , which is very concerning given the 
likelihood ofLSLs in the City.” 


That night Del Toral also stopped at Walters’ house on a trip 
north, and personally inspected her plumbing first hand. He 
confirmed it was plastic and lead-free. Del Toral also dropped off 
sample bottles at the Walters’ home, and told her that if she 
wanted an analysis to contact Professor Marc Edwards (the 
author of this article and Principal Investigator of 
FlintWaterStudy.org) at Virginia Tech. 

The next morning Edwards talked Walters through an intensive 
30 bottle sampling protocol. When the bottles were returned to 
Virginia Tech and analyzed, Edwards and his senior research 
scientist Dr. Jeff Parks were stunned by the results . The average 
lead in was 2,429 ppb lead, the high was 13,200 ppb, and even 
after 25 minutes flushing the water never dropped below 200 
ppb. After Walters told Del Toral about the high lead results, he 
drove back to Flint, just in time to observe the City replacing the 
service line to Walters’ home. He personally collected a sample of 
the pipe and verified it to be pure lead. 

In a follow-up memo da t ed June 24. 2015 , which was sent to 
both Walters and Edwards, Del Toral outlined numerous 
concerns about the situation regarding the serious lead corrosion 
problem in Flint. He included a clear recommendation that the 
USEPA investigate whether the City of Flint was in compliance 
with federal laws for lead corrosion control. 


Phase 4. MDEQ “Handles” the LCR Report, ACLU|- 
Michigan, Virginia Tech and Miguel Del Toral (July 
to August 2015) 

> “Revising” the Original LCR Repor t, In spite of all the 
problems documented with lead in Flint flfiteij from February to 
June 2015, Flint and MDEQ took a lackadaisical approach to the 
federally required LCR sampling program. Specifically, just 5 
days before the June 30 th deadline to collect the 100 samples that 
MDEQ required, the City had only collected 39 samples. 

Adam Rosenthal (MDEQ) e-mailed Mike Glasgow at the City of 
Flint: 

“We hope you have 61 more lead/copper samples 
collected and sent to the lab by 6/30/15 , and that they 
will be below the AL for lead , As ofnoiu with 39 results , 
Flint's go* 11 percentile is over the AL for lead.” 

In the next five days the City collected 30 samples, all of which 
were below the action level, and did not reach the 100 sample 
target. If all 71 submitted samples had been considered valid, the 
City would have exceeded the 15 ppb action level. Federal law 
would then require that Flint residents be provided information 
about how to protect themselves and their children from lead in 
water. MDEQ’s failure to install corrosion control would have 
been flagged as an obvious mistake. But none of that happened. 

Instead, the MDEQ “revised” the City's original LCR report, 
invalidating two high lead results, so that the 90%’ile was under 
the 15 ppb action level. The validity of samples showing low lead 
in the City’s sampling was never questioned. This is a problem, 


because the City has now admitted that they do not know which 
homes had lead pip e, even though it is stated in writing in the 
report that all sampled homes had lead pipe. By law, at least 50 
percent of the homes sampled must be verified to have lead pipe, 
and the remainder of homes sampled must have been built 
before 1986 and known to have lead solder. There is no basis for 
believing that this requirement was met in either the 2014 or 
2015 LCR sampling events conducted by the City. Hence, the City 
of Flint has not had a valid LCR sampling event since the switch 
to Flint River water. 

MDEQ then lowered the minimum number of required samples 
from 100 to 60, making it look like the City of Flint had met the 
target. MDEQ also did not question the City’s open 
acknowledgement that homes from 2014 had not been re- 
sampled, or that high risk (Tier 1) sites were not used. 

The original report , due July 10 th , was also late by several weeks. 
All of these violations of federal law were glossed over, to make it 
appear that the City had passed its lead testing with flying colors. 
Just like that, according to MDEQ at least, the City of Flint had 
no LCR violations at all. 

> jli M |-Michigan [Bi ll . The timing by which the “revised” 
LCR report was created, is also of interest. On July 22, 2015, 
the ^p@i-Michigan submitted a FOlAj to MDEQ, requesting the 
City of Flint’s LCR report supposedly due on July 10, 2015. The 
City’s original LCR report with all the obvious problems is dated 
July 28, 2015. MDEQ never provided the ^C SB-Michigan with 
the original LCR report. Instead, they created the scrubbed 
revised report, on August 20, 2015, and sent that report to 
ALCU-Michigan (from the City of Flint) the next day. In the 




comments section of the report, Flint openly states “ Revised 
report after conference call with DEQ staff. Two 
samples ivcrc removed from list for not meeting 


samples was reduced to 60/’ 


> MDEQ to FlintWaterStudy.org What 

conference call? On September 9, 2015, Virginia Tech 
submitted a FOIA| to MDEQ explicitly requesting records and 
minutes of the conference call between DEQ staff and Flint cited 
in the revised LCR report. This PiM request has been denied by 
MDEQ, because " Your request does not include the 
date/ time of the conference call and who from the 


the conference call. ” FlintWaterStudy.org immediately 
appealed the withholding of documents related to the conference 
call to the State of Michigan. On September 28 th , our appeal was 
denied. We may commence a civil action if we do not agree with 
the decision. 


> Handling Miguel Del Toral. MDEQ obviously had a major 
problem on its hands with EPA’s lead-in-water expert Miguel Del 
Toral. On August 4 th 2015, Lee- Anne Walters and Melissa Mays 
met with MDEQ officials to discuss Flint’s lead in water 
problems. The MDEQ officials participating in the meeting were 
identified by Mays and Walters, as Liane Shekter-Smith (Chief of 
the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance), Stephen 
Busch and Brad Wurfel. 


According to Walters and Mays, Shekter-Smith bragged 
that “Mr. Del Toral has been handled/’ and that Flint 
residents would not be hearing from him again. Moreover, 


MDEQ asserted that Mr. Del Torahs interim memo detailing the 
many problems with Flint’s (non-existent) corrosion control 
program “ would never be finalized, ” Just yesterday, NPR 
released a slightly different , but enlightening version of Wurfel’s 
take on Del Toral and the memo: 

MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel says the report mas the 
work of a “rogue employee,” and promised the final 
report — not yet released — would tell a much different 
story . 


Mays and Walters vividly recall Wurfel, smirking or laughing, 
whenever they expressed concern about elevated lead in Flint’s 
water. Looking back on the exchange yesterday, Mays stated “It 


Flint’s children . 99 

Angered, Lee-Anne Walters then called Edwards, and informed 
him that Del Toral would no longer be working on pHIl 
i(aW issues, and the two discussed the clear implication that 
EPA bureaucrats had intervened to prevent Del Toral from 
further exposing MDEQ’s numerous blunders and the health 
threat to Flint residents. She further stated that “It is too late 
for my son , but I will not stand by and let this happen 
to another other innocent child in Flint.” 

Clearly, the MDEQ, City of Flint and even the USEPA (with the 
obvious exception of Del Toral) have proved themselves 
unworthy of the public trust. Flint residents have been left to 
fend for themselves, when it comes to dealing with the dangers of 
high lead in their water. 


FlintWaterStudy was launched an hour after the phone call from 
Ms. Walters, to help the citizens of Flint deal with the lead-in- 
water crisis that MDEQ created, and to correct any false 
statements by uncaring agencies that have left Flint’s children in 
harm’s way.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

• DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 
representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHFIS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 1 6, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 

• Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCFID) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCFID is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 

• DHHS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

EPA Establishes Safe Drinking Water Task Force to Provide Technical Expertise to MDEQ and City of Flint 

Task Force providing technical assistance on reconnecting the Flint drinking water system to a new source 

CHICAGO (October 16, 2015) - Today U S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman 
established the Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through regular 
conversations with designated officials from Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the City of Flint. 
The Task Force will be led by the Region 5 Deputy Regional Administrator and will assist with developing and 
implementing a plan to secure water quality, including measures to optimize corrosion control. Task Force members will 
be available to consult with MDEQ and the City of Flint on site in Flint. The Task Force will also coordinate as necessary 
with federal, state and local public health agencies to assist with protection of public health. 

Specifically, the Task Force will provide technical assistance to the MDEQ and the City of Flint to reconnect the Flint 
system to a new source of drinking water (to be supplied by the Great Lakes Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion 
control for the Flint system, starting in October 2015. The Task Force will also provide technical assistance to the MDEQ 
and the City of Flint, as needed, in advance of and following connection of the Flint water system to a new source of 
drinking water (to be supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority) and to optimize corrosion control for the Flint system, 
starting in 201 6. 

“EPA is committed to working with our state and local partners to ensure a safe and reliable drinking water supply for the 
residents of Flint, Michigan,” Hedman said. “The formation of this task force continues our commitment to providing 
technical assistance to the City of Flint and the State of Michigan.” 

The Task Force will be comprised of scientists and technical experts from the EPA Region 5 office in Chicago, 
the National Risk Management Research Lab in Cincinnati and the EPA drinking water program. In addition, EPA will ask 
the Governor to designate a MDEQ official and the Mayor of Flint to designate a city official, to serve as points of contact 
for the Task Force.

About 


Corporations have been getting way with far too much for far too long. It is time that we, the citizens of the 
world, educate ourselves and take action against these Corporations. We all understand that, for past, few 
generations, we have allowed laws to be written, tax incentives to be created and have allowed loop holes to 
be made in environmental policy. We have allowed lobbiests in Washington , and other governments around 
the world, to make this capitalist institution called the "Corporation" get away with practices that are 
unacceptable. We have not understood the consequences until it is too late. We have felt too overwhelmed 
by the do's and don’ts that we have felt we had to respect, that we have allowed these powerhouses to 
benefit from massive profits, while we the majority are struggling. 

It is time that we the people take matters into our own hands. It is time to take responsibility for our 
ignorance. We must forgive ourselves for allowing this economic "Grand Canyon" between the mega wealthy 
and the other 90% of us. We hear our leaders ask us to make further sacrifices by accepting higher interest 
rates In order to pay for the mess they got us into. They have repeatedly tried to take away our voice. It is time 
forgive us our sins and move forward. We will no longer allow these Corporations and Government puppets to 
silence us. 

Like others before us, we are taking matters into our own hands. We are going to start keeping tabs on these 
Corporations. We are going to collect information and share it. We are going to spread the truth as far as we 
can. Most importantly we are going to take action! 


l 




Be a voice in a voiceless world. Share your knowledge of what you know with us so that we can unite and learn 
from each other, and become a source of power and change. 

Hey Corporations! We are watching you!

ABC 12 Investigates: What's in your water? 

Posted; Jdii 29. 2015 3;38 PM BST 
Updated: Jan 29, 201& limmEST 

By Larry Elliott . j" " CONNECT ) 

FUN I (WJRT) (01T29/iS : J- the resuitsareln aftd We now have a completely ihdep.hdenffedK at what's in 
Flint’s water su pply. 

For t&e Ftint Biyeras it’s wafer source, Flint wafer 

customers have complained of smelly, cloudy; bad tasting water and blame lifora variety of health 
problems. 

Complaints exploded earlier this month when Flint ncstlf ed its wafer customer:, fiat a group of chemicals 
known as TTHM were at much higher average- levels than allowed by jaw. 

With so many questions and distrust of the answers, ABC12‘s Larry Elliott investigates - What's in vour 
Water? 

It seems no matter who you ask in the Riot area, there's an opinion about the city’s water. Most o? She issues.; 
center on the quality of the water and whether it's safe to drink. 

"Right now it smeiis,'' said Flint resident Lee Miller. “We’re getting tyator oat of our own bank yard now arid ifs 
costing me doable what it was coming from Detroit." 

"i! has a funny taste to it." said Flint resident Milton Alexander. 

"It couid be dangerous to os. actually ! don't know how dangerous ii is," said Flint resident Sbarika Sanders. 

'I’m no cheerleader for the water department here, ithi nk we've got a tot of issues to wo rk on." Ken 
VanWagoner, of Good Beans Cafe - Flint. 

Most of the issues center on the quality of the wars' arid whether ifs safe to drink, but concern over its safety 
reached a new high earlier this month when the city was required by the slate Department of Environmental 
Quality to notify residents that the water had exceeded the allowable limit of a group of chemicais known as 
TTHM 

TTHM is in most municipal water systems and is thought by some to be a possible card nog so in. tong term 
: exposure; 

It's a byproduct of cbtonriatianywhich 1 is asmmonly used to help purify water. Last August, as Flint's water 
treatment plant worked to purify the water it was drawing from ins Flint River, levels of TTHM grew to wet! 
ove r the ERA allowed maximum . 

August test results provided by the DEQ to ABC 12 show all of the eight testing sites around Flint had TTHM 
levels well above the legal limit. 

The lowest level among the eight sites was 40 percent above the iegaf limit. The highest was MS percent 






[MU/ZU’ID 


abuiz investigates: vvnars in your water' - Atsu, iz-vvji-c i -runt, ivn 


more than allowed. 

DEQ rules only require the city to report higher than allowed levels to the public once a year, and only if the 
average of quarterly tests is higher than the legal limit 

That notification wentout to residents on Jan. 5. Since then, many residents have refused to believe 
assurances from the DEQ and the city that the water is now safe to drink. 

So, we set out to do complete and independent testing to find out for ourselves exactly what's in yourwater. 

It took a bit of research, but we finally found Water Tech, in Howell, a testing lab with absolutely no ties to 
Flint, just to make sure there are no questions about the test results. 

After having Water Tech train ABC12's Larry Elliott on the proper methods for collecting water samples, we 
set out last week to randomly test five sites in Flint. 

1. Downtown. 

"I'm excited to see this done because this is an independent way to find out that everything's just fine," 
VanWagonersaid. 

2. The north side. 

"We'd like to do kind ofa whole battery oftests of your water. Oh yeah," Alexander said. 

3. The west side. 

"It could be dangerous to us. How about if we help you find out what's in it right now?" Sanders said. 

4. The east side. 

"I'm hoping for a good test and put my family at ease," Miller said. 

5. Our main studio, on the south side. 

We also wanted to compare whatever we're to find with Detroit supplied water, so we took a sample from the 
Burton water system. 

Since next year Flint will connect to the new KWApipeline, getting its waterfrom Lake Huron, we tooka 
comparison sample from the Saginaw-Midland water system, which currently uses Lake Huron water. 

We tested all the sites for levels of TTHM. We also tested how much residual chlorine was in the Flint and 
Burton water supply and more importantly, we tested at two of our Flint sites for a number of other hazardous 
chemicals that could cause skin or other health problems. 

Tests for those other chemicals are not required for public water systems, but we decided to run those tests 
anyway. 

Here's what our independent testing shows: 

All sites tested, including the Saginaw-Midland water system and the Burton system, using Detroit water, 
contained TTHM - butall of them were well below the EPA allowed maximum. 

Saginaw-Midland water had less than a third of the maximum TTHM allowed, the Burton system had only 
about 25 percent ofthe maximum and the highest level found of all of our Flint tests showed just over 65 
percent of whafs allowed, all below EPA limits. 

A similar byproduct of chlorination, haloacetic acids, was also well below EPA maximums in Flint's water. 

We tested Flint’s north and east water samples for many other hazardous chemicals that a doctor told us 
could cause skin or other health problems, and on both tests, not a single one of those chemicals was 
detected. 

Since most often any smell to the water would be caused by levels of total residua! chlorine, we tested that 
too, in both our Fiintand Burton samples. 

The legal limit is 4 milligrams per liter. The average of our Flint samples shows a level of about a half 
milligram per liter. Our test in Burton actually shows 22 percent more residual chlorine than Flint. 

Our Flint sample also showed no Coliform bacteria. 

We asked Chris McCarthy, of Water Tech, a few questions.

Q: How would you describe these test results? 

A: "Well, for the samples received, the tests we performed, everything is within EPA guidelines for safe 
drinking water." 

Q: Is there anything in these results that raises a red flag for you? 

A: "For water quality or water safety, No.” 

We then asked residents if these results change their opinion of what they'll do with their water now. 

"To be honest, no," Alexander said. 

"It will make me feel a lot more comfortable about bathing and brushing my teeth in it, but I'm still not going to 
drink it and I'm not gonna give it to my kids or my dog," Sanders said. 

"It makes me feel a lot more safer, a lot more comfortable knowing that it's safe to drink now, you know. I'll tell 
you a load lifted off my shoulders. When the kids take baths, when my wife takes a shower, you know, I know 
now we're safe," Miller said. 

So what about those whoVe stood before Flint City Council with jugs of discolored water? 

While Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright points out he has no jurisdiction over Flint's water 
system, he says in general, discolored water like this is nearly always the result of water main breaks or 
repairs, and Flint has more than its share because of its aging system. 

Wright also says the KWA pipeline won't change that. It will take better management of repairs and money - 
lots of it- to replace Flint's aging water mains. 

Unfortunately for the city of Flint, those very high levels of TTHM recorded last August in Flint water tests are 
still required by the DEQto be included in the next report calculating average TTHM levels. 

The next test will be done next week, and city Public Works Director Howard Croft tells ABC12, because of 
the high levels last August, the city will again be found in violation and will be required by the DEQto send 
out another TTHM notice of violation to all Flint water customers in early March, even if all new tests show 
levels under the legal limit.

We (Treasury) think we can restructure the drinking water loans the City currently has. Essentially this 
means deferring the upcoming April & Oct principle payts. [ We can't forgive their loans nor extend the 
maturities], 

I am rounding the numbers... originally they had 4 loans totally $40+mm. The current amt outstanding 
is about $20mm. The cash benefit of deferring the principle payts is approx. $2. 1mm. 

I had talked to Jerry A. re where they would use the money. One possibility would be the consultant 
they are looking hire. The other is to pay for that pipeline replacement he talked about. 

I talked to Jim Sygo @ DEQ to see if they had any issues because they are responsible for the program 
side. He checked with his staff. They had some concerns about opening up 'Pandora's Box' i.e., other 
distress communities would want to do this. But at the end of the day I think they 
would ok the deferral particularly if you (the Gov's office) supported it. Jim had left me a v-mail so I can 
get back to him Monday to really confirm.

Thank you very much for your help. 


I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who took part in Tuesday's grant announcement press conference in Flint. 

I know that very, very busy people tore up their schedules to appear, or spent a great deal of time with me providing 
technical assistance and mentoring to bring everything together - even during the weekend and on a snow day. Your 
help is deeply appreciated! 

I think the coverage looks good so far, giving us a chance to change the narrative and explain the state's proper role 
helping the city with this long-standing issue. Here are some of the early stories: 

Governor awards Flint $2 million for troubled water system: Mayor says more is needed, MLive 
$2 minion in grant money coming to Flint to help with water situation, WJRT-12 
Snyder grants $2 million to Flint for troubled water system, Toldeo Blade (AP story) 

Thank you again, 

Dave

Es^§^^.MscK^sj;€or#e.C%-,dfFlfia^ City goyernpicfit 

to felajioiai solvency,, and working to ;$mvm that the City move s: forward: on a financially 
sustainabie basis. The steps taken over the past fhteeyeaM have beers difficult. Taxes and fees have 
been raised, servicesand workforce redrseed, avid; ongoing costs, including legacy costs, have been 
constrained. 

Hie emtent controversy surrounding the provision of water, and the path for resolution, has a 
potentially significant impact: on the: progress that is being made. I am satisfied that the water 
provided So Flint users today is within all MDEQ and EPA guidelines, as evidenced by the most 
reeentWater quality results conducted for MDEQ. We have a continuing cpnimilment to maintain 
water safety and to improve water ;^svuce this eormtufment 

will he made, 

City should return to DWSD, even for a short period of time, 
Would,, in mv judgment, have extremely negative dmucial conseguenees to the water system, and 
consequently to the rate payers. By the most conservative estimates, such a move would increase 
costs by at least $12 millioxr annually, with that amount achieved only by eliminating virtually all 
budgeted imptpyemcm the system. For a system with Unrestricted Assets ofonly $740,745, 
according to the June 30, 2014 audited financial statements, the only recourse within ihevCity'S 
control would be to increase revenues significantly. And in my judgment, dial would come from 
raising i^ps.fof Water by:30$i or more , Further, clianging the source of the eity % water would 
not necessarily change any of the aesthetky vf the water, including odor add discoloration, since 
those appear to be directly related to the aging pipes and otiicr isiiTastructiue that camywater fi'om 
the treatment: facility to o ur customers.

This direction of discussion also deviates from what, in my judgment, should be the focus: How 
can we not only operate and maintain a system to assure the delivery of safe and quality water 
dependably, but significantly reduce the cost of water and sewer to the users? At an average of 
$149 per month for water and sewer service for a residential user, the cost is extremely high in 
comparison to surrounding areas, as well as most areas across the state, and creates a significant 
financial burden for many users. In my judgment, we should all be concentrating on how to reduce 
rates by 50% or more. Unfortunately, there are no easy or evident answers, and continuation of 
the status will be an impediment to the sustainable recovery of the City of Flint. It is a conversation 
that I expect we will have with the recently created Water Quality Advisory Committee. 

My reasoning for this conclusion is as follows: 

One of the decisions made in the context of beginning to eliminate deficits and to restore financial 
stability to the City of Flint was to increase water and sewer rates significantly - the only choice 
available to financially stabilize a system that as of June 30, 2012, had a deficit of $8,758,091. 
Another was to leave DWDS for the KWA because it offered the opportunity to lower future rate 
increases. A third decision was to utilize the Flint River on an interim basis when DWSD 
unilaterally terminated the City’s contract for water purchase. That decision was made because it 
also offered an immediate cost savings opportunity which translated into the ability to upgrade the 
Water Treatment Plant without having to seek financing. It was a reasonable decision because of 
our experience in using the river in a back-up capacity, including test runs on a quarterly basis for 
several decades. 

Unfortunately, the switch to the river as a primary source was more challenging than anticipated, 
and the harsh winter of 20 1 3-20 1 4 resulted in much more damage to the aging water infrastructure 
than in previous years. The result was the issuance of required notices that water exceeded 
established guidelines for safety as it could affect certain vulnerable populations, and some users 
of the system experienced unpleasant odors and discoloration. Some users also appeared to have 
had some negative reactions to the new source of water. However, as soon as the test results were 
known. City staff took immediate actions to address the concerns. These actions are evidenced 
today by the fact that MDEQ has certified that our most recent testing shows water from all testing 
sites to be well within acceptable guidelines. Additionally, the City is continuing to taking the 
necessary actions to assure that the water supply remains safe and that water quality continues to 
improve. 

As the City has moved to address the situation, the suggestion continues to be made that the City 
should re-engage with DWSD and purchase water at least until the KWA pipeline is supplying 
water. As evidenced by the most recent letter from DWSD, such a decision would immediately 
increase the City’s cost by $846,700 per month, or $10,160,400 per year, just for the fixed cost 
portion of the price. The actual purchase of water would be an additional fee, and dependent upon 



Wayne Workman 
March 3, 2015 
Page 3 


the quantity purchased. We estimate the actual water purchase cost to average more than $ 1 million 
per month, for a grand total of approximately $22 million per year. Finally, the DWSD offer is 
conditioned upon the City (or presumably the KWA) agreeing to negotiate a long term contract 
(30 years) for back-up. 

The $22 million annual estimate of increased costs to purchase water from DWSD would be 
minimally offset by an approximate $3 million in reduced operating costs, and could be further 
offset by an additional $9 million, but only if all funding for capital improvements to the system 
are eliminated. To eliminate all funding dedicated to repairing, stabilizing, and improving the 
system would be totally irresponsible and would have long term negative consequences to the City 
and to future rate payers. 


As you are aware we have recently brought in outside expert assistance to evaluate the steps we 
have taken to assure that the water is safe and to continue to improve water quality. We are 
expecting specific recommendations within the next few weeks, and are committed to 
implementing those recommendations in a timely manner. Many steps have already been taken. I 
am confident that implementing their recommendations will assure a continuing supply of safe 
water as well as improved quality, and at far less cost than re-engaging DWSD. 

We have also created a 40-member Water Advisory Committee and a 13-member Technical 
Advisory Committee to assure two-way communication with the public and users of the system. 
Those committees will begin to meet this week, and we look forward to answering their questions 
and receiving their input. 

It is unfortunate that problems and concerns with quality have arisen, and we are working every 
day to address the issues that caused them. Maintaining safe water and improving quality is a top 
priority as we work to make the City of Flint an attractive place to live, work, study, and play.

Flint Lead TP O92415.docx; ATT00003.htm 


The memo and attachments below have captured the latest information from the departmental side on Flint 
succinctly. Kildee is engaged in his normal press hound routine, which is unfortunate because he's really a smart, 
talented guy who needs to roll up his sleeves while Ananich is looking for relief but doesn't know where it would come 
from and as usual is a positive force. 

Frankly, I think both know that Walling went out on CYA effort due to the election, but of course can't say so. Neither 
has any idea where his $30M figure came from, or where we would get it even if you were so inclined. 

Originally the thrust for the KWA came from the Genesee County commission and those involved in the planning for 
KWA including the Trades. By the time the council had voted 7-1 for it, Andy Dillon was in the position of signing off on 
it and did. However, it was still the right position for the long term benefit of the city and its future. They of course 
have not been particularly helpful in finding solutions to the issues. I will say that the Drain Commissioner has been a 
good partner and is working overtime on the problem. 

They can't reconnect to DWSD even if they wanted to as they sold the connector line. And, especially with the new rate 
increases in Detroit, their citizens would be less able to pay than they already are. The water certainly has occasional 
less than savory aspects like color because of the apparently more corrosive aspects of the hard water coming from the 
river, but that has died down with the additional main filters. Taste and smell have been problems also and substantial 
money has been extended to work on those issues. 

Now we have the anti everything group turning to the lead content which is a concern for everyone, but DEQ and DHHS 
and EPA can't find evidence of a major change per Geralyn's memo below. Of course, some of the Flint people respond 
by looking for someone to blame instead of working to reduce anxiety. We can't tolerate increased lead levels in any 
event, but it's really the city's water system that needs to deal with it. We're throwing as much assistance as possible at 
the lead problem as regardless of what the levels, explanations or proposed solutions, the residents and particularly the 
poor need help to deal with it. 

It seems that continuing to find funds to buy local residents home filters is really a viable option and Harvey and all are 
pursuing more assistance in that work. Almost all the "experts" I've talked to are convinced the problem is in the old 
lines leading to homes and short of a massive replacement CSO type bond that wouldn't resolve the issue for a couple of 
years, nature (temp reductions), filters and a final connect seem to be the best courses of action. 

The residents are caught in a swirl of misinformation and long term distrust of local government unlikely to be 
resolved.

Subject: Update 


Quick recap on the interactions this week from the MDHHS side on the Flint water issue. 


Today the City of Flint issued the attached "Lead Advisory" for residents to be aware of lead levels in 
drinking water and issued suggestions from the Genesee County Health Department as to what 
residents could do to reduce risk. These include: 

-- flushing cold-water pipes by running water for approximately 5 minutes, 

--using only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking and making baby formula 
--installing a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. 


We worked with the Genesee County Health Department throughout the week to get them in a more 
pro-active mode to provide this guidance publicly and to encourage citizens to have the City test their 
water if they were concerned about the quality of water at their home. The health department also 
issued this fact sheet 

.h.^8. : //www,£chd.us^do^ 2 .pdf on Thursday 

providing additional information on the issue. 


MDHHS epidemiologists continue to review the "data" provided by a Hurley hospital physician that 
showed an increase in lead activity following the change in water supply. While we continue to review 
this data, we have stated publicly that Hurley conducted their analysis in a much different way than we 
do at the department. Hurley used two partial years of data, MDHHS looked at five comprehensive 
years and saw no increase outside the normal seasonal increases. The Hurley review was also a much 
smaller sample than MDHHS data as ours includes all hospital systems in Flint as well as outside 
laboratories. 


We have also provide the attached data chart that outlines if the elevated blood lead levels were being 
driven by a change in water, we would have seen the elevated levels remain high after the change in 
water source. 


We have also communicated that for WIC beneficiaries in Flint with documentation of unsanitary water, 
they may be able to receive ready to feed formula and have encouraged families to contact WIC to see if 
they are eligible for this formula. SNAP beneficiaries are able to purchase bottled water with their SNAP 
funds. 


Talking points from MDHHS are attached as well. 

Thank you,

For Immediate Release 

City of Flint Issues Lead Advisory 

Flint, Michigan - September 25, 2015 - The City of Flint is issuing a Lead Advisory for 
residents to be aware of lead levels in drinking water after hearing concerns from the 
medical community. While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to 
ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe. 

The Genesee County Health Department has issued a fact sheet regarding lead 
precautions for residents. The fact sheet can be found on their website at www.achd.us . 
Here are a few of the suggestions the Health Department recommends: 

■ Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes 

■ Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. 

■ Install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. 

Lead contamination can leach into water from a home’s lead water service lines, lead 
solder, and leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. Older 
service lines with pipes and fixtures installed before 1986 can sometimes be more 
susceptible to lead issues due to materials used in the home such as lead based paint 
and lead pipes. 

This message is meant as a precaution to residents and does not mean that all homes in 
th e City will experience the same issue. Residents with concerns about lead service lin es

and lead in home plumbing fixtures are encouraged to contact the City’s Utilities Division 
to schedule a free water testing by calling the Water Treatment Plant at 810-787-6537 
and pressing #1 after prompted or by emailing flintwater@cityofflint.com . 

The City of Flint is working proactively along with the County Health Department, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to improve the water system throughout the City. An accelerated plan to add a 
corrosion control agent to our water within 30 to 60 days with expedited approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is already underway. This will reduce 
corrosion which can cause lead in old pipes to leach into the water. 

This plan is in addition to Mayor Walling’s letter requesting $30 Million in water 
infrastructure assistance funding from the State of Michigan. $10 Million of that request 
would be for the replacement of lead service lines in households to ensure that lead no 
longer presents a danger to the drinking water of our residents. As the letter states, “It is 
the City’s position that the abatement of lead through the removal of lead containing pipes 
and fixtures in homes is the best long term solution to keeping our residents’ water safe.” 

Mayor Walling further stated: "I am extremely concerned about the risks around lead with 
Flint's children and I will be working tirelessly to ensure the water is safe and all of our 
families have the information they need. I also will continue to pursue funding for 
infrastructure improvements and a comprehensive healthy homes initiative that 
addresses lead in paint and pipes. We have to get the lead out of our community to 
eliminate the threat of childhood lead poisoning." 

The City of Flint continues working proactively with the County Health Department, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to improve the water system throughout the City. The City remains committed to 
working with all of our partners in the Water Technical Advisory Committee to address all

issues of public health and quality concerns that face the community. Updates on 
progress made in addressing this issue will be made during regular public meetings 
including City Council and other scheduled meetings. Information on this and all related 
matters will continue to be posted on the City of Flint’s website, cityofflint.com.

Blood Lead Testing of Children in Flint, Before and After the Change in Flint's Water 


The change in Flint's water source occurred in 
April 2014. MDHHS looked at children's blood 
lead levels (BLL) before and after this event. 

The dark blue line (May 2014 - April 2015) and 
the green line (May-August 2015) reflect 
children's blood lead tests after the change. All 
other lines reflect tests before the change. 

An increase in childhood lead poisoning in 
summer (July, August, September) is typical 
throughout Michigan every year. 

While there is a dramatic difference between the 
numbers of elevated BLL in the summer before 
and after the event, a wider look that includes 
data back to 2010 shows that the year BEFORE 
the event (the yellow line) was more of an 
anomaly than the year after (the dark blue line). 

If elevated BLL were being driven by the change 
in water, we would expect the dark blue line to 
stay high rather than follow the seasonal 
pattern. 

All data included in this analysis were reported 
by laboratories directly to MDHHS, in 
accordance with State law.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 

• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

• All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 

• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 



WIC Children 


• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

Team, 

DHHS is sending out this update on Flint blood lead testing this afternoon. Preliminary data indicates that 30 of 
1,361 adults and children tested in Flint since October 1 had elevated blood lead levels, according to a report 
issued today by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 

We've worked with the folks there to make the release as reader friendly and people focused as possible, and 
also to show some historical context. The graph on the PDF is particularly effective, showing that levels were 
just as high in 2010. 

Please share any concerns you may have.

MDHHS releases latest data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care , case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - Preliminary data indicates that 30 of 1,361 adults and children tested in Flint 
since October 1 had elevated blood lead levels, according to a report issued today by the 
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 

This marks the first summary report on lead testing called for in the state’s action plan related to 
health concerns about Flint’s water infrastructure. 

“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, 
MDHHS chief medical executive. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those with 
elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with the Genesee 
County Health Department to reach these families. We will remain diligent in our ongoing 
outreach and education efforts.” 

Information comes from tests administered citywide to 1,361 children and adults since October 
1. Tests showed that 21 of 969 children age 17 or younger and 9 of 392 adults over the age 18 
were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The report covers test results reported to MDHHS since the state action plan was put in place 
Oct. 2. It includes the number of tests and number of elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 
micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary and venous blood tests that have been 
reported to MDHHS since the beginning of October. People who have had multiple tests are 
counted only once. Five micrograms per deciliter is the level that the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention considers elevated and triggers health care professional follow up with families. 

The full report is posted online at www. michi gan, go v/flint water and will be updated as more 
data becomes available. 

When reviewing historical trend data, the risk of lead exposure is highest during the third quarter 
of each year - July through September. Seasonal variation is the result of a number of factors 
including increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in the summer months. 

In the third quarter of 2010, 8.3 percent of Flint children 6 and under showed elevated blood lead 
levels. The figure gradually decreased to 4. 1 percent in the third quarter of 2013. During the 
same months in 2014, the figure increased to 7.5 percent and decreased to 6.4 percent in the third 
quarter of 2015.

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letters to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
The state is providing funding for GCFCD nurses to work with families when an elevated blood 
lead level has been detected. During these follow-up visits, nurses coordinate with environmental 
health investigators to meet with families in their homes to identify lead exposures, address 
questions and provide water filters. People can be exposed to lead from paint, soil, plumbing and 
other sources. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations, including the MDF1HS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of distribution, visit 

www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 


To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional video on its YouTube channel . For

Calley, Brian (GOV); Snyder, Rick (GOV); Clement, Elizabeth (GOV); Scott, Allison (GOV) 
Subject: BRIEFING: Auditor General answers on Flint water situation 

Attachments: Auditor General Letter - City of Flint Drinking Water (002). pdf 


Colleagues: 

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly posed by Sen. Jim 
Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The questions came as the OAG conducts an 
audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint River as an interim 
water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency purposes in 2006. The treated 
water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint had never tested its effect on the distribution 
system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only one email 
exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control program; the DEQ 
responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion control. DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its 
program to monitor a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month 
periods to determine optimal corrosion treatment. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully 
misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have notified 
management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the 
switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six-month 
monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: 
corrosion controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month sampling results 
arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 

DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water 
samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's 
certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should consider an independent verification of the sampling pool 
or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water 
samples came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this 
Wednesday (12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six-month review. It 
was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It was also appropriate for DEQ to 
require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't contain overly stagnant water. 

l 



Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. The report said it's 
tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy. 

The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in case you want to review the timeline on page 
11 .

The Honorable Jim Ananich 

Senate Minority Leader ..j§||§ |F |k 

State Capitol, Room S-105 
Lansing, Michigan 

Dear Senator Ananich: 

Enclosed are answers to the questions you posed in your October 20, 2015 letter to our 
office regarding the audit we are conducting of the Office dt Drinking Water and Municipal 
Assistance (ODWMA), Department of Environmental Ouality (DEQ), specific to lead 
contamination in the City of Flint's drinking watef, Also enclosed are additional questions 
we developed that are relevant to these issues, along with five exhibits: 

• A map showing Flint water simples byi zip code. 

• A map showing lead counts of 5 partsiper billion or higher. 

• Two charts showing the number of samples by time period and zip code. 

• A time line of the Flint water review. 

We appreciate the opportunity to assist you in answering questions regarding this topic. If 
you have further questions or a request for other services, please do not hesitate to 
contact our officeTT J 

isix. Sincerely, 


Doug Ring I er 

T: :: Auditor General 

Encibflifes .Jill* 



Q1 : How does ODWMA ensure the data it receives is accurate? 

A: With regard to the United States Environmental Protection A genc y (EPA) Lead 
and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring requirements, DEQ relies on the following key 
controls to ensure the accuracy of test results: 

• State-owned laboratories test water samples, 

• State-owned laboratories send test results directly to QSDL 

• The City of Flint Water Treatment Plant (Flint WTP) certifies whether 

sample sites are classified as tier 1*, 

The current Flint WTP LCR sampling process includes 

1 . DEO informs the Flint WTP of the- required water lead and copper 
sample size. 

2. The Flint WTP determines the pool of tier 1 sites for sampling. 

3. The Flint WTP setectPHe sample. 

4. The Flint WTP sends out sample kits and instructions to residents for 
collecting water samples. j||§fl r '' : 

5. Residents leave samples and signed sampling forms outside their front 
doors. 

6. The Flint WTP employee picks up samples and forms from residents. 

X The Flint WTP efffpfbyee reviews sample forms for completeness. 

8. The Flint WTP employee sends samples to the State-owned 
laboratories. 

% State-owned laboratories test samples and provide results directly to 

I iIIIIeq. 

10. DEQ receives water lead and copper sample results, which include 
the following information: date collected, date received, address 
where collected, type of residence (e.g., single family or apartment), 
and sample point (e.g., kitchen sink or bathroom sink). 

\ 11. DEQ tracks, and follows up if necessary, the number of samples 

collected by the Flint WTP to help ensure that the required minimum 
number of samples are collected by the monitoring period deadline. 


Single-family or multiple-family residence with lead service line, lead solder copper piping 
constructed after 1982, or lead plumbing. 


Page 1 


1 2. The Flint WTP submits lead and copper report to DEQ that certifies 
whether sample sites meet tier 1 criteria. 

13. DEQ prepares the LCR 90th percentile calculation report. 

During our review, we noted two potential improvements for the Flint WTP 
sampling process (see Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the 
OAG regarding tier 1 sample validity): 

• DEQ could verify that the sampling pool was limited to only tier 1 sample 
sites to ensure that the Flint WTP is in compliance with the LCR 

(Title 40, Part 141, section 86(a)(3) of the Code of Federal Regulations 
[ CFR ]). 

• DEQ could independently verify the validity of sample Mil fortifications. 


Q2: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who fail to l|||vv data 

verification protocols? A 

A: DEQ does not provide any direct oversight over the Flint WTP and, therefore, 
does not have any accountability measures over the Flint WTP's LCR data 
verification protocols. DEQ's data verification protocol for lead and copper 
water sampling is limited to verification that the WTP certifies samples 
submitted to the State-owned laboratories for analysts (see steps 7 and 1 2 in 
the Flint WTP LCR sampling process noted in Question 1 above). We did not 
identify any instances in which ODWMA staff failed to verify that submitted 
samples were certified by the Flint WTP. 


Q3: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who lie or 

misrepresent information to the EPA? 

A: As with all classified employees, ODWMA staff must adhere to the rules and 
regulations established by the Michigan Civil Service Commission. If any 
ODWMA staff were determined to misrepresent information to the EPA, they 
would be sybj^ot to Civil Service Rule 2-6, Discipline, which allows an 
appointing authority to discipline an employee for just cause up to and including 
dismissal. #e are not aware of any DEQ-established measures that are in 
addition to the Civil Service Rules. 

We gained access to the e-mail accounts of key DEQ management (DEQ 
Director, Deputy Director, ODWMA Chief, and other key ODWMA staff) 
extending back to January 1 , 2013. We did so to identify the key decision 
points and conversations that occurred leading up to and through the situation in 
Flint. Our review was also intended to determine whether State, Flint, or other 
officials attempted to conceal key test results or other information. 

We noted one e-mail exchange between DEQ and the EPA that appears to be a 
significant contributor to the concern that DEQ misrepresented information to 
the EPA. The EPA requested clarification on February 26, 2015 regarding the 
type of optimized corrosion control treatment the Flint WTP was using. DEQ 
responded on February 27, 2015 that the city had an optimized corrosion 
control program in place, but DEQ did not provide any program details. DEQ 
informed us that the Flint WTP corrosion control program included performing 


Page 2 



lead and copper monitoring for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 
whether corrosion control treatment would be necessary in the future. 

However, it appears the EPA interpreted corrosion control program to mean that 
corrosion control treatment was being performed. 

On April 23, 201 5, the EPA again inquired as to what the Flint WTP was doing 
for corrosion control treatment. DEQ responded on April 24, 2015 that the Flint 
WTP was not practicing corrosion control treatment. 

Based on our review of this and other e-mails, we have no specific reason to 
believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented the information to the EPA. 


Q4: What policies do DEQ and ODWMA have in place to escalate major infractions up 

the chain of command? 

A: We did not note any instances of major infractions (i.e., intentional disregard of 
policies, laws, regulations or specific directions) committed by DEQ staff during 
the course of our review. DEQ does not have a formal policy or procedure in 
place to escalate major infractions performed by ODWMA employees; however, 
our review of DEQ correspondence confirmed the e||pation of key issues up the 
chain of command related to the Flint situation, DEQ stated that its informal 
policy is for staff to notify the proper level of management of infractions to 
determine necessary action. 




Application of the LCR 

Q1 : How did the Flint WTP become the primary water supplier for th%City of Flint? 

A: Upon notification of the City of Flint's plans to switch to the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) in April 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewefage Department 
(DWSD) submitted a letter to the City of Flint stating that ft would terminate its 
agreement to provide water services on April 17, 2014. 

According to DEQ management, the Flint WTP attempted to negotiate with the 
DWSD to maintain it as the City of Flint water supplier; however, after 
negotiations were unsuccessful, the City of Flint notified DEQ through a permit 
request of its intent to operate the Flint WTP full time using the Flint Rivet. 
Although the Flint City Council voted in March 2013 it|:support of moving to the 
KWA pipeline, the vote was silent on the use of the Flint River as a temporary 
drinking water source. J||: || 

The Flint River was approved by DEQ in 2006 as a backup source of water for 
emergency purposes prior to the switch from the DWSD WTP to the Flint WTP. 
On a quarterly basis, the Flint WTP tested the treated Flint River water at the 
Flint WTP, which met water qualify standards; however, the Flint WTP did not 
test the water's effect on |||: ;; distribution system at consumer tap locations. 


Q2. Did DEQ consult with the EPA prior to determining how to apply the LCR? 

A: DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how to apply the LCR prior to 

implementing two consecutive six-month monitoring periods of the Flint WTP 
beginning July 1 , 2014, Based on p!§t experiences applying the LCR monitoring 
requirements, DEQ believed that it had appropriately applied the LCR 
requirements of a large water system. 


Q3: When Flint switched to the Flint River water source, should corrosion control 

treatment have been r|||jptained? 

A: We believe that corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 

According to the LCR, a water system can achieve optimized corrosion control if 
it submits results of tap water monitoring for two consecutive six-month 
monitoring periods with acceptable lead levels. However, a water system that 
has optimized corrosion control, and which has treatment in place, should 
x continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment. 

DEllpaff explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a 
new system, but as a new source. DEQ further stated that because the Flint 
River was a new water source and there was a change in chemicals needed to 
treat the new source, a corrosion control study was needed to determine the 
impact on the water distribution system. Therefore, it was DEQ's interpretation 
that two rounds of six-month monitoring were still needed to evaluate the water 
quality and determine optimal corrosion control treatment. 


Page 4 


The Flint water system had optimal corrosion control treatment when the DWSD 
WTP was the water supplier. Based on our review of notes from a July 21 , 
2015 EPA and DEQ conference call on DEQ's implementation of the LCR 
regarding whether the Flint WTP should have continued to maintain corrosion 
control treatment, it appeared that the EPA did not agree with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR. Region 5 EPA staff explained that they would talk to 
the EPA headquarters about the interpretation of regulations and believes that 
systems that have been deemed optimized need to "maintain" corrosion control. 
The Region agreed to provide supporting regulatory citation%|||the language 
about maintaining corrosion control. 

On November 3, 201 5, the EPA issued a memorandum stating that the LCR had 
differing possible interpretations; however, the EPA concluded that it is 
important for large water systems to take the steps necessary to ensure that 
appropriate corrosion control treatment is maintained at all times, thus ensuring 
that public health is protected. Based on this clarification, it appears that 
corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 


Q4: Should DEQ have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized corrosion r 

control treatment after the first round of six-month sampling results were above the 
lead action level of 5 parts per billion (ppb)? 

A: Yes. According to DEO's application of the LCR, within six months after the 
end of the monitoring period in which the water sample results exceeded the 
acceptable lead level, DEQ should have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing 
optimized corrosion contrlllleatment. 

The LCR states that the lead action level is exceeded if the lead level, as 
determined by the 90th percentile calculation, is greater than 15 ppb. If the 
lead action level is exceeded, water Systems are required to take additional 
actions Including educating the public about lead in drinking water as well as 
commencing lead service line replacement if the water system has already 
installed corrosion control and/or source water treatment. However, for water 
systems that have not yet implemented corrosion control treatment, they can be 
deemed to have optimized corrosion control without installing treatment if they 
can demonstrat'd lead levels below 5 ppb for two consecutive six-month periods. 

The first round of six-month sampling results was received in late March 2015. 
Because the results were 1 ppb over the lead action level of 5 ppb, DEQ would 
not be able to achieve two consecutive six-month periods below 5 ppb. 
Therefore, DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized 
corrosion control treatment. However, DEQ waited until the second round of 
sampling was completed (June 30, 2015) to assess whether water sample 
results improved. 

Water Samples 

Q5: Did D£Q verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected by the Flint WTP in the 

two roiMds of six-month samples? 

A: DEQ did not verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected. DEQ relies on 
the Flint WTP’s certification of sample sites and does not perform any 
independent verification of those certifications. 


Page 5 



In a November 19, 2015 Flint Journal article, the Flint WTP indicated that it did 
not have the ability to ensure that all sites were tier 1 . In fact, water samples 
came from the random distribution of 175 testing bottles without regard for 
whether the homes were at risk for high lead levels. DEQ issued a formal 
memorandum on November 9, 2015 requesting that the Flint WTP verify the 
classification of all prior sample items. The results are due back from the Flint 
WTP on December 30, 201 5. 


Q6: DEQ dropped two water sampling sites from its second six-month sample 

(January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015). Was this appropriate? 

A: Yes, it was appropriate for DEQ to drop these two water sampling sites. Federal 
regulation 40 CFR 141 .86(a) states: 

"... each water system shall complete a materials evaluation 
of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted: 
sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section . . . 

All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be 
selected from this pool . . . Sampling sites mayliqt include 
faucets that have point-of-use of point-of-entry treatment 
devices designed to remove inorgante contaminants." 

This regulation also requires that a water system's targeted sampling pool 
consist of only tier 1 sampling sites if an adequate number is available to meet 
monitoring requirements. 

According to federal regulation 40 CFR 141 .86(1), the State may invalidate a 
water sample if it determines that the sarrpf& v :was taken from a site that did not 
meet the site selection criteria, A sample invalidated per this regulation does 
not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels or toward 
meeting the minimum monitoring requirements. 

DEQ dropped one water sample stte from its 90th percentile calculations 
because the site was from a business that does not meet the tier 1 requirements 
of being a single-family or multiple-family residence. The second sample site 
was dropped because the home had a point-of-entry treatment device to filter 
contaminants, Based on the criteria specified above, it appears that DEQ’s 
rationale for dropping the samples from these two sites appropriately met the 
requirements for invalidating samples per federal regulation 40 CFR 141.86. 


Q7: Was flushing of the taps the night before drawing a sample an appropriate sample 

methodology? 

A: Yes. The LCR requires that samples be a first draw of water after six hours of 
: stagnation. The LCR does not indicate whether or not the water line should be 
flushed prior to collecting the sample. In the sample instructions, DEQ required 
preflushing to ensure that sampled faucets were not stagnant for an excessive 
period of time beyond the targeted six hours (e.g., rarely used faucets or when a 
horrifbwner has been gone for an extended period of time.) 

The LCR requires six hours of stagnation; however, it does not preclude DEQ 
from instructing residents to flush prior to stagnation. 


Page 6 




In calendar year 1992, the Flint WTP established a tier 1 sample site pool for LCR 
monitoring. With the change to the Flint River water, the Flint WTP needed to increase the 
pool of sample locations because of additional sampling requirements. The following 
exhibit documents the 2014 and 201 5 sample locations for LCR monitoring. Based on the 
data obtained during our review, we could not determine how the locations were selected 
or whether they were properly classified as tier 1 sample sites. 

As noted in Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the OAG, DEQ has 
requested the Flint WTP to verify the tier 1 classification of ail prior sample items.

Colleagues: 

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly 
posed by Sen. Jim Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The 
questions came as the OAG conducts an audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's 
handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint 
River as an interim water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency 
purposes in 2006. The treated water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint 
had never tested its effect on the distribution system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only 
one email exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion 
control program; the DEQ responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA 
asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion 
control. DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its program to monitor a new water 
source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 
optimal corrosion treatment. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully 
misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have 
notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring 
practices after the switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so 
correctly by doing two rounds of six-month monitoring on the new water source before determining 
optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that 
the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: corrosion controls already in 
place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month 
sampling results arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 



DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is 
collecting water samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or 
plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should 
consider an independent verification of the sampling pool or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, 
Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water samples came from 175 
randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this Wednesday 
(12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six- 
month review. It was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It 
was also appropriate for DEQ to require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't 
contain overly stagnant water. 

Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. 
The report said it's tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy. 

The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in case you want to review the 
timeline on page 11.

This is the best narrative I have seen that actually describes how we feel about the situation and our resolve to make 
things right. A few thoughts: 

We might think about a "lead in" to your second para in the statement. Something like "The bi-partisan task force has 
worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, State and Federal officials and complete an independent fact based 
analysis. They have reviewed hundreds of documents at all levels of government and from the public health science 
community and continue to do so. 

Para 3 might unintentionally suggest that there are public health stakeholders who are not as serious as the 
governor. This may be an overreach, but may I suggest 

"When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, there is simply no room for error in testing for lead and other 
toxins. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community. That is why I have directed my 
Directors of MDEQand DHHS to invite every external scientist who has worked on the Flint water issue to the state 
laboratory facilities to work as partners with us. Together, we should be able to affirm that every testing protocol and 
conclusion validates that Flint citizens will have safe drinking water, and that we are doing everything possible to ensure 
proper monitoring and remediation of blood levels and physical or neurological impacts over the long term. And I want 
the Flint community and all citizens of Michigan to know how very sorry I am that this has happened." 

Nick and Dan might not like the "invite" but I spoken with them both and they of course will support whatever the Boss 
decides.

I totally agree with going so far as to specifically apologize. I also like Rich's suggestions. The statement should convey

I think this statement accomplishes those goals.

report may not come out for another month at least) and to signal that action may come sooner than 
that (we plan to reach out to Mayor Weaver, for example, and perhaps hold a press conference with her 
in January announcing some next steps). 

Flere is the statement: 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've 
read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to monitor Flint 
water. 

"No matter what the testing requirements were, they were not enough to prevent this crisis. I want 
Michigan to be the state that is known for the safest water in the nation.

uncover more facts, it's clear to me we can do better. The report may take another month or so, but if 
we need to make changes more swiftly, I plan to take immediate action.

"The bottom line is we'll take responsibility for our part in Flint's water crisis. I'm committed to 
partnering with all of the stakeholders who are as concerned about public health as I am. I vow to make 
sure that Flint citizens will have safe drinking water. And I'm so very sorry that this happened. 

"But I know an apology isn't enough. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute 
water filters, and help in other ways. On Thursday, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going 
to sit down in the next week to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance.

RE: Please provide feedback: Governor's statement on Flint water crisis 


Hi Meegan, I hope you are enjoying the holidays in between your first few weeks on the job, 

I do like the tone and intention of the statement and appreciate the direction you intend for you communication. 

That being said, and truly by way of background for you (and some miid venting for me), it does frustrate me that the 
City of Flint and Genessee county, and their respective elected bodies, are seemingly getting a pass in the media despite 
the fact that it was their collective decision to not only build their own water system, but to break from DWSD before 
that new system was done and to draft from the Flint River in the interim. The State certainly could have done better 
following those decisions by local officials, but it seems to me that those same officials should be held to some level of 
accountability, as well. 

Thanks, and Happy New Year. I am in today, but leaving for the MSU-Alabama game tomorrow.

I hear you, John. The auditor Setter to Jim Ananich makes some of your points dearly, but I'm not sure the media is all that

Subject: Update on OAG letter and our statement 


Colleagues, 

The Office of the Auditor General has released the letter. We've developed a statement, based on the 
summary you read the other night, that spells out how things came down. We hope media will pick up on the 
fact that the DEQ was largely following protocols, or in one case, an ambiguous one that EPA later clarified. 

FYI - Sen. Ananich has released the following in regard to the OAG letter: "The Auditor General has provided 
an important piece of this puzzle and I'm sure the extended report they are working on will reveal additional 
information," said Ananich. "What's clear is that corrosion control should have been used and there are 
serious failings in our system that must be addressed. Between the FOIA emails released recently and these 
findings, it's obvious that legislative oversight is the best way to see how all of these pieces fit together. I 
expect holding hearings to be high on the agenda when the Legislature returns." 

On Tuesday, we plan to release this statement by the Governor. It's been tweaked slightly since our review the 
other night, thanks to feedback from the Governor, Jim Redford and others. 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and I've read the

So as not to clog the email waves, just checking in with you 3 - statement looks good. I could be a two handed lawyer 
and argue both ways as to release - but in this case I am personally comfortable with a quicker release. 

BTW - our van is packed and the Walsh Detroit to Dallas or Bust trip is about to begin! Will be reachable by phone, and 
will check emails when I am not driving.

Subject: Update on OAG letter and our statement 



Colleagues, 

The Office of the Auditor General has released the letter. We've developed a statement, based 
on the summary you read the other night, that spells out how things came down. We hope 
media will pick up on the fact that the DEO was largely following protocols, or in one case, an 
ambiguous one that EPA later clarified. 


l 



FYI - Sen. Ananich has released the following in regard to the OAG letter: "The Auditor General 
has provided an important piece of this puzzle and I'm sure the extended report they are 
working on will reveal additional information," said Ananich. "What's clear is that corrosion 
control should have been used and there are serious failings in our system that must be 
addressed. Between the FOIA emails released recently and these findings, it's obvious that 
legislative oversight is the best way to see how all of these pieces fit together. I expect holding 
hearings to be high on the agenda when the Legislature returns." 

On Tuesday, we plan to release this statement by the Governor. It's been tweaked slightly since 
our review the other night, thanks to feedback from the Governor, Jim Redford and others. 

"I've been briefed on the recent meeting of the task force studying the Flint water situation and 
I've read the report from the Office of the Auditor General on the processes used by DEQ to 
monitor Flint water. 

"The bi-partisan task force has worked tirelessly to interview Flint, Genesee County, state and

Flint water statement 


Here is a statement from the Governor that will go out around 2-2:30 p.m. to the media. We'll also give a heads up to 
executive staffers and some others. - Meegan 


When I became aware that the city of Flint's water showed elevated lead levels and that the state's handling of the 
situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the Great Lakes Water Authority and 
appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 

The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of Flint, Genesee 
County, state and federal officials. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, it has made me aware of some interim findings and 
corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe 
and informed. 

We'll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns. 

In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I've determined that it's appropriate to accept it. 
I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force. 

But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific 
community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services 
to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping us improve Flint water. Let's 
share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at accurate and mutually supported 
conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint 
residents have safe drinking water and that we're taking steps to protect their health over the short and long term. 

I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan citizens to know 
that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure. 

I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That's why I'm taking the actions today to ensure a 
culture of openness and trust. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in 
other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state 
can offer assistance. 

These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our task force. 

When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything we can to protect the well- 
being of our citizens.

Subject: FYI- Release going shortly re: Flint Emergency Declaration 


Good afternoon, 

Just wanted you all to know that we're issuing the following press release shortly regarding the Governor declaring an 
emergency in Genesee County and activating the State Emergency Operations Center. The declaration will be attached 
with it. 

Thanks! 

Gov. Snyder declares emergency for Genesee County 

State Emergency Operations Center activated to assist with relief efforts 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today declared a state of emergency for Genesee County 
due to the ongoing health and safety issues caused by lead in the city of Flint’s drinking water. 

By declaring a state of emergency, Snyder has made available all state resources in cooperation 
with local response and recovery operations. The declaration authorizes the Michigan State 
Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division (MSP/EMHSD) to coordinate 
state efforts. 

“The health and welfare of Flint residents is a top priority and we’re committed to a coordinated 
approach with resources from state agencies to address all aspects of this situation,” Snyder said. 
“Working in full partnership with the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, all levels of government and 
water quality experts, we will find both short-term and long-term solutions to ensure the health and 
safety of Flint residents.” 

In addition to the emergency declaration, Snyder activated the State Emergency Operations 
Center to coordinate state response and recovery activities. State agencies will report to the 
center to coordinate resources, assess the situation and begin providing assets to assist with local 
relief operations. 

“Our staff recognizes the urgency of this situation and is already working closely with local 
officials,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, Deputy State Director of Emergency Management and 
Homeland Security and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. “We will continue to collaborate with 
state, city and county leaders to coordinate relief efforts, streamline communication and use all 
available resources to help residents.” 

On Jan. 4, Genesee County declared a “local state of emergency,” which activated local 
emergency response and recovery plans. By requesting a governor’s declaration, the county has 
determined local resources are insufficient to address the situation and state assistance is 


i 



required to protect public health, safety and property to lessen or avert the threat of a crisis. 

The city of Flint has been under a local emergency declaration since Dec. 14, 2015. 

The SEOC is the emergency operations center for the state of Michigan. Located in Lansing, the 
center is overseen by the MSP/EMHSD and coordinates response and recovery efforts by state 
agencies and local government. The SEOC is staffed by members of state agencies and other 
partners for decision making and information coordination during disasters or emergencies in the 
state of Michigan.

Dear Governor Snyder: 

I heard the news article about the increased lead in children in some areas of Flint after the city switched 
water suppliers. This is simply advanced technology that was used by the Romans to purify their water 
adapted to work inside the body. 

This is the product that is going to be available soon that I told you about that guy in East Texas was using that 
his strength increased 30% after 10 days. He is the guy whose ex-wife tried to kill him with arsenic. After 3 
weeks on the product, he is now saying that maybe he should stop taking it because he does not know what to 
do with all the energy that he now has. 


Sincerely 



i 






^ )} Iffill a Healthy 
Baby? 



What mother would ever ask to have a child who is born without all of 
its faculties or 100% of the gift of life they were dreaming of bringing 
into this world. If this is so then why is it that rates of SIDS, birth 
defects, cancer, ADD, ADHD, Autism, Asperger's and other "issues" have 
become so prevalent today? This all starts with Mom. Ladies you are 
the initial cause of your child's health issues. 

Your Mom and Dad always said they hoped you have a child that was 
just like you. You did, unfortunately you give your baby all of the good in 
your genes as well as much of the bad that is stored in your body. 

Toxins and chemicals that are stored in fat and other tissues in your 
body are pushed across the placenta into your fetus from day one of 
conception. It is through this process that the game of chance begins. It 
is Survivor the real game as your baby is tested as to whether it can 
develop in the toxic soup you create for it. If this environment is too 
much to bear, you miscarry. Some women aren't even able to conceive 
because of being so toxic. 

Maybe you've miscarried once, twice, four, eight times or more before 
you were able to have a child. This process is your body's natural 
attempt to create a better environment for you to survive. Unfortunately 
it has terrible consequences on your mental well being. 

This isn't your fault. We are all toxic! We've become more toxic over 
generations due to this process of toxins being passed maternally down 
thru generations in addition to our persistent environmental exposure 
once we are in the world. The EWG (Environmental Working Group) 



continues studies where they find over 287 different chemicals in the 
cord blood of infants. Add this with our other environmental factors we 
deal with today and it is easy to understand why we are a population 
dealing with pandemics of mental health issues and health issues 
relating to toxicity 

So the question is, do you want healthy kids? Whether they are already 
born, being carried currently or planned to be conceived; you have to get 
these killer toxins out of us. 

How? You have to get into the parts of the body where these chemicals, 
metals and toxins are being sequestered and stored. The brain, central 
nervous system, tissues and fat of the body are the primary areas which 
have to be addressed. Until recently a truly effective method to safely 
and systemically remove these killers has not been available. 

Practitioners have done everything they could to try to find solutions to 
help you and your family but have come up short, as the methods 
weren't available. Until now, a recent advancement in pharmacology 
and chemistry has created a new "solution" derived from natures own 
creation for cleaning the environment. A patented proprietary process 
which turns a natural detoxifying crystal, a zeolite (clinoptilolite), into 
water-soluble Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments (HCF) thus creating a 
group of particles that are capable of binding toxins and are able to get 
into the deepest reaches of the body which need to be cleaned, your 
central nervous system, brain, fat and other cells and tissues. 

This invention does this passively with 100% safety as it has been 
proven safe by the FDA and given GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe] 
status as a food additive. It can't hurt you, your baby or your children. It 
can only help you. 

If you desire to have healthy kids I encourage you to step outside the 
standard thinking to change your life and the life of your loved ones. 
Make sure they end up better than you, not just like you!

Foc.es of addfossscsci the Autism 


This is not an attempt to debate the cause of Autism and the 
neurological issues which make up the Autism Spectrum as well as 
ADD and ADHD diagnoses. We can now accept that these issues 
are primarily caused by environmental toxicity The source of this 
toxicity which tips children into the Spectrum begins at day one, 
when a specific child reaches their tipping point depends on a 
multitude of factors, the most important being the mother. It is 
well proven by the Environmental Working Group that 
approximately 30% of the mercury in a mother is passed to her 
child via the placenta and thru breast milk, in addition 287 
additional toxins (that we can test for today). 

We are born poisoned. Some embryos become so toxic that they 
are miscarried. The rest are born with their specific body burden 
and then become victims of their environment. From our first 
breathe we are loaded with daily exposures to additional chemicals, 
heavy metals and environmental toxins which are known to cause 
neurological damage, cancer, death and a whole sort of other 




systemic issues. Then we add in our vaccine schedule with the 
preservatives of Thimerosal (mercury) and now aluminum 
derivatives in place of mercury Is there any question why Autism 
rates have exponentially increased in correlation to an increase in 
the vaccine schedule? I think not, either.

Focus on tho brain and contra! 
nervous; systen for datoKsfication 
to fine! tho ohsogos you doalro 


Since mercury is the worst neurotoxin known to man and one of 
the most deadly toxins known we can focus on this as the primary 
issue. Mercury is lipophilic, it loves fat and is stored in fat. Since 
your brain is derived of fat mercury loves to sequester in brain 
tissue as well as adipose and other areas of the body The question 
then becomes simple. If mercury is sequestered in the brain and 
Autism and all of the issues of the neurological system start in the 
brain and central nervous system why are we not focusing on the 
detoxification of this system? 

The answer has been simple, there we no simple, safe, effective and 
systemic methods that could address mercury where it is primarily 
stored. Until now This is why when you hear about the next great 
detox in the media it is focused on the gastrointestinal system, the 
kidney or liver. These are great but they don’t address the real 
source of the problem. 

For a decade now a volcanic mineral has been used for heavy metal 
detoxification in the gut. This mineral is a zeolite, clinoptilolite, 
which is formed from volcanic ash mixing in sea water and 
fossilizing to create a honey comb porous cage structure with a 
natural negative charge which acts like a sieve for toxins in the 
environment. This mineral is insoluble in water so ingestion of the 
powder or of a suspension of powder in water can provide great 
benefits to the gastrointestinal system as the mineral binds toxins 
in the system. 


This zeolite offers amazing benefits with a mineral that is GRAS 
(Generally Regarded As Safe) by the FDA but because of its 
insolubility it leaves the important parts of the left wanting. 
Recently a patented proprietary process has been introduced and 
scientifically proven to hydrolyze the zeolite. This process creates 
Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments that are pure watersoluble 
particles of the natural crystal structure which are small enough to 


permeate cell membrane and the blood brain barrier allowing the 
proven benefits of the zeolite to enter cells and the brain and 
central nervous system where these particles can passively bind 
mercury and other heavy metals and toxins and safely remove 
them. 

We can finally address the cause at its source. 

This process of hydrolysis is proven with the highest levels of 
pharmaceutical science. Liquid Chromatography Mass 
Spectroscopy analysis has proven the particles created are water 
soluble and range in size between 240 and 1,000 daltons. More 
than 10 times smaller than is allowable to cross a mitochondrial 
membrane. 

Initial clinical research has proven increases in electrical activity in 
the brain as well as improved memory and other biological 
functions from an increase in cell membrane vitality and efficiency 
to increased cellular energy and basal metabolic rate with 
reductions in inflammation and cellular fat. 

Most important is the passive nature of the solution. It is safe for 
all ages and is completely passive. A child in the spectrum can very 
easily add this protocol to their daily regimen without upsetting 
their routine. A parent can start as slow as they want and titrate 
up at their own pace based on the reaction of their own child 
without risk of negative responses. Your child might even start 
asking for their drops as they begin to notice changes in their body 
and biochemistry 

Addressing the symptoms seen in children in the spectrum by 
effecting the cause at the source can allow you to experience the 
results you’ve always dreamed of seeing in your child.

A Different Look at a Recognized issue of insulin Resistance 
and Potentiation: Unblock, the Receptor Sites 


Why woisid scmeons all of the 
sadden bsscoms insaiin 
rsWbtent? ?heh colb can't 
assimilate* the moisetiies. 


The body has a unique ability to regenerate, heal and adapt to its 
environment. That is until the environment becomes too 
burdensome for the body to adapt. Let us take a quick look at an 
issue that effects tens of millions of Americans and millions more 
beyond our borders: Diabetes. Be sure that you keep in mind that 
these thoughts and ideas are in no way designed to talk about 
treating or curing diabetes. In fact, once one is diagnosed with 
diabetes they will always be “diabetic” but there is always the 
opportunity to become subclinical. Whether a diagnosed diabetic 
can regulate their blood sugar via diet, exercise and lifestyle they 
are still diabetic. 

As a population we have focused on the issues diet, exercise and 
lifestyle to combat the symptoms of diabetes for decades, now we 
can talk about an additional approach to possibly look at one of 
the main causes of insulin resistance. Your cells have insulin 
binding sites just as they have binding sites for other hormones like 
testosterone and estrogen or nutrients like calcium, magnesium 




and potassium. It is well proven that heavy metals such as mercury 
cadmium, arsenic and lead amongst a long list of other 
environmental chemicals and toxins block different receptor sites 
of cells, some of these toxins block insulin receptor sites. 





j. oxter o,e.us Don't function well 


Let’s look at the symptoms of being toxic just briefly. First toxins 
build up in adipose tissue as well as other parts of the body, like the 
brain. Your brain uses fat to store toxins in order to keep them 
from damaging critical parts of the body as the body does not have 
the ability to effectively remove these toxins from the body. As 
you become more and more toxic you can add significantly more 
fat. And we all know that obesity has been linked to high risk of 
diabetes and now it is directly linked to significantly increased 
cancer risk. 


Makes you think right. Body stores toxins in fat, toxins are known 
to cause cancer and diabetes, fat people have highest cancer and 
diabetes risk. Hmmm. Are you then sick or just toxic? 

So what happens if you are able to detoxify your cells and tissue? 
This is the trillion dollar question. Instead of treating the 
symptoms of insulin resistance why not just remove what is 
blocking your cells from assimilating insulin. If you are able to get 
into the cells where these blockages are taking place and remove 
the cause of the blockage you free up the binding site available for 
insulin which in turns allows the cell to buffer insulin from the 
blood stream. The continued detoxification of cells allows 
improved assimilation of insulin which would decrease the amount 
of insulin and sugar in the blood stream which over time could 
cause AiC Levels to decrease and possibly lead an individual to 
becoming subclinical. 

When this process also cleans out the adipose tissue of stored 
toxins, fat can dissipate as it is no longer needed as a storage 
medium. The best part is knowing that this process goes beyond 
your cells but also into the brain and central nervous system where 
amazing changes can take place regarding your total systemic 
function.

Life is full of choices. We make many of them on a daily basis, 
some are small and don’t have much impact and others can change 
the course of our life. How you choose to approach wellness is one 
of the big choices. Do you choose to follow the allopathic route or 
the “alternative” approach? Let us take a look at both approaches 
and attempt to make an argument which option might be best to 
start with. 

I’m not anti-Pharma, anti-MDs or the medical establishment. 

They all have their purpose. 

My partner is an elite cardio thoracic surgeon and if I need surgery 
for anything pertaining to my cardiovascular system I want him in 
the room. I don’t need him to do an analysis of a back ache. It is 
not his area of expertise. This approach should be taken when 
looking at all aspects of your health and wellness. 

Why look to maintenance before looking for a solution to the 


cause. 




Symptom Based Th< 


y 



I think as a population we have become too dependent on the 
“doctor says” philosophy. Let us look at the model. Medical 
doctors are trained in pharmacology and the prescription of drugs 
or procedures to address symptoms of a patient. If you have a list 
of symptoms say drowsiness, lack of motivation, feelings of sadness 
and lack of libido as an example; your physician will look at those 
symptoms to give you a “diagnosis” and possibly give you a title. 
You’re depressed! Based on the diagnosis she can prescribe You a 
pharmaceutical to take to manage the symptoms. This is where 
managed care comes in. 

The goal of medicine today is not to cure your issue or even treat 
the cause, the focus is on symptom management. If you hurt, let’s 
mask the pain. You don’t sleep well or can’t get to sleep, let’s give 
you a drug to put you in a minor coma. Over time you may show 
other symptoms of “issues” where you need additional 
prescriptions to manage those symptoms. Sometimes you need 
prescriptions to manage side effects of the prescriptions you have 
been prescribed. This seems odd. This is not how you get well. It 
is how you check out, and unfortunately today millions and 
millions of Americans are part of this culture. Nothing wrong with 
it, it just seems odd. 


Simpls in philosophy, Cfeon up 
the coils sod tbs? body snd watch 
w hat h a p p o ns. 


Now let us look at the other side of the coin. With every symptom 
there is an underlying cause. It should stand to reason that if you 
remove the cause from the area of the body where the disruption 
is taking place then the symptoms would cease. No cause. No 
effect. 


Think of a group of children in a classroom. If you have one child 
who is acting out and causing disruptions, you simply remove the 
problem child and get back to business. The children who know 
how to behave will go back to acting properly once the cause of 
the disruption is removed. The body is no different. 

The problem to this point in time has been how to effectively find 
the problems in the body and remove them. Good thing we have a 
“solution” for that now. 



Back in the 1970s the World Health Organization stated the 
primary cause of chronic degenerative diseases were environmental 
toxins. Times haven’t changed. They have actually gotten worse. 
We are more toxic as a population (and I mean globally) than we 
have ever been. Hence rates of cancer, diabetes, alzheimer’s, heart 
disease and other health conditions are at their highest points in 
history and rising. 

We’re toxic! No arguments can be made. From day 1 you are 
poisoned, ''tour mother pushed mercury and other toxins in to you 
while you were in the womb and then through breast milk and 
then you got everything else we deal with. The Environmental 
Working Group has proven and continues to document that 30% 
of mercury in a mother is passed to her infant along with other 
chemicals, pollutants and toxins. Plus based on weight and size a 
baby is 8 times more toxic than its mother. 

So the question is, are you sick or just toxic? In actuality, you’re 
freakin' poisoned! 

Does it not stand to reason that it might make more sense to look 
into removing the toxins that are causing your symptoms before 
trying to treat the symptoms themselves? If you remove the toxins 
you just might start feeling better. 

If you don’t have symptoms yet, great. Do what you can to get the 
toxins out early enough and find out how amazing a truly healthy 
body can function. This is why I make the statement that I can’t 
get cancer. Not possible. My body works too well. 

If you have symptoms that concern you, try doing some work to 
clear out the cesspool that is your body. You might not need to 
take the drugs commonly prescribed for your symptoms. 

If you are already being “treated” for issues, try cleaning your body 
up. Watch the miracle that is the human body function when 
blockages and stressors are removed. You might find you may not 
need the drugs anymore or you can dramatically decrease what you 
need to maintain some semblance of balance. 

Don’t be afraid to try the “alternative” before going mainstream. 
You just might find vitality 




History 

Zeolites, specifically clinoptilolite, has a long 
documented history of use for the cleaning up 
environmental issues. The first recorded instances date 
back to Roman times when the Roman Empire used 
clinoptilolite to line the aqueducts to assure they did not 
die of lead poisoning from their water supply. 

Moving forward to more recent history this zeolite has 
proven usage for removal of toxins, chemicals and 
heavy metals from everything from kitty litter and water 
filters (your refrigerator probably has some clinoptilolite 
in its filter) to environmental cleanup of the worst 
nuclear disasters and environmental spills. 

The main point to understand is this; clinoptilolite is proven and 
recognized as the most effective natural method to bind heavy 
metals and environmental toxins and remove them from the 





FOW: 





environment. It is why they were created. A volcanic mineral 
with a natural negative charge and honeycomb structure that acts 
like natures sieve to bind toxins in the environment. The same 
volcanic eruptions that created the zeolite beds across the globe 
also spewed out tons of heavy metals like mercury, lead and 
aluminum amongst other toxins. Without a natural purification 
system our existence would have been minimized as the 
environment would have been too toxic. 

Human Consumption Introduction 



A little over 20 years ago the first powdered zeolite products 
came to the market. Micah Portney was the first person to 
introduce zeolite powders to the world for human consumption. 
These first two products were known as Esdifan and Destroxin 
(both still available today) both of which are micronized 
powders of clinoptilolite and are sold for their ability to bind 
toxins and water in the gut for use as anti-diarrheal products. 
Both work very well for just that; as when clinoptilolite is 
ground into a powder and consumed by capsule or powder it has 
an amazing ability to work within the gut to do what the zeolite 
does naturally, bind the bad stuff and remove it. 

Over the last 15 years or so there has been significant research 
done on the power of this zeolite to validate the efficacy of the 
mineral to bind everything from mercury, lead, aluminum and 
arsenic to cesium-137, strontium-90 and uranium-233 to viral 
particles and beyond. There is additional research published 
from research done in Croatia that showed that for some reason 
the mineral has an innate ability to up regulate (reactivate) tumor 
suppressor genes in abnormal cells when a powdered suspension 
(small amount of powder mixed in water) was injected directly 
into growths of abnormal cells in rats. There are currently over 
300 published clinical studies on clinoptilolite on pubmed.gov 
that validate this minerals unique properties. 


10 years ago a new industry was created with the first 
introduction of a zeolite suspension. A suspension in terms of 
chemistry is NOT a liquid. Think of amino acids or Kool Aid 
where you can mix some powder in water and it appears to go 
into solution and become water but if you add enough you see it 
begin to settle on the bottom of the glass. These are 



suspensions. Insoluble particles mixed in water to make them 
easier to ingest. 

This is where claims and facts start to get a little 
mixed up. Remember clinoptilolite and other 
zeolites are rocks, crystals formed from ash and 
lava mixing in sea water. If you are to grind up 
a rock and mix a little bit in water given that the 
rock is a solid and is not water soluble you can 
only create a suspension. This also means that 
this suspension of a solid could not cross a 
cellular membrane of a health gastrointestinal tract. Some of the 
particles get into the blood stream via leaky gut issues which 
allows zeolite particles that should not typically cross the 
membrane of the GI tract to get into the blood stream before 
being flushed out of the body via the kidneys in a few hours. 

This process has great benefit by helping to briefly remove some 
toxins from the blood stream. 

These suspensions have primarily been sold through direct sales 
or direct to consumer websites. They have had a great run in 
the market place, having sold hundreds of millions of dollars of 
product over the last 10 years. But this distribution model has 
led to distributors being misinformed by companies to sell a 
story that is not true or factual. This ends now because of a new 
advancement in the world of zeolite science. A new proprietary 
patented process that has never been done before, even at the 
highest levels of research for environmental cleanup. 

Researchers at one of the top nuclear proliferation research 
laboratories have been attempting to hydrolyze clinoptilolite for 
over 20 years. Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction that can be 
created to turn a solid into a liquid. Up until about 2 years ago a 
process to do this had never been discovered. And then very 
quietly the World changed when a world renowned physician 
who was a senior research fellow at one of the top cardio- 
thoracic surgery and research institutions in the world was asked 
to look at one of the suspensions of zeolite to improve the 
manufacturing process. He had no history with zeolites, just a 
PharmD, MD, PhD, FETCS and two international awards for 
advancements in cardio thoracic technology and coronary artery 



flow with an innate understanding of chemistry due to his first 
doctorate being in Pharmacology. 

Knowing that a suspension provided no systemic value to the 
body. He took on a challenge to create something that could be 
different. He invented and validated the first process to 
hydrolyze clinoptilolite. For the last 18 months this process has 
been tested and validated to make sure that the product that is 
being created is actually a liquid and does have what are called 
Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments (HCF). The exciting news 
is that this is science FACT! Proven with independent lab 
analysis with pharmaceutical research laboratories and by 
analysis of leaders in the fields of environmental cleanup as well 
as systemic detoxification in humans and animals. 

“The LC-MS analysis of the HCFCon yielded a range of 
molecular weights between 235 - 620 Daltons. The exact mass 
for each of the observed peaks and the difference between 
adjacent peaks was used to determine the presence of sodium 
ions with indication of at least one sodium ion associated with 
each of the various molecular weight species.” 

What does this mean? The analysis proves that the new product 
is a liquid and has Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments that 
make up the SOLUTION that are small enough to cross cellular 
membranes as well as sub cellular membranes and the blood 
brain barrier. For the first time in history, the mineral that is 
proven to be the best method for binding and removing 
environmental toxins is actually bio-available. 

Victor Hugo stated “Nothing is stronger than an idea whose time 
has come.” 

This is the premise for this entire conversation. We live in a 
toxic world. Our population is becoming ever increasingly more 
sick and polluted year over year. Rates of cancer, diabetes, 
obesity, autism, alzheimer’s and other degenerative issues are 
increasing at alarming rates due to how toxic we have become. 

An amazing opportunity exists to those who can solve the 
problem.

health, or both. 



Environmentalism 






Change Your Mind 


People have become passionate about global warming and 
environmental issues today and how the actions of humanity are having 
an influence on the environment but most people refuse to look at the 
real environmental issues that are plaguing humanity; the issue of 
internal environmental toxicity. Our population is more poisoned today 
than at any other point in human history. If we don't address this issue 
our external environment doesn't matter. 

Governments, advocates, the media and consumers love to talk 
about issues and problems but the topic of solutions is fleeting because 
it is so easy to pray on fear. Let's change the approach. With creation of 
fear in a human two responses become possible fight or flight. So let's 
actually fight what is killing us instead of becoming sicker and sicker with 
less energy, more fat and increased mental illness and chronic diseases. 

If your body is poisoned with heavy metals and environmental 
toxins, which it is, any work you do to help the global environment is 
really wasted because you won't be able to fully enjoy what you are 
working to preserve due to the damage of the toxins and chemicals that 
are destroying your bodies ability to function. Take mercury for example 
which ever person alive has excessive levels of, most are sub-clinical but 
have symptomology that isn't correlated. What are symptoms of mercury 
toxicity? Just about every issue humans deal with today that is not a true 



genetic disorder like Sickle Cell trait and Down's Syndrome. Don't 
believe me? Google it! 

Mercury is proven to damage 8 systems of the body: 

Endocrine Immune Cardiovascular Neurological 

Respiratory Reproductive Psychological Central Nervous 

It is a great thing that there are only 8 major systems that are 
damaged by mercury alone but the major problem is that there are no 
other systems to disrupt or damage. And to think that even today the 
Environmental Working Group finds over 287 known toxins in the cord 
blood of infants; over 1 80 of those toxins are known carcinogens (THEY 
CAUSE CANCER) and over 200 are known neurotoxins. What do you 
think our problem is? 

We know what our issues are, we know where they are. Now we 
know howto get them out. With the Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragment 
technology which makes natures ideal detoxification mineral water- 
soluble and bioavailable we can now remove these toxins from inside the 
brain and central nervous system as well as the fat, tissue and cells of 
your body. 

Become a true environmentalist and help others clean up 
themselves and their friends and family.

systemically and are not absorbed by the 
body. Quality varies significantly. 

Bioavailability and cage 
structure are critical for 
effectiveness. 


LEADING DETOXIFICATION INGREDIENTS 














Chtorella can. also absorb toxins from the intestines. Because of its ability to bind to heavy metals and other toxins, it makes it a 
good partner to cilantro. 


Cilantro can help remove heavy metals; however it tends to carry these metals to another part of the body. It should be used with 
other products that will capture heavy metals and remove them, from the body. 

Milk Thistle supports the liver functions and prevents toxins from building up in the liver. It helps support liver health and heavy' 
metal removal. Its action is primarily observed in the liver. 

Vitamin C has a long history of use in immune system support. Vitamin C helps boost the body’s production of glutathione. It 
also helps remove free radicals from the body. 

Vitamin E works best in removing lead. It works well with Vitamin C. It helps reduce the stress caused by toxins in the body. 
Some concerns exist regarding high dosages of Vitamin E. 

Magnesium supports detoxification and the production of energy process (as ATP), which provides cells with the energy they 
require for pumping out toxins before, during, and after they accumulate. 

Modified Citrus Pectin is found in apples and fruits. It binds heavy metals and some free radicals. It has limited use in 
detoxification. 

Glutathione is the body’s natural detoxification agent. Glutathione helps to remove heavy metals such as cadmium, iron and 
mercury. It is very difficult to supplement with Glutathione because the human body does not absorb it easily. 

NAC is art amino acid, which can bind heavy metals and stimulates the body’s natural removal systems, NAC is used to treat 
acetaminophen over dose. It is used with DMPS to support heavy metal removal 


EDTA is effective in removing heavy metals from the blood, it is the standard, FDA-approved treatment: for lead, mercury, 
aluminum and cadmium poisoning. EDTA may deplete important vitamins and minerals, so daily multivitamin supplementation 
is required 

BMPS is a drag developed, in. Europe and is widely used to lower heavy' metal toxin, levels. It is administrated orally by 
physician. Side effects are common and its use must be monitored. 

BMSA is used for lead poisoning in children. It is used by some physicians prior to having mercury' amalgams removed. This 
requires physician, monitoring due to potential side effects. 

Clinoptilolite Zeolite was created millennia ago from the combination of volcanic ash and blue green algae, Clinoptilolite is the 
variety of zeolite most associated with detoxification. It is sold as a powder or liquid, but most forms are not bioavailable. It is 
widely used in environmental toxin removal. It is difficult to get it to work in the body. 

Humic & Fulvic Acid are naturally occurring acids used with other detoxification systems. Humic acid is known for immune 
support. Fulvic acid is known for detoxification and energy support. Neither has undergone extensive safety or performance 
studies. 

Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments provide a different concept in detoxification via oral chelation. It is a patented hydrolyzed 
(water-soluble) zeolite crystalline fragment and 100% bioavailable which works at the subcellular and mitochondrial level. Pre- 
clinical studies have demonstrated HCF safety and efficacy. It creates a foundation for natural health improvement by 
systemically removing the recognized cause of approximately 90% of all chronic diseases and supporting the body’s natural 
detoxification process.

CANCER IS NOT A DISEASE. The proliferation of abnormal cells 
which is diagnosed as cancer is an alarm in your body letting you 
know that your immune system isn't working and you are completely 
poisoned and if left unaddressed your system will not be able to 
continue functioning. Every second you breathe cells somewhere in 
your body become damaged and become abnormal. Problems arise 
when your immune system is compromised and these cells can not be 
dealt with. 

In a healthy functioning biological system your immune system, 
specifically a few genes, naturally recognizes this abnonnality and 
through a process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the cell 
terminates itself. When this natural process does not happen the 
opportunity for these cells to metastasize is created. Hie key point of 
this process is the body itself has a regulation mechanism to destroy 
the proliferation of abnormal cells if the system itself is functioning 
“normally”. 

The National Cancer Institute supports this theory as well as major 
medical schools all over the world. With many articles and research 
reports stating that the primary cause of cancer is environmental in 
nature in most instances, upwards of 90% in most perspectives. I 
would also argue that in the other 10% of cancer cases where the topic 


of a genetic predisposition to cancer is discussed, the issue may not 
“genetic” but familial. If you weren't poisoned in the womb your 
immune system and cells would have been properly functioning as we 
are supposed to be created. 

The damaging level of toxicity creating the environment for your 
immune system to “short circuit” can be derived from toxins that were 
passed from your mother while in the womb and via breast milk in 
addition to the accumulation of toxic metals and other environmental 
toxins from your environment as you live, breathe, eat and exist. It is 
absolutely impossible to not have some level of heavy metal and 
environmental toxin accumulation in your body from Day One. No 
matter when Day One is, at conception or at birth.

A refusal to address the cause of the problem (cancer in the case of 
this argument) will lead to traumatic results in time, no matter how 
much you “treat” the symptoms. You cant cure a symptom. Hence 
the fight against cancer will never be won. Cancer isn’t the issue, the 
causes of cancer and why our population has become so cancer ridden 
is the issue. 




Cure The Cause! 




How can I make the statement that I can't get cancer? I have been 
fortunate enough to gamer knowledge earlier than most, accept it and 
act on it. Now I have the responsibility to share this information. Here 
is the basic reasoning behind my claims. If you don't possess the cause 
of an issue you'll never show symptoms. Or if you have symptoms of 
being toxic, and you remove the cause of the problem the body will 
heal and you will no longer have symptoms. Some might say you 
become sub-clinical. This is not curing a disease! It is simple 
biochemistry. Cause and Effect. Remove the Cause - No Effect! 

The question then is how do you effectively remove the cause of 
cancer and what the World Health Organization and National Cancer 
Institute have proven is the cause of over 90% of all chronic disease 
and cancer. The “solution” is quite simple really when you use the 
correct protocol. 


Ever heard of zeolites? Clinoptilolite has been used since Roman 
times for its ability to remove heavy metals and toxins from the 
environment. Clinoptilolite has GRAS status (Generally Regarded as 
Safe) with the FDA and has been used globally for the last 60 years 
for everything from kitty litter, animal feed, environmental 
remediation in areas like Fukushima, Chernobyl and 3 Mile Island as 
well as food supplements. What makes this volcanically fonned 
crystalline honeycomb stmctured crystal unique is tire naturally 
occurring cage structure which acts to bind heavy metals and other 
environmental toxins as well as viral particles and other toxins found 
in the environment. The mineral is insoluble in water making it ideal 
for environmental remediation. 




Clinoptilolite has been used as a dietary aid for over 20 years. These 
zeolite powders are very beneficial in the gastrointestinal system of 
humans and animals but the insolubility does not allow the mineral to 
work throughout the body no matter how much you grind up the 
powder due to the insolubility of the crystal. 

When it comes to cancer remediation and prevention some significant 
research has been published regarding the ability of clinoptilolite to 
up-regulate tumor suppressor genes, P21, P27 and P53 in abnormal 
cells. Initial research from Croatia validated the minerals efficacy for 
abnormal (cancer) cell destruction. (Anticancer Research 23: 
1589-1596 (2003)) What has been proven is the zeolite allows the 
natural immune function of the abnormal cell to become active which 
allows the cell to go through apoptosis (cell death) as it should have 
initially when it became damaged. 

The question was how can you make an insoluble mineral bio- 
available so as to allow the mineral to work throughout the body and 
unleash this amazing proven ability. 

The process to turn insoluble clinoptilolite into a water soluble particle 
came after having a brilliant physician be introduced to the concept of 
a “liquid zeolite.” For the past 9 years companies have been selling 
products claiming to be “liquid” zeolites. All of these products are 
suspensions of a micronized zeolite powder. Remember that 
clinoptilolite is insoluble in water no matter how fine you grind the 
crystal. Remember chemistry class? You cannot make a “liquid” out of 
a solid. You might be able to create a suspension but never a solution. 
Think of Kool-Aid if you mix too many packets in a small glass of 
water. You have solids left as they won't suspend. These micronized 
zeolite powder suspensions are the same as Kool-Aid Just really 
expensive with some really great abilities to bind toxins in your GI 
tract. 

Because of the mechanism of action of clinoptilolite, many users of 
these powdered products have had life changing results, but their 
overall opportunity for a completely mind blowing experience was not 
available as the products they use have lacked the ability to cross the 
cellular membrane or cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and work 
throughout the body where these deadly toxins are stored and 
sequestered and cause the most damage to your body. If you can't get 
inside your cells, your brain and central nervous system and fat and 
other tissue you can never get to the root of the problem. 

To solve the issue of solubility a process of hydrolysis was created 
which breaks down the structure of the zeolite to create Hydrolyzed 
Clinoptilolite Fragments (HCF) which are water-soluble in solution 
and 100% bio-available. The HCF particles maintain the structure and 
ability of the clinoptilolite it is derived from. Urey are no longer a 
zeolite but a new derived particle from the original zeolite. 

The water solubility of the Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments gives 
the clinoptilolite derived particles the ability to cross the mucus 




Powdsrs are good f»? yoar gut-

you hove to have a product that

membrane in the mouth as well as the gastrointestinal wall in the gut 
allowing the particles to circulate throughout the bloodstream and 
enter cells and tissue and cross the blood-brain barrier. The ability to 
work throughout the body differentiates the patented product from any 
other zeolite product on the market. No other product can do what this 
patented formula does because of the size and solubility. 

HCF is the only liquid proven to work systemically throughout the 
entire body and is enhanced with the inclusion of a Vitamin C 
molecule which is attached to the cage structure of the water soluble 
zeolite particles. This addition of the Vitamin C molecule increases the 
ability of the HCF particles to cross the cellular membrane as every 
cell membrane in the body has vitamin C receptor sites. Essentially a 
skeleton key is added to every HCF particle which allows it to easily 
pass through cells and the BBB. 

Does this amazing invention cure cancer? Can it be used to treat 
cancer? NO! The product is not designed to treat or cure cancer or 
any other disease. Stating that it does is a misrepresentation of its 
function, impact, a distortion of acceptable communication and a legal 
endangerment to the individual making such medical claims. 

What the product does do is passively remove the toxins and 
chemicals commonly known to contribute to this issue and to the 
majority of other chronic health conditions we face today. Thus 
allowing the body to effectively function. 

Supporting the improvement of cellular membranes, cellular energy 
and cellular metabolism, HCF allows the body to find homeostasis and 
heal itself. We live in a toxic environment where sick is the new 
“normal” What's your issue? 

Life creates its own necessities and as every need presents its own 
solution you just have to know how to find it or create it. 

Continual and prolonged use of HCF is your solution to a more 
effective vitalized body. Because of my prolonged use of this amazing 
technology I can't get cancer, and you can too. Make the simple to 
choice to feel as good as I do on a daily basis. You'll love it! 









Zeolite Detoxification 

Powder, Suspension, Hydrolyzed Fragments and You 


Clayton Thomas 


A solid cannot be s liquid,, a

suspension is a very smell 
amount of dirt In water. 


Nature consistently provides a solution to a problem if one does 
the work to look for it. When it comes to the removal of 
environmental toxins and heavy metals a class of volcanic minerals 
has been proven to eliminate toxins better than any other method. 
Zeolites are natures detoxifier. A mineral created by volcanic acid 
mixing with sea water and fossilizing on the sea floor possessing a 
porous honeycomb cage structure which naturally binds toxins. 
Notably used by the Romans to line the aqueducts, zeolites have 
been used for air, water, soil, sewage and environmental 
remediation for decades. Your refrigerator water filter probably 
has zeolites in it. 

In the last decade the use of zeolites for internal benefits has 
become more prominent with the use of micronized powders and 
micronized powder water suspensions and now a Hydrolyzed 
Clinoptilolite Fragment technology. Which should you use and for 
what should they be used for?

What is the difference between powders and powdered 
suspension? The amount of zeolite you get with each dose and the 
amount of money you pay for the product. A powder is a powder 
whether it is in water or not. Both are insoluble and unable to be 
absorbed in the body so they both provide benefits in the gut and 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Since both products work in the same 
part of the body and do the same thing it would make sense to use 
the product with the lowest cost and the greatest amount of 
product. This makes the zeolite powders the best option if you are 
looking to detoxify your GI tract. 

Detoxification of your GI tract and gut is only the tip of the 
iceberg for total wellness in order to get well and function 
optimally you have to detoxify your entire body. 

Systemic Zeolite Detoxification 

Heavy metals like mercury and aluminum are neurotoxins and 
lipophilic, meaning they prefer to be stored in fats and in the brain 
and central nervous system. Other chemicals and toxins end up 
everywhere in the body Whether it is lead and strontium 90 in 
your bones, cesium 137 in our heart, and organophosphates 
terrorizing your liver and the list goes on. In 1974 the World 
Health Organization had stated that approximately 84% of all 
chronic diseases are created by environmental toxins. This number 
hasn’t gone down over the last 40 years and the issues are not 
focused on the gut so why do we not focus our efforts of 
detoxification on the areas where these toxins do the most 
damage? The easy answer is that we have not had a simple, safe, 
effective and cost effective ability to do what we’ve really needed. 


This ability took a deep understanding of chemistry and 
pharmaceutical science to create a process of hydrolysis which 
breaks down the structure of the zeolite mineral into small 
Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragments that are watersoluble and 
capable of crossing cell membranes. This includes the GI tract, 
adipose and tissue cells as well as the blood brain barrier/ central 
nervous system and mitochondrial walls allowing these amazing 
particles to get into the most important parts of the body where 
these killer toxins are sequestered to bind these toxins and allow 
them to be secreted passively. 



This process of hydrolysis is proven scientifically with 
pharmaceutical level testing such as Liquid Chromatography Mass 
Spectroscopy analysis and independent research by leading 
physicians in the field of heavy metal detoxification. The ability to 
detoxify the body has changed and become very simple. A few 
drops two to three times daily and you are on your way 

If systemic detoxification is your desire and you understand the 
power of zeolites and their ability to bind and remove heavy 
metals, environmental toxins and other chemicals your best option 
is to find the only Hydrolyzed Clinoptilolite Fragment (HCF) 
technology on the market. 



Sorry It Can't 


My Zeolite Product Does This Too 

Clayton Thomas, JAG 

It's truth time. This should be one piece that sparks some great conversations for you as there are 
thousands of people and about 10 other products on the market that “claim” to be “liquid zeolites.” 

This should provide some clarity for you. 

First zeolites, specifically clinoptilolite which is the best of the category for detoxification, are a 
crystalline mineral structure that are insoluble in water. Meaning the mineral in its natural form no 
matter the size of the particle is NOT ABLE TO BECOME A LIQUID! This is why clinoptilolite is 
used so heavily for environmental cleanup and industrial use as well as for use in water filters, air 
filters, kitty litter, digestive aids, anti -diarrheal products, other food additives among other uses. 

500,000 tons of clinoptilolite powder were dropped over Chernobyl after the meltdown and untold tons 
have been used in the ocean, the soil and in the reactor pools of Fukushima as well as 3 Mile Island and 
nuclear reactor areas like Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. You can mix the slurry of 
zeolite powder in water and it will never go into solution. It will suspend for a time but never go into 
solution to become water soluble. This is the most crucial difference between the Hydrolyzed Crystal 
Fragment technology you have and every other zeolite product on the market. Your competition is 
either a cheap powder in a container or a cheap micronized powder suspended in water and then sold in 
miniscule amounts at high prices to make people money. 

The Hydrolyzed Crystal Fragment technology actually starts where all of our competition finishes. We 
are able to take a zeolite either in rock or powder form and hydrolyze the crystal meaning our 
proprietary patent pending process breaks down the mineral into nano sized crystalline fragments that 
become water soluble and are also small enough and have molecular weights small enough to pass any 
cell membrane in your body, especially the blood brain barrier and central nervous system. At this 
point the game is over. But let's talk a little extra science to really differentiate your position. 

The micronized powder suspensions (“liquid zeolites” as they claim) have a claimed molecular size of 
3-5 microns. This is fairly small but size is only a small part of the equation. Without being water 
soluble the molecule can never cross a membrane wall. That is the gastrointestinal wall or other 
cellular membranes. Sometimes if an individual has a “leaky gut” due to GI toxicity some particles 
will get into the blood stream where they are the removed via the kidneys and urinated out. These 
particles are not bio-available (cannot work systemically and cross the cellular membranes) hence they 
have a recognized half-life (active time in the body) of about 4-6 hours. These products have some 
benefit but a simple cost/benefit and value analysis will have you reaching for the real proven 
technology. 

Now for the fun part. Our Hydrolyzed Crystal Fragments have an average size of 50 nanometers or .05 
microns (yeah you read that right .05 microns). 100 times smaller than our competition. Because of 
our focus on creating the best product in the industry and using pharmaceutical level testing methods 
we have completed Gas Chromatograph Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer analysis of our 
Hydrolyzed Crystal Fragments to understand the molecular weight, quantity and type of molecules we 
create. There are five different molecules created in our hydrolysis process that range in molecular 
weight from 240 to 1,000 daltons. The 1,000 daltons size is ten times smaller than the maximum size 
allowed to cross a cellular membrane. We have particles that are able to not just get into the cell but 
get into the mitochondria and citronella of the cells to detoxify your body at a level that has never 
before been achieved. 



Did I mention the Vitamin C we add to the Hydrolyzed Crystal Fragment structure to increase 
permeability across cell membranes? No. Each of the five particles we created have either one, two or 
three NA+ (sodium) binding sites as part of the structure. We add L- Ascorbic acid (Non-GMO 
organically sourced Vitamin C) in a final step of the process to bind the Vitamin C to the sodium 
binding sites. Because every cellular membrane in your body has Vitamin C receptor sites (Linus 
Pauling won a Nobel Prize for his research in this area) this combination of Vitamin C on the structure 
acts as a master key to provide easy access in and out of cells and across the blood brain barrier. 

You now have a scientifically proven zeolite technology that incorporates Nobel Prize winning research 
to create a product that will safely, simply and systemically address the issues of aging and systemic 
toxicity at a level that no other product or professional can claim to address. 

The end game is what you have isn't a zeolite anymore but a patented hydrolyzed crystalline fragment 
technology that is a derivative of the zeolite that everyone else sells as the best product available. We 
took what was created by nature and perfected it with real and amazing science. 

The opportunity to have a technology with no competition that addresses the issues that every person 
on the planet can benefit from and most want is beyond compare. 

Companies that create solutions to massive problems with no competition have a tendency to make 
billions of dollars when the “solution” is brought to the market. 

ENJOY THE RIDE!

CONSTITUENT INQUIRY: Dear Gov. Snyder: 

I am listening right now to the head of the MDEQ, Dan Wyant, shuck and jive in response to Cynthia 
Canty's questions regarding the MDEQ's performance concerning Flint's water. 

I am livid. 

VaTech's analysis demonstrated that my home's water supply has unacceptably high levels of lead. I have 
two grandsons who live in the city, and Freeman is our neighborhood elementary school. 

You and your government have failed me and mine. You appointed an emergency manager, took over my 
city and negated my representatives. Under the Detroit emergency manager, the Detroit water system 
threatened to raise our water rates to an unacceptable level. To save money your emergency manager 
decided to switch us to river water without implementing essential and required treatments, and your DEQ 
failed in its oversight responsibility to ensure that we have received the safe water that we have (dearly!) 
paid for. Instead, we've received (expensive) poison. 

And now Mr. Wyant dodges and weaves in response to Ms. Canty's (rather excellent and well-researched) 
questions. He repeatedly said, in essence, 'Well, there are experts who say all sorts of stuff", and avoids 
answering her very clear yes/no questions. 

It is clear that his department demonstrated incompetence in regard to Flint's water. This was not rocket 
science: It was chemistry, legal requirements, and keeping public health in mind. Developments have 
demonstrated that he, or people who are responsible to him, were incompetent, fraudulent or both. 

You cannot rely upon him for either objective advice or expertise. You owe it to us and yourself to fire him 
without delay (and then see who else in MDEQ needs to be set at liberty to seek other work :-) ).

Dear Ms. Stoken, 

Thank you for taking the time to send me this information. 

Nothing that you have told me changes the essential facts that are so disturbing: 

1. This was a man-made disaster for which Governor Rick Snyder and people who report directly to him are 
responsible. 

2. The people of Flint, Michigan, have been poisoned as a result of the decision to switched from a safe water 
source to a contaminated water source. Irreversible damage has been done. 

It is my opinion, as an American citizen who believes in the democratic process and in governmental 
responsibility, that the governor and those who were involved in this decision have been criminally negligent, 
and should face serious legal consequences for this gross incompetence. 

Sincerely,

Hello Laura, 

Thank you for your response. I find it curious that you make no mention of 

1) the early warnings from citizens of Flint 

2) the denial and lack of response by the Governor to those warnings 

3) the timing of the shutting off of water from Detroit and the subsequent removal of the actual pipe 

4) the lack of prior studies by his (your) office to determine whether the existing pipes and fixtures were near 
adequate to handle the change in water source 

and of course 

5) the actions of the appointed city manager that put all this in motion... 

And for what; to save money? The fact that your response only references hand picked statistics and make 
absolutely no mention of the family's that have suffered and others that will down the road is astonishing and 
criminal. 

Let's try this again...

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 


As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water testing data 
from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman 
Elementary School. 


i 



Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, 
rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools and other 
buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. “Problems with lead 
exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families 
in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty-two outlets did 
not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing 
immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead 
levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The 
school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The 
sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would 
drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start 
work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels 
were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. “Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has 
offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every 
sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean 
drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was 
conducted, visit www.mjchigan.gov/flintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be 
available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community 
Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should 
contact George Krisztian at knsztiang@michigan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free 
water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples 
analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead 
results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or 
in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners 
and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do 
is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable information for families.”

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The 
assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or 
food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and 
fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, followed by a 30-second 
flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples 
provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well 
as its connecting plumbing. 

On Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 
1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep 
in the building’s plumbing.

Freeman Elementary water testing shows lead 
exposure limited to fixtures 

Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint 

As part of Gov. Rick Snyder’s action plan for Flint drinking water, the DEQ today released water 
testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling 
results from Freeman Elementary School. 

Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even 
individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues. 

“The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes, businesses, schools 
and other buildings in Flint,” said George Krisztian, the DEQ’s Flint Action Plan Coordinator. 
“Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing 
fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the 
state.” 

Freeman Elementary testing results 

At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each. Twenty- 
two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high 
results. 

Those nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or 
plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for 
several minutes, lead levels fell significantly, in some cases to non-detectable levels. 

Additional testing designed to look deep into the school’s plumbing did not suggest larger, 
systemic issues. 

Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and 
fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized 
flushing regimen. The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap, a 3- to 4-minute flushing 
period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure. 

For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern. 

“The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, 
so we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related 



components where high lead levels were detected,” FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said. 
“Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the 
water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our 
students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all 
stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have 
access to safe, clean drinking water.” 

For Freeman Elementary’s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling 
was conducted, visit www.michiqan.gov/flintwater . 

The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will 
soon be available on the DEQ’s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the 
Flint Community Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools 
and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michiqan.gov . 

Homeowner and other customer-requested testing results 

Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took 
advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar, localized results. More than 75 
percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and 
more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less. 

This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead 
service lines or in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make 
it difficult for homeowners and businesses to predict their lead exposure. 

“Since it’s not easy to predict if an individual home’s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all 
residents can do is get their water tested,” Krisztian said. “It’s a free test that provides valuable 
information for families.” 

Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1 , 
or by emailing flintwater@citvofflint.com . 

For more information about water samples received through the state’s free testing program, 
visit www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 

How school sampling was conducted 

To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and 
Regulatory Affairs began on Oct. 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain 
a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of 
plumbing materials are used. The assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the 
school that provide water for drinking, cooking and/or food preparation. 

On Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified 
faucets and fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet, 
followed by a 30-second flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then 
the fourth sample. These samples provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or 
around each specific faucet and fountain as well as its connecting plumbing. 



On Oct. 31 , the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 1 0 each from three sites in the 
school. These 1 -liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the 
impact of any lead sources deep in the building’s plumbing.

In the fall of 20 1 1 , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency 
in the City of Flint and appointed an emergency manager to take control of the City’s

Emergency Manager has “broad powers” to “rectify the financial emergency and to assure 
fiscal accountability of the local government.” 4 

While under control of the Emergency Manager, the City faced decisions about the 
future of its drinking-water supply. For fifty years, the City had purchased drinking water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit), which sources water from 
Lake Efuron. 5 In response to rising water rates charged by Detroit, in March 2013, the City 
Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a newly formed municipal 
water supply system. The KWA was planning to build a pipeline to distribute water directly 
from Lake Huron to mid-Michigan communities, including Genesee County, where Flint is 
located. 6 The City Council’s vote did not become effective until several weeks later, after 
both the Emergency Manager and State Treasurer approved the decision. 7 

The City’s contract with Detroit was set to expire in April 2014, at least eighteen 
months before the KWA pipeline was scheduled to be completed. 8 Faced with a year-and-a- 
half gap in the City’s water supply, the Emergency Manager declined to negotiate a short- 
term contract with Detroit and decided instead to use the Flint River as a primary drinking- 
water source. 9 The City had previously explored — and rejected — the Flint River as a 
primary drinking-water source. This is because the Flint Water Treatment Plant would have 
required fifty million dollars in upgrades to treat the river water and “produce finished water 
in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water regulations.” 10

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule, Flint’s water system 
could not use the Flint River as a water source without first obtaining approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The Lead and Copper Rule 
required MDEQ to approve both the City’s proposed addition of a new water source (the 
Flint River) and the long-term change in water treatment (from treatment through Detroit’s 
water plant to treatment at the Flint Water Treatment Plant). 11 In April 2014, MDEQ 
approved the switch to river water. 12 The City immediately began pumping Flint River 
water through the City’s distribution pipes and into residents’ taps. 

B. Dangerous lead contamination results from the City's switch to river water 

In the twenty months following the switch in water sources, residents’ drinking water 
has been at times cloudy, discolored, and foul-smelling. 13 Residents reported that they have 
experienced hair loss, skin rashes, and vomiting after drinking the water. 14 In the summer of 
2014, the City was forced to issue several boil-water notices after tap water tested positive 
for total coliform bacteria. 15 The City’s subsequent treatment of the water to kill disease- 
carrying pathogens resulted in elevated levels of total trihalo methanes, a disinfection 
byproduct that can cause serious health problems, including an increased risk of cancer. 16

Because Flint River water is also highly corrosive, dangerous amounts of lead began 
to leach out of pipes and into the City’s drinking water. 17 Lead in drinking water occurs 
primarily from corrosion of pipes and other plumbing materials that contain lead or lead 
solder. 18 The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to manage lead levels by 
controlling corrosion, which is often accomplished by adding corrosion-inhibiting 
chemicals. 19 Water systems must implement and maintain an “optimal” corrosion-control 
treatment program that “minimizes the lead . . . concentrations at users’ taps.” 20 

Flint did not consider how to control the corrosivity of the river water before 
switching water sources, nor did MDEQ require the City to implement any corrosion- 
control measures. Rather, beginning in April 2014, the City did not use any form of 
treatment to control corrosion. 21 The City waited until after its residents were drinking the 
river water to assess whether it posed a risk of increased lead exposure. MDEQ endorsed 
this approach. In June 2014, Flint’s water system initiated the first of two six-month 
monitoring periods to test tap water for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule; the second 
six-month period ran from January to June 2015. 22 During these monitoring periods, the 
water system used flawed testing methods that appear to have been designed to underreport 
the lead content of residents’ drinking water. 23

Flint’s monitoring data showed that some residents’ water contained lead at 
concentrations above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion (ppb). 24 These high 
lead levels put residents at risk of abroad array of serious, irreversible health effects, 
including cognitive impairment, kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. 25 When the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) learned of these high lead sampling results in 
February 2015, it notified MDEQ officials that the sampling results raised significant 
concerns about corrosion from lead pipes in Flint’s distribution system. 26 Nonetheless, 
throughout the monitoring periods, the City and MDEQ maintained that these high lead 
levels were isolated and that the data, taken together, demonstrated Flint’s compliance with 
the Lead and Copper Rule. 27 

C. Community advocacy and independent testing prompt long past due 
response from City and State officials 

As the City concluded its second six-month round of sampling in July 2015, and 
notified some Flint residents of elevated lead levels in their tap water, the community 
became increasingly concerned. A small coalition of local groups, including Water You 
Fighting For and Concerned Pastors for Social Action, began working with researchers at 
Virginia Tech to conduct their own lead sampling of Flint’s water. The Virginia Tech 
scientists found that ten percent of the more than 250 samples collected from Flint 
residences had lead levels of 25 ppb or more, well above the federal action level for lead. 28 
Several samples exceeded 100 ppb, and one sample exceeded 1000 ppb. 29 Though aware of

Result Certificate for Community Water Supply (Aug. 20, 2015) (showing six samples with lead

the Virginia Tech sampling results, MDEQ officials continued to insist that Flint’s water 
was safe to drink. 30 

In September 2015, a medical study conducted by a local pediatrician confirmed the 
kinds of adverse health impacts that residents had voiced concern about for months: the rate 
of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels had nearly doubled since the City changed 
its drinking-water source. 31 State officials and the Governor reacted by “downplaying] and 
in some cases attempting] to discredit” the pediatrician’s findings, and dismissing citizen 
concerns as “near-hysteri[cal].” 32 

Subsequent testing by MDEQ revealed that at least four schools in Flint had lead 
levels in their drinking water above the federal action level. 33 At Freeman Elementary 
School, water tested had lead levels over 100 ppb, more than six times the federal action 
level. 34 This increase in lead exposure is particularly dangerous in Flint, a community where 
residents are already at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels and lead poisoning. 
Michigan ranks fifth worst in the country for harmful exposures to lead. 35 Tow income is a 
risk factor for lead poisoning, and more than a third of families in Flint live below the 
poverty level, three times the national average. 36 Children in Flint also face high risk of lead

exposure from lead-paint dust, as nearly ninety percent of Flint’s housing stock was built 
before 1978 (when the federal ban on high-lead paint went into effect). 37 

Finally, in late September 2015, the City abandoned its assertions that Flint’s 
drinking water was safe. Nearly seven months after the City first saw dangerously high 
levels of lead in some residents’ water, Flint issued a drinking-water advisory and called for 
state financial assistance to switch the water system back to Detroit’s supply. 38 Two weeks 
later, Governor Snyder requested six million dollars from the state legislature to reconnect 
the Flint water system to Detroit. 39 With additional funding from the City and a private 
foundation, the switch was completed in mid-October. 40 

Following the switch back to Detroit water, some government officials began to ask 
questions about what went wrong in the course of Flint’s change in water sources. 41 
Governor Snyder created a task force to review water management and testing in Flint, 42 
and EPA established its own task force “to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through 
regular conversations” with the City and MDEQ. 43 Governor Snyder has also announced

plans to launch an “education campaign soon to help schools statewide learn how to get 
their water tested” for lead. 44 

Despite this proliferation of task forces and campaigns, neither the City nor MDEQ 
has announced changes in the City’s lead monitoring practices in the wake of Flint’s public- 
health crisis. Rather, Flint and MDEQ have maintained that these practices are accurate 
and adequate, despite the near certainty that they are underrepresenting lead contamination 
in many of Flint’s high-risk homes. 

II. City and State officials are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Lead 

and Copper Rule 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act) authorizes citizens to sue any governmental 
entity “who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement” under the statute. 45 These 
requirements include the national primary drinking-water regulations for lead and copper 
set forth in the Dead and Copper Rule. 46 The Lead and Copper Rule obligates water systems 
to monitor and control for lead in drinking water. 47 

Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has failed to comply with the Lead and 
Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring water for lead, notifying the public of tap-water 
monitoring results, reporting monitoring results to MDEQ, and controlling corrosion from 
lead pipes. 48 These violations systematically result in the City’s underestimating lead levels 
in its drinking water, masking a public-health crisis. The violations are ongoing and likely to 
recur in the future: Flint’s water system presently is obligated to monitor for lead every six 
months, and there is no indication that Flint has changed or disavowed its inadequate 
approach to monitoring. 49 


44 See Lori Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 13,

47 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 141.86. 

48 Flint’s water system is subject to the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule because it is a 
“community water system” not otherwise exempted from the regulations. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(a)(1), 
141.2. 

49 See Tamaska v. City of Bluff City, 26 F. App’x 482, 485 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Chesapeake Bay 
Found, v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, 844 F.2d 170, 171-72 (4th Cir. 1988)). A water system is required to 
monitor tap water for lead every six months if it (1) exceeds the action level for any monitoring 
period, or (2) “fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within tire range of values for tire 
water quality parameters specified by the State ... for more than 9 days in any six-month period.” 40 
C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). Flint’s water system failed to maintain applicable values of 
orthophosphate and/or pH designated as the optimal water quality parameters by MDEQ. In 
addition, had the water system conducted monitoring in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule 
during the January to June 2015 period, it likely would have exceeded the lead action level.

Under the Act, a “supplier of water” is “any person who owns or operates a public 
water system.” 50 The City of Flint owns Flint’s water system. 51 Upon information and belief, 
the State officials administering Flint’s receivership and the City presently operate Flint’s 
water system. As discussed above, Flint’s Emergency Manager exercised the authority of 
the local government in the place of Flint’s mayor and city council. The Emergency 
Manager managed the water system and conducted its affairs, including making the 
decision to use the Flint River as a primary drinking-water source. 52 In April 2015, 

Governor Snyder removed the Emergency Manager and appointed a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board to oversee the City’s affairs until the receivership is terminated. 53 
The Board has control over the City’s budget, and must approve all decisions adopted by the 
City Council. 54 The Michigan Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act requires the State 
Treasurer to sit on a receivership transition advisory board for any municipality for which 
the governor appoints such a board, and Governor Snyder has appointed the State Treasurer 
(or his designee) to chair Flint’s Board. 55 The City Administrator reports to the Board, 
manages the City’s daily administrative operations, and directs City department heads in 
carrying out the daily activities of the City. 56 To date, the City remains in receivership, and 
its actions remain subject to approval of the Board. 57

and Beverly Walker-Griffea, Members of the Board; and Natasha Henderson, Flint City 
Administrator, are responsible for the violations of the Act by Flint’s water system which 
have endangered and will continue to endanger the health of Flint’s residents. 

A. Flint's water system is in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule's tap- 
water monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements 

The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify a pool of sampling 
sites prior to the commencement of a monitoring period. 58 This requirement is designed to 
target residences at high risk of lead contamination in drinking water, such as homes served 
by lead service lines. 59 In violation of the Rule, Flint’s water system does not select sampling 
sites for lead monitoring based on a pre-established sampling pool. For Flint’s most recent 
completed monitoring period, January- June 2015, the Director of the City’s Department of 
Public Works admitted that Flint “thr[ew] bottles out everywhere just to collect as many 
[samples] as we can, to try and hit our number.” 60 Similarly, email correspondence shows 
that the City has, during several monitoring periods, asked its own employees to submit tap- 
water samples, without regard to whether the employees were part of a pre-selected 
sampling pool. 61 

Under the Lead and Copper Rule, water systems that contain lead service lines also 
must draw fifty percent of their tap-water samples from sites served by a lead service line. 62 
Flint’s water system does not comply with this requirement. The water system reported to 
MDEQ that all the sample sites it used during the January-June 2015 monitoring period 
were residences served by lead service lines. 63 Flint’s Utilities Administrator, however, 
admitted that he was not able to verify that all homes sampled were served by lead service 
lines. 64 This is because City records concerning the locations of lead service lines in the 
distribution system are stored on 45,000 paper notecards. Flint began converting these 
notecards into an electronic spreadsheet this fall, well after the January-June 2015 
monitoring period. 65

Flint’s water system has also failed to sample the same sites across monitoring 
periods or document the reasons for declining to sample the same sites, as the Lead and 
Copper Rule requires. 66 Sampling new sites from one monitoring period to the next is 
permitted only if a site “is no longer accessible” to the water system or “no longer fits the 
requirements of a priority site.” 67 Records show that in the January-June 2015 monitoring 
period, Flint’s water system retested only thirteen of the one hundred sites it sampled in the 
previous monitoring period. 68 It did not provide the required explanation for these 
departures from the previous monitoring period’s sampling sites. 69 Upon information and 
belief, Flint’s water system concentrated its monitoring in areas where it anticipated low 
lead levels, due to recent infrastructure improvements, and selectively retested sites that had 
previously yielded low lead levels. Such selective sampling violates the Lead and Copper 
Rule’s intention that water systems “do not use only those sampling locations with the 
lowest lead or copper levels.” 70 

Flint’s instructions to residents for the collection of tap-water samples also violate the 
Lead and Copper Rule. The Rule allows residents to collect the tap-water samples used to 
monitor lead in drinking water, so long as the water system instructs residents of the 
sampling procedures required by the regulations. 71 Tap-water samples must be “first-draw 
samples,” meaning that the sample must be collected after water in the tap has stood 
motionless in the plumbing system for at least six hours. 72 Flint’s instructions direct 
residents to flush their taps for five minutes prior to letting the water sit for the six required 
hours. This “pre-flushing” has been shown to “result in the minimization of lead capture 
and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water.” 73 The water system’s pre- 
flush instruction “negates the intent of the [Lead and Copper Rule] to collect compliance

samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions,” 74 and goes “against the intent of the monitoring 
protocol, since it changes the normal water use of the homeowners in the sample.” 75 

Flint’s water system is violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s reporting requirements 
by representing to MDEQ that Flint’s monitoring practices are in compliance with the Rule. 
The City’s water system did not provide documentation to MDEQ justifying its selection of 
new sample sites in the January-June 2015 monitoring period, and, upon information and 
belief, is not accurately reporting information concerning whether sampled sites meet 
required regulatory criteria. 76 

The Lead and Copper Rule also requires Flint’s water system to notify each resident 
whose tap water was sampled of the lead results. 77 Upon information and belief, Flint has 
failed and continues to fail to properly notify all residents whose tap water was tested for 
lead of the individual monitoring results. 

B. Flint's water system has failed to maintain optimal corrosion-control 
treatment 

The Lead and Copper Rule required all large public water systems, including Flint’s 
water system, to install an “optimal corrosion control treatment” program by January 1 , 

199 7. 78 After a system has optimized its corrosion-control treatment, the regulations require 
the system to “continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 79 
Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has not maintained an optimal corrosion-control 
treatment program. Historically, the water system complied with the corrosion-control 
requirements by purchasing treated water from Detroit. When Flint switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, it did nothing to treat the Flint River water to 
control corrosion. This failure to maintain optimized corrosion control violates the Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

Although Flint’s water system has resumed its purchase of treated water from 
Detroit, it has not disavowed its erroneous interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule’s 
corrosion-control requirements. Nor has it committed to maintaining optimized corrosion 
control when it switches water sources again this summer to the KWA pipeline. Flint’s 
water system’s failure to maintain an optimized corrosion-control treatment program is 
likely to recur in the future.

III. The State of Michigan's failure to maintain a schools testing and remediation 
program violates the Safe Drinking Water Act 

The Act requires each state to establish a program “to assist” schools and day care 
centers in “testing for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water.” 80 Test results 
must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 81 Michigan, 
upon information and belief, does not maintain a program for school lead testing, 
remediation, and notification. 82 Accordingly, Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Wyant 
are presently in violation of the Act’s schools provision. 83 

IV. Intent to Sue 

The City of Flint and Michigan state officials have been and continue to be in 
violation of the Tead and Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring and sampling tap 
water for lead, notifying the public of and reporting to the State tap-water monitoring 
results, and corrosion control. Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant are in 
violation of the Act’s requirement to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with 
testing and remediating lead in school drinking water. These violations are likely to 
continue and to recur in the future absent a judicial decree ordering City and State officials 
to comply with the Act. If the City of Flint and the Michigan state officials identified above 
fail to cure their noncompliance with the Act within sixty days, Concerned Pastors for 
Social Action, Melissa Mays, ACLU of Michigan, and NRDC will file suit in federal 
district court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and litigation costs, as appropriate.

Hi Richard, 

The Governor is proud of the efforts his office has made to increase transparency and accountability, including 
dashboards featuring metrics for each department and creation of a citizen's guide to how state and local 
governments spend money. We're always focusing on continuous quality improvement in this area. 

The Governor also has promised complete cooperation with the independent Flint Water Task Force that is reviewing 
all state, local and federal actions related to the situation as the administration focuses on the health and welfare of 
people in Flint and across the state.

Subject: FYI- Release going shortly re: Flint Emergency Declaration 

Good afternoon, 

Just wanted you all to know that we're issuing the following press release shortly regarding the Governor declaring an 
emergency in Genesee County and activating the State Emergency Operations Center. The declaration will be attached 
with it. 

Thanks! 

Gov. Snyder declares emergency for Genesee County 

State Emergency Operations Center activated to assist with relief efforts 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today declared a state of emergency for Genesee County 
due to the ongoing health and safety issues caused by lead in the city of Flint’s drinking water. 

By declaring a state of emergency, Snyder has made available all state resources in cooperation 
with local response and recovery operations. The declaration authorizes the Michigan State 
Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division (MSP/EMHSD) to coordinate 
state efforts. 

“The health and welfare of Flint residents is a top priority and we’re committed to a coordinated 
approach with resources from state agencies to address all aspects of this situation,” Snyder said. 
“Working in full partnership with the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, all levels of government and 
water quality experts, we will find both short-term and long-term solutions to ensure the health and 
safety of Flint residents.” 

In addition to the emergency declaration, Snyder activated the State Emergency Operations 
Center to coordinate state response and recovery activities. State agencies will report to the 
center to coordinate resources, assess the situation and begin providing assets to assist with local 


i 


relief operations. 

“Our staff recognizes the urgency of this situation and is already working closely with local 
officials,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, Deputy State Director of Emergency Management and 
Homeland Security and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. “We will continue to collaborate with 
state, city and county leaders to coordinate relief efforts, streamline communication and use all 
available resources to help residents.” 

On Jan. 4, Genesee County declared a “local state of emergency,” which activated local 
emergency response and recovery plans. By requesting a governor’s declaration, the county has 
determined local resources are insufficient to address the situation and state assistance is 
required to protect public health, safety and property to lessen or avert the threat of a crisis. 

The city of Flint has been under a local emergency declaration since Dec. 14, 2015. 

The SEOC is the emergency operations center for the state of Michigan. Located in Lansing, the 
center is overseen by the MSP/EMHSD and coordinates response and recovery efforts by state 
agencies and local government. The SEOC is staffed by members of state agencies and other 
partners for decision making and information coordination during disasters or emergencies in the 
state of Michigan.

Water Capacity Report 

Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014.pdf 


Dan -- Two questions leapt out at me from this report: 

-The statement that in a few years, the non-community water supplies will have a serious cost hit them for total coliform 
(bacterial) compliance and no funding to address it. Is that something we should be looking at trying to support in 
longer-term budgets? 

-The fact that we are not hitting our goals for avoiding acute health risks for water quality (not hitting 95% 
compliant). Is this mostly the Flint problem showing up in the stats or are there other areas with drinking water quality 
acute problems?

Dear Governor Snyder: 

The enclosed Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 (Report) is required 
by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to be submitted to you. 

The 1996 amendments to the federal SDWA require each state to develop a Capacity 
Development Program (CDP) to ensure that community and noncommunity water 
systems acquire and maintain technical, managerial, and financial capacity to ensure a 
safe, reliable, and abundant supply of drinking water to all customers. Michigan’s CDP 
is implemented by the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Office of Drinking 
Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA), through Michigan’s Safe Drinking Water 
Act, 1976 PA 399, as amended; by the application of CDP policies and guidance 
documents; and through cooperation and/or partnerships with other agencies. 

This Report discusses Michigan’s CDP and examines the effectiveness of the strategy, 
progress towards improving capacity, and additional efforts that help to enhance 
capacity. This Report will be available to the public on the DEQ’s Web site at 
http://www.michigan.gov/deqwater, at the ODWMA’s district offices, and at the public’s 
request. 

if you need further information, please contact Ms. Liane J. Shekter Smith, P.E., Chief, 
ODWMA, at 517-284-6543; shekteri@michigan.gov; or DEQ, P.O. Box 30241, Lansing,

Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


Executive Summary 

The 1996 Amendments to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) added provisions for 
each state to develop a Capacity Development Program (CDP). The objective of the CDP is to 
enhance public health protection by helping water systems develop and maintain the capability, 
or capacity, they need to deliver a safe, reliable, and adequate supply of drinking water to ail 
customers. Capacity has three components: 

• Technical - Physical infrastructure and operational ability 

• Managerial - Personnel expertise and institutional and administrative capabilities 

• Financial - Monetary resources 

The purpose of this document is to report to Governor Rick Snyder the effectiveness of 
Michigan's capacity development strategy as managed by the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for the 2011-2013 time period. Each state risks losing 
20 percent of the annual Drinking Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) allotment if it does not submit 
a report to its Governor by September 30 of every third year or does not make the report 
available to the public under Section 1420(c)(3) of the SDWA. 

Many capacity development-related activities have been conducted and incorporated into 
Michigan's drinking water program since its inception in 1913 and later integrated into the 
Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399). In addition to 
establishing health-based standards, Act 399 also includes requirements for water well isolation, 
system reliability, operator certification, standards of construction, and system planning. As a 
result, the strategy to help systems maintain technical, managerial, and financial (TMF) capacity 
is a reflection of our long-standing tradition of technical assistance, with the recent addition of a 
capacity assessment component. 

The strategy is effective. New public water systems are demonstrating adequate capacity 
before they begin serving water to the public, and existing systems are continuing to enhance 
and maintain capacity. A strong emphasis on assistance has moved systems toward enhanced 
capacity. 

Systems with adequate TMF capacity are able to maintain high rates of compliance with 
health-based standards. Additionally, systems use a multibarrier approach to providing safe 
water to the public, which begins with securing a safe source, such as groundwater from a 
confined aquifer, and then protecting that source from contamination. The multibarrier approach 
continues with proper construction of water wells, pumps, treatment plants, and distribution 
systems. Finally, well-trained, certified operators perform proper oversight (operation and 
maintenance) and conduct routine monitoring to ensure that these multiple barriers continue to 
function. 

Systems are also taking advantage of programs to enhance their TMF capacity. These 
programs help systems stay in compliance with existing requirements, prepare systems to 
comply with upcoming requirements, and help operators and local officials to better manage 
their systems. These programs include: 

• DWRF: The 1 996 Amendments to the SDWA provide low-interest loans for repairs or 
enhancements to help water systems comply with the SDWA. To date, the DWRF has 


ii 



Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


committed over $758 million in low-interest loans for 252 projects to construct, upgrade, 
and replace infrastructure. 

• Relationship with MDEQ District staff: Water system operators maintain a relationship 
with district staff who are the primary contact with water systems for capacity 
development. A prime objective of the district staff is to provide excellent customer 
service, from the construction permit process through regulatory oversight, and continual 
assessment and assistance for the duration of a system’s operation. 

* Source Water Protection: An increasing number of systems are taking steps to protect 
their drinking water sources. 

o Federal funding for Wellhead Protection Programs (WHPPs) is available through 
the DWRF for systems using groundwater. Under the sponsorship of the MDEQ, 
Michigan State University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering 
recently developed an innovative modeling tool for mapping Michigan’s Wellhead 
Protection Areas (WHPAs). The new tool, which is now called the Michigan 
Groundwater Management Tool (MGMT), makes systematic and intelligent use 
of statewide groundwater-related data to develop a WHPA. The MDEQ uses the 
MGMT to delineate WHPAs at no cost. Before the MGMT, the cost for producing 
a traditional WHPA was an average of $36,000 to the public water system. The 
MGMT has provided nearly 2,600 provisional WHPAs in the state. 

o Beginning in fiscal year 201 5, the MDEQ will also provide a new surface water 
intake protection grant to assist in the development and implementation of a plan 
to protect surface water sources used for public drinking water. 

o Operator Certification and Training: Act 399 requires a certified operator to be 
available at all community and nontransient noncommunity water systems. 

These operators must maintain their certification by earning continuing education 
credits. As a result, new training courses are developed based on operator 
feedback and district staff input and in response to new regulations with which 
water systems must comply. 

o Other programs available to systems include financial assessments, technical 
assistance provider services, security training, and electronic reporting systems. 

New regulations will continue to challenge water systems. The United States Environmental 
Protection Agency promulgated regulations to expand requirements on systems that disinfect. 
The Stage 2 Disinfection Byproducts Rule builds incrementally on existing rules and requires 
systems to further evaluate their distribution systems. Systems must identify the locations with 
high disinfection byproduct concentrations and sample these sites to determine compliance at 
each location. For the first time, many consecutive systems are now required to monitor for 
disinfection byproducts. 

The Ground Water Rule was promulgated to reduce the risk of exposure to fecal contamination 
that may be present in public water systems that use groundwater sources. Groundwater 
systems with identified risks may be required to perform source water monitoring, implement 
corrective action, or conduct further compliance monitoring. 

The Revised Total Coliform Rule (RTCR), which takes effect in early 2016, will require all public 
water systems that are vulnerable to microbial contamination to identify and fix problems. The 


Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


RTCR will also establish more stringent criteria for systems to qualify for and stay on reduced 
monitoring, thereby providing incentives for improved water system operation. 

The impact of the RTCR on resources will be nominal to Michigan’s Community Water Supply 
Program but wiil be significant to Michigan’s Noncommunity Water Supply Program. There are 
approximately 9,800 noncommunity water supplies in Michigan. Among the 50 states, Michigan 
and Wisconsin have the largest number of noncommunity water supplies in the country. 
Michigan’s Noncommunity Water Supply Program is administered by local public health 
departments under contract with the DEQ. All of the local public health departments will see 
increased workload demands under the RTCR without additional financial compensation for the 
work. 

The continuing endeavors of water systems to maintain technical, managerial, and financial 
capacity will help them meet the challenges of these new regulations. This report is available 
on the MDEQ’s Web site at http://www.michigan.gov/deqwater and to the public in paper format, 
on request.

1.0 Introduction 

This report examines the effectiveness of the strategy, progress toward improving capacity, and 
tools used to help to improve capacity. 

1. 1 Capacity Development Program (CDP) Overview 

Water system capacity is the ability to plan for, achieve, and maintain compliance with drinking 
water requirements. Capacity has three components: 

• Technical - Physical infrastructure and operational ability 

• Managerial - Personnel expertise and institutional and administrative capabilities 

• Financial - Monetary resources 

Michigan's capacity development strategy is to help community water systems (CWS) and 
noncommunity water systems (NCWS) achieve and maintain technical, managerial, and 
financial (TMF) capacity by adding a capacity assessment component to the Public Water 
System Supervision Program. The strategy is an ongoing process to: 

• Assess systems’ capacity or "capability." 

• Prioritize systems most in need of assistance. 

• Determine the best means of assistance. 

• Provide assistance or refer systems to other capacity assistance or technical assistance 
providers. 

• Measure improvements in TMF capacity during subsequent assessments. 

The CDP is implemented by the MDEQ, Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance 
(ODWMA), through amendments to the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 1976 PA 399, as 
amended (Act 399); by application of CDP policies and guidance documents; and through 
cooperation and/or partnerships with other agencies. 

The CDP focuses on both new systems and existing systems. The new systems program 
ensures systems have sufficient capacity prior to commencing operation, and the existing 
systems program works to achieve, maintain, and enhance capacity. These two programs are 
detailed in two documents and were approved by the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (USEPA) in 2000. 

1.1.1 New Systems 

New Community Water System Capacity Guideline Document, May 1 , 2000. New systems 
must demonstrate TMF capacity before serving water to the public. The new systems program 
relies on two control points: construction permits and final inspection. Generally, a construction 
permit is issued based on the technical capacity of the proposed system. For CWS, the 
financial and managerial capacity requirements may still be pending while the system is under 
construction. Approval to commence operation is only granted after a final inspection when the 
CWS has demonstrated capacity in all three areas. 


1 



Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


For nontransient noncommunity water systems (NTNCWS), the ODWMA has delegated the 
authority to the local health departments (LHD) to review, approve, and issue construction 
permits. When these water systems begin the permit application process, the LHD helps them 
outline their financial and managerial capacity. Prior to receiving approval to commence 
operation, the NTNCWS must submit a financial plan and a managerial plan that includes an 
emergency response plan and designation of a certified operator. 

1.1.2 Existing Systems 

Capacity Development Strategy for Existing Public Water Systems, August 1 , 2000. The 
existing system strategy relies primarily on the capacity assistance component of the drinking 
water program, which the ODWMA has traditionally referred to as technical assistance. 

Through routine system evaluations, also known as sanitary surveys or capacity assessments, 
ODWMA staff identify which systems need capacity assistance and prioritizes assistance 
subject to available resources. The ODWMA will not request a financial capacity assessment of 
an existing water system unless violations, deficiencies, or other factors indicate the system 
lacks technical or managerial capacity. For CWS, capacity assistance is provided through 
ODWMA staff or through other technical assistance providers to help communities build TMF 
capacity. For NCWS, the ODWMA delegated the authority to the LHD to assess capacity and to 
provide assistance. If capacity assistance is not accepted or effective, Michigan practices a 
program of progressive enforcement. 

1.2 Involved Parties 

The CDP encompasses the efforts of water systems, the MDEQ, technical assistance providers, 
and other organizations and agencies that affect the capabilities of water systems including: 

• MDEQ, ODWMA, Field Operations Section 

• MDEQ, ODWMA, Revolving Loan Section 

• LHDs 

• MDEQ, ODWMA, Environmental Health Section 

• Michigan Finance Authority 

• Technical Assistance Providers such as: 

o Michigan Section, American Waterworks Association (AWWA) 
o Michigan Rural Water Association 
o Rural Community Assistance Program (RCAP) 

o United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Rural Utilities 
Service 

• MDEQ, ODWMA, Enforcement Section

Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


2.0 Effectiveness of the Capacity Development Strategy 

Many capacity development-related activities have been conducted and incorporated into 
Michigan's drinking water program since its inception in 1913 and later integrated into Act 399. 

In addition to establishing health-based standards, Act 399 also includes requirements for well 
isolation, system reliability, operator certification, standards of construction, and system 
planning. As a result, the strategy to help systems maintain TMF capacity is a reflection of our 
long-standing tradition of technical assistance, with the recent addition of a capacity assessment 
component. 

The strategy is effective. New public water systems are demonstrating adequate capacity 
before they begin serving water to the public, and existing systems are continuing to enhance 
and maintain capacity. A strong emphasis on capacity assistance has moved systems toward 
enhanced capacity. 

2 . 1 New Systems 

New systems must demonstrate TMF capacity before serving water to the public. As a result, 
they are better able to remain in compliance with health-based standards and monitoring 
requirements. When violations occur, they are usually minor monitoring violations. District staff 
report that new systems that have complied with capacity development requirements are well 
developed from start-up and perform at a higher level than some older systems. These new 
systems. use modern technology, competent engineering support, and acceptable management. 
Prior to a formalized CDP, district staff only required adequate technical capacity before a 
construction permit was issued. 

2.1.1 CWS 

Proposed CWS are primarily new residential developments such as subdivisions, apartment 
complexes, and elderly care facilities. District staff interacts with developers and their 
engineering consultant to complete the capacity assessments before approval is granted to 
serve water to the public. Most developers who phase their projects understand that it is more 
cost-effective to install a system meeting CWS requirements at the beginning of the project 
instead of upgrading the water system when they expand. In addition to the traditional technical 
assessment, these new CWS must complete financial and managerial assessments. The 
financial capacity assessment requires some thought about future operations and costs. The 
managerial capacity assessment requires an operations plan, a certified operator, a sampling 
site plan, as well as other plans to ensure the system has adequate managerial oversight and 
organization before commencing operation. 

A system that simply increases the number of customers without having to alter or construct 
water system infrastructure is not considered a new system. However, the following existing 
systems are considered new and subject to capacity development policies: 

• Systems that did not meet the definition of a CWS at start-up, but are designed to one 
day meet the definition. 

• Systems that are not currently a CWS, but propose to extend the water system to serve 
additional customers, thereby growing to become a CWS. These systems are usually 
privately-owned, residential subdivisions that were previously exempt from CWS 
requirements due to their small size. 


3 




Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


Many times, a new developer begins to expand a subdivision or the original developer returns to 
complete a final phase after many years. These systems pose the greatest challenge because 
they often expand before fully complying with capacity development requirements and because 
the control point of a final inspection before commencing operation no longer exists, 

2.1.2 NTNCWS 

Due to the financial and managerial capacity requirements now placed on new NTNCWS, these 
systems have a qualified operator and a higher level of awareness of the responsibilities of 
supplying water to the public. These systems begin operation with an emergency response 
plan already in place— a valuable tool during emergencies. 

2.2 Existing Systems 

Existing systems are achieving and maintaining TMF capacity as demonstrated by their high 
rates of compliance, as discussed in section 3.1 , and their efforts to manage their systems 
effectively with qualified and educated staff to meet the needs of their customers. This 
improved compliance rate is a result of several factors, including: 

• District staff interaction with systems. 

• Financial assistance in the form of loans and grants. 

• Financial management assistance. 

• Source water protection and water system security programs. 

• Operator training and certification. 

• Compliance and enforcement interaction via letters, phone calls, site visits, and 
administrative fines. 

• Support of data systems for MDEQ district staff and LHDs. 

• Support of Web sites for MDEQ district staff, LHDs, and water systems. 

• Policy updates, guides, fact sheets, templates, and forms provided to district staff, LHDs, 
and systems. 

Many of these factors will be discussed in Section 4. 

3.0 Progress Toward Improving TMF 

Systems with adequate TMF capacity maintain high rates of compliance with health-based 
standards, monitoring, reporting, and other capacity requirements, which is one measure of 
success of the CDP. A multibarrier approach to providing safe water is more difficult to 
measure, but it is an integral part of ensuring water systems have sufficient TMF capacity. 
Through the construction permit and sanitary survey process, district staff helps to ensure 
systems obtain a safe source and continue to provide safe drinking water.

Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


3 . 1 Compliance Rates 

Comparing compiiance data from one year to the next is difficult because of the rapidly 
increasing number and complexity of rules and requirements each year. With new regulations 
that have had a disproportionate impact on small systems, the number of systems in 
compliance may not tell the true story of improved capacity. 

Small systems make up the majority of systems in Michigan as well as the majority of systems 
in noncompliance. However, the majority of the population served by CWS is supplied by larger 
systems that generally comply with requirements. To put compliance data into perspective, it 
may be useful to compare the percent of population served by CWS that are in compliance with 
health-based standards and monitoring and reporting requirements. 

The following table summarizes compliance in Michigan with health-based drinking water 
standards and with monitoring and reporting requirements compared to the goals shared with 
the USEPA for fiscal year (FY) 201 1 to FY 201 3:

1 Significant monitoring violations are generally defined as any major monitoring violation. A major monitoring 
violation, with rare exceptions, occurs when no samples were taken or no results were reported. 


2 Acute health risks mean those contaminants that have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of 
short-term exposure. 

*Not available at this time due to recent changes in the EPA data system. 

Compliance with monitoring requirements is considered a measure of success. However, the 
failure to collect a sample is not necessarily a direct public health threat because Michigan's 
drinking water program does not automatically assume the absence of a sample creates a 
public health threat, as discussed in the following section. A missed sample from a properly 
constructed water system having a satisfactory history of safe samples is a concern, but not a 
direct threat to public health. 

3 . 2 Multibarrier Approach 

The multibarrier approach to providing safe drinking water begins with securing a safe source, 
such as a confined aquifer, and protecting that source from contamination, it continues with 
proper construction of water wells, pumps, treatment plants, and distribution systems. Proper 
oversight and monitoring by trained personnel provide confirmation that the multiple barriers are 
functioning and the integrity of the water system is maintained. 

Act 399 provides public health protection through requirements on construction of wells, surface 
water intakes, treatment facilities, and distribution systems. Construction permits require an 
engineering review and a sound basis of design that incorporates reliability and redundancy. 


5 



Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


Some aspects of management and operations are also regulated. A cross connection control 
program must be developed and implemented in municipal systems to eliminate and prevent 
potential pathways for contaminants to enter the water system. A system must also conduct a 
study of water supply requirements and update it every five years. A general plan, or layout and 
description of the water system and its service area, must be submitted. This plan now requires 
systems which intend to provide fire protection to include a hydraulic analysis showing 
pressures under peak demands; an inventory of main size, material, and age; and maps 
showing existing and future boundaries. Finally, an emergency response plan (ERP) must be 
developed. These long-standing requirements are key to achieving and maintaining capacity. 
Compliance with these requirements is part of the continual sanitary survey or evaluation 
process by district staff. 

The ODWMA is encouraging systems, particularly new systems, to consider both short- and 
long-term needs and expected growth as they determine their water capacity requirements and 
develop their general plans and ERPs. This asset management approach is expected to 
enhance their capacity to manage their assets at the lowest possible cost. 

The 1996 amendments to the SDWA required states to assess all source waters used for 
drinking water. All of Michigan’s nearly 18,000 sources were assessed in 2003 to identify areas 
that supply public drinking water, to evaluate the susceptibility of those water systems to 
contamination, and to inform the public of the results. After the heavy investment in the 
assessment process, efforts are being made to move from assessment to protection. Water 
systems are encouraged to protect their sources through voluntary programs discussed in 
section 4, Tools Used to Improve TMF. 

Finally, oversight of the water system by qualified operators helps to ensure all the elements of 
the waterworks system are functioning. Each CWS and NTNCWS and certain TNCWS must be 
under the responsible charge of an operator certified by the MDEQ. Larger systems are also 
required to designate a certified backup operator. Certification is renewable through continued 
education credits obtained through training approved by the MDEQ. 

4.0 Tools Used to Improve TMF 

This section discusses some of the tools used to enhance system TMF capacity, to achieve and 
maintain compliance with requirements, to prepare for new regulations, and to better manage 
water systems. 

4. 1 Drinking Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) 

The 1996 amendments to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) authorized the creation 
of a revolving fund to provide low-interest loans for repairs or enhancements to help water 
systems comply with the SDWA. This fund is similar to the State Revolving Fund created to 
assist water pollution control projects. Many of the capacity development provisions of the 
SDWA are funded through the DWRF allotment. 

Prior to the creation of the DWRF, project financing for CWS was left largely to the local unit of 
government or to individuals investing in their own systems. The DWRF provides a source of 
infrastructure financing. To date, the DWRF has committed over $768 million in low-interest 
loans for 252 infrastructure projects. Of the 252 projects with committed funds, 223 have been 
completed, and the loan payments are revolving back into the fund. Some systems receive 
commitments from the DWRF, but may not be ready to proceed with the project until they are 


6 



Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


able to assure the revenues will be generated to repay the loan. In these cases, the system 
remains on the priority list for the next year. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on 
February 17, 2009. Included in the ARRA was an additional $2 billion in capitalization for 
DWRF administered by the states, of which Michigan received $67,454,000. These funds 
provided Michigan with the ability to tender more loans through the DWRF and provided 
additional subsidy (principal forgiveness for 40 percent of a project’s cost). To date, 21 of the 
28 ARRA funded projects have been completed. 

The following table summarizes the loan commitments for FY 201 1 to FY 2013:

Commitments in FY 2013 include projects to increase systems’ capacity to reliably provide an 
adequate supply of water. Many of the projects involve replacing aging distribution 
infrastructure. 

The city of Ann Arbor made improvements to their Barton Dam Intake Pump Station to include 
the replacement of switchgear, motors, transformers, starters, disconnects, and other 
associated equipment. They added soft starts, control improvements, and added a 29 kilowatt 
generator. These projects were funded at just over three million dollars. 

Bay County is building a new water treatment plant to replace the city of Bay City’s current 
plant. In addition, two raw water transmission lines will receive water from Lake Huron through 
the Saginaw Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation. This source will provide more 
consistent and higher water quality than the current source in Saginaw Bay. The installation of 
membrane filtration and new variable frequency drives will qualify for green project funding to 
allow over seven million dollars in principal forgiveness. 

Michigan's drinking water program relies heavily upon proper water system design and 
construction to prevent jeopardizing the safety of both the source and finished water. To that 
end, priority of DWRF projects favors communities that are participating in a Source Water 
Protection Program (SWPP), which is discussed in section 4.4. 

4,2 District Staff 

Water system operators develop a relationship with district staff who are the primary contact for 
capacity development. The CWS are served by ODWMA staff in one of 8 district offices, and 
NCWS are served by staff from one of 44 LHDs under contract with the ODWMA. A primary 
objective of district staff is to provide excellent customer service from the construction permit 
process for new infrastructure through the continual assessment and oversight process during 
operation.

Capacity Deveiopment Report to the Governor 2014 


Assistance or consultation during site visits has been the preferred method to maintain system 
compliance. District staff serve as both capacity assistance providers as well as regulators. 
When assistance is not accepted or effective, staff initiate enforcement actions. 

Capacity of systems is assessed through the sanitary survey process. District staff detail their 
findings and recommendations in a letter to the system, which may include a list of items to 
address and deadlines to meet. Options for capacity assistance may also be offered, such as 
contacting a technical assistance provider. Sanitary survey letters help systems understand the 
severity of the deficiencies and importance of acting on the recommendations. For CWS, the 
sanitary survey includes an overall evaluation to indicate no deficiencies, minimal deficiencies, 
or significant deficiencies exist. 

The following table summarizes sanitary surveys, visits, and timeliness of construction permits 
issued for CWS:

The data reflect the following: 

• The number of visits has increased approximately 10 percent over the previous 
three-year reporting time frame of this report. This increase may be due to the filling of 
previous vacancies in the district offices. 

• The average number of days to issue simple water main permits has been reduced by 
20 percent over the last three years, even with an increase in the total number of permits 
issued. 

Deficient systems receive priority for assistance. Ratings are based on compliance with health- 
based standards, monitoring requirements, qualified operator requirements, and requirements in 
Act 399 for TMF sufficiency, such as well construction, general and emergency response plans, 
and financial requirements for privately-owned systems. 

Two ODWMA policies and procedures were developed recently to help district staff effectively 
use sanitary surveys and address water system deficiencies. The sanitary survey policy 
confirms the requirements for surveys to be conducted every three years; however, a reduced 
survey frequency may apply if certain criteria are met. In addition, surveys may be performed 
more frequently if significant deficiencies exist or corrective action is necessary. The significant 
deficiency policy was developed to help staff identify a significant deficiency and set forth steps 
to resolve the deficiencies. These policies help staff provide greater oversight and attention to 
those deficiencies that also helped CWS return to compliance or obtain a satisfactory rating in 
the next survey.

Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


Often staff have found that a one-time capacity assistance meeting is sufficient to keep systems 
in compliance. In other situations, the district engineer spends more time with the system 
operators to help solve more complicated concerns or refers the system to other capacity 
assistance providers. At times, water system operators want to comply, but lack the financial 
resources or support from community leaders to make necessary changes. When capacity 
assistance is met with resistance, enforcement notices are used to outline the consequences of 
failing to correct deficiencies. These letters may offer one more opportunity to meet with staff to 
arrive at a mutually agreed upon compliance schedule. 

In some cases, district staff may meet with community leaders or attend municipal meetings to 
discuss the benefits of agreeing to a course of action with a compliance schedule that allows 
them time to address their problems without further enforcement or penalties. 

System operators and managers have many other opportunities to interact with district staff 
outside the capacity assessment arena. District staff attend, participate, and present at periodic 
regional operator meetings to discuss upcoming regulations and regional issues and to network 
with operators and managers. District staff also serve as instructors at operator training 
workshops, serve as subject matter experts (SME) for operator certification examinations, and 
present training at professional meetings. When a system begins to develop a project plan to 
apply for a DWRF loan, district staff consult with the system and work with its consulting 
engineer to ensure the project plan addresses system priorities. 

As previously mentioned, oversight of NCWS is provided by 44 LHDs under contract with the 
ODWMA. The NCWS staff maintains communication with each of the 44 LHDs during the year. 
This communication occurs during the formal quarterly reviews and annual evaluations of each 
of the 44 LHD's work in achieving and maintaining water system compliance. Training of LHD 
staff is conducted extensively during these visits to inform, explain, and discuss new and 
updated program issues and procedures. The NCWS staff periodically updates a handbook for 
LHDs and distributes it to LHD staff. This handbook includes policies, procedures, guidance, 
templates, and forms to implement the drinking water program. The NCWS staff also presents 
topics at groundwater, other environmental health conferences, and training webinars. 

4.3 Financial Assessments 

Both new and existing systems have opportunities to achieve and maintain financial capacity. 
Financial capacity assessments are not required of existing systems unless serious deficiencies 
in technical or managerial capacity exist. However, voluntary participation in financial 
assessments has been increasing. 

4.3.1 New Systems 

New systems must demonstrate financial capacity before serving water to the public. In the 
NCWS Program, the system may receive help from the LHD during the permit application 
process to develop a financial plan. They must submit a financial plan, including a budget, to 
the LHD in order to receive approval to commence operation. In the CWS Program, systems 
submit their financial plan and supporting documents to the MDEQ for review and approval 
during the construction permit stage. Systems may complete their financial plan during the 
construction phase of the water system, but must receive approval prior to the final inspection to 
commence operation of the water system.

Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


4.3,2 Existing Systems 

To help existing CWS improve financial capacity, the ODWMA conducted financial assessments 
of systems that serve a population of less than 10,000 that could benefit from and agreed to an 
assessment. An analyst in the ODWMA revolving loan program assesses the selected 
communities' existing financial health and develops Financial Action Plans (FAP). The 
assessment is a review of financial documents and an on-site meeting with system 
representatives. An FAP is a tailor-made comprehensive plan to strengthen the system's 
financial situation based on the assessment. Short- and long-range goals are identified in the 
FAP followed by a step-by-step process to reach the goals. Useful tools to help complete the 
steps are included with the FAP, such as a sample water use and rate ordinance and a service 
agreement checklist. The assessment is not designed to provide funding; however, financing 
options are discussed at the on-site meeting. Further information on obtaining funding is 
provided with the FAP, such as forms to help apply to the DWRF. The system is expected to 
carry out the FAP, and the ODWMA is available to assist when requested. The FAP is intended 
to also be a guide for district staff. An outline of a typical assessment report is included in the 
Appendix. From FY 2011 to FY 2013, 7 CWS underwent financial assessments. 

Another tool to help systems with financial and managerial capacity through asset management 
is the Check Up Program for Small Systems. This no-cost software program released by the 
USEPA can help small systems to develop an asset management plan. 

4.4 Source Protection 

Systems are continuing to take steps to protect their drinking water sources. The SDWA 
established and funded source water assessment activities, including Wellhead Protection 
Programs (WHPP) and Surface Water Intake Protection Programs (SWIPP) through the DWRF. 
The SDWA did not provide funding specifically for implementation of SWIPPs for surface water 
sources. Authority has been obtained to provide grants for communities to protect their surface 
water intake areas through the DWRF capacity development set aside funds, which is later 
described in Section 4.4.2. 

4.4.1 Source Water Assessments to Protection 

The SDWA required that all of Michigan's 18,000 CWS and NCWS drinking water sources be 
assessed in 2003. Potential sources of contamination were inventoried, and susceptibility to 
contamination was determined by the combined efforts of the ODWMA and local, state, and 
national agencies. A project to update the CWS assessments began in 2012 and are planned 
to be completed within the next three years as district staff conduct their sanitary surveys. The 
NCWS and LHD staff, which oversee these systems, have been provided a self-assessment 
form to identify risks to their source water and identify actions they can take to reduce those 
risks. 


4.4.2 SWPP 

A Wellhead Protection Program (WHPP) is a SWPP for water systems that rely upon water 
wells and it assists communities in protecting their groundwater sources. A goal of a WHPP is 
to minimize the potential for contamination by identifying and protecting the area that contributes 
to water supply wells and avoids costly groundwater cleanups. Of the 438 municipal systems in 
Michigan using groundwater as their water supply, 353 are involved in some aspect of wellhead 
protection, such as performing a delineation, inventorying the potential sources of 
contamination, and planning for emergencies. Of those 353 systems, 242 have completed all 


10 


Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


the steps and have an approved WHPP or have met the substantial implementation standard. 

As a result, 80 percent of the population that obtains drinking water from groundwater is in 
communities taking action to protect their sources. Municipalities are encouraged to apply for a 
WHPP grant using a 50 percent local and 50 percent state match to fund activities involved in 
protecting their wellheads and updating their approved programs. 

The ODWMA, Field Operations Section (FOS), through a contract with Michigan State 
University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, developed the Michigan 
Groundwater Management Tool (MGMT), formally known as Michigan Interactive Groundwater 
for Wellhead Protection. The MGMT can scientifically map wellhead protection areas for public 
water supply wells using information from existing statewide databases such as Wellogic, Map 
Image Viewer, and the Groundwater Inventory Mapping project. The Wellhead Protection Area 
(WHPA) is the surface and subsurface area contributing groundwater to the well. Michigan’s 
WHPP defines the WHPA with a 10-year time-of-travel. This provides a reasonable length of 
time to respond to environmental problems within the WHPA while providing an area that can be 
reasonably managed. The MGMT has developed comparably accurate predictions of spatially- 
detailed and representative groundwater flow patterns and WHPAs. Most of these MGMT 
delineations closely parallel traditionally developed WHPA’s, which cost an average $36,000. 

The ODWMA, FOS, is in the process of redefining “Substantial Implementation,” allowing 
smaller systems to obtain this source water protection status, while increasing Michigan’s 
population that is protected by these implemented activities. Nonmunicipal water systems can 
obtain substantial implementation by using a self-assessment to identify specific risks to their 
drinking water sources. Once risks have been identified, corrective actions can be put in place 
to reduce risk of contamination. This allows these systems to obtain substantial implementation 
since they have limited control of their WHPA as compared to municipal systems that may have 
local control by land use planning and ordinances. A total of 893 CWS and 895 NTNCWS 
systems had provisional delineations completed by the MGMT. 

The SWIPP is the surface water counterpart to the WHPP. Under this program, communities 
develop partnerships with surrounding communities to identify and take action to protect the 
area around the intake and the watershed that impacts it. To date, seven communities have 
completed a SWIPP. A SWIPP grant program will begin in FY 2015, which may stimulate 
activities for municipalities that utilize surface water as their source for drinking water. 

To further protect surface water intakes, the ODWMA worked with federal and local 
governmental agencies to install a continuous, real-time water quality monitoring network in the 
St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River. Thirteen drinking water treatment facilities are 
equipped with a range of analytical devices. In addition, the city of Monroe has installed a probe 
for blue-green algae recently due to their vulnerability of microcystin produced by blue-green 
algae. The monitoring system includes data transmission, data visualization, automated 
notification/alarm service, and data archiving. In addition, rapid toxicity test equipment is being 
used to monitor water distribution systems in Southeast Michigan served by some of these 
surface water intakes. Nearly instantaneous communication is key to protecting surface water 
intakes because of the rapid rate of flow and corresponding changes in water quality compared 
to groundwater rates. Funding for this monitoring network helped purchase the equipment; 
however, local communities must pay to continue operation and maintenance of this equipment.

4.5 Operator Training and Certification 

Due to amendments to Act 399, a properly certified operator must be available at all CWS, all 
NTNCWS, and certain TNCWS. These operators maintain their certification by meeting 
continuing education requirements through training offered in a variety of venues. 

4.5.1 Operator Training and Certification Program (OTCP) 

The ODWMA, OTCP, provides over 30 training courses each year. The OTCP certifies over 
200 organizations and training providers that offer other opportunities for continuing education, 
including online courses. Operators certified in distribution systems must provide oversight at 
over 1,400 CWS and approximately 1,500 NTNCWS. Operators certified in treatment systems 
must provide oversight at CWS and NCWS that employ treatment. 

A CWS that occasionally finds itself without a certified operator is usually due to unanticipated 
operator turnover, retirements, and the like. District staff work with each of these water systems 
to pursue an interim certified operator while also pursuing a permanent replacement. There is 
continual turnover of certified operators in NCWS, and the effort to retain certified operators at 
these small systems is an ongoing process. 

Major OTCP activities during FY 2011 to FY 2013 include: 

• Training opportunities available for small community and nontransient, noncommunity 
operators to meet renewal requirements for their certifications. 

• Streamlined the operator certification renewal process. 

• Offered webinars for continued education credits. 

• Utilized subject matter experts (SME) to validate new questions for licensing 
examinations. The SME include water system operators holding licenses of the highest 
level in their category. 

• Full implementation and promotion of a Web-based application allowing certified 
operators to view pertinent information regarding their certifications such as certificate 
renewal status, the list of courses completed, and other information. 

• Provide a Web-based listing of all courses approved by the Advisory Board of Examiners 
(ABE) to assist drinking water personnel in accessing available training in order to 
maintain certification. 

• Maintaining an Intranet Web-based program allowing ODWMA technical staff access to 
readily confirm a certified operator’s status, 

• Web-based search capabilities to manage and track certification and continuing 
education status of all staff associated with a specific water system. 

• Development of all exams using Scantron scored questions, validated by SMEs. 

• Promotion of the Level 5 Guide Book geared towards operators of NTNCWS. 


12 


Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


• Implementation of rule changes to include technical and managerial training categories 
for continuing education requirements upon renewal. 

4.5.2 Small System Training 

For the past several years, ODWMA staff has conducted training specifically for small CWS and 
awarded continuing education credits to operators who participated. Many attendees are 
operators employed by more than one system or may also work at NTNCWS, so this targeted 
training is improving the operation and maintenance of many more systems than the number of 
operators attending. General topics covered new regulatory requirements, monitoring and 
reporting, communicating with the public, construction permit preparation, and operational 
issues. Special topics change each year and have included “Water Accounting - Audits and 
Leak Detections’’ and "Cleaning Small Diameter Water Mains,” wellhead abandonment, and 
source water protection. In 2011 and 2012, 148 and 132 individuals, respectively, attended at 1 
of 5 sites. In May 2013, 165 individuals attended this training. 

Other small system training starts with "train-the-trainer" sessions conducted by the NCWS staff 
for LHD staff who then train NCWS operators. Topics range from current requirements and 
practices to discussions of new requirements and regulations. 

Training of LHD staff is conducted to inform, explain, and discuss new and updated program 
issues and procedures. This training occurs in many ways, including formal educational events 
and during the program evaluation process. In FY 2013, 35 LHD staff and well drillers attended 
the Annual Groundwater and Wells Fundamental Course. This three-day class consisted of well 
construction standards, abandoned well plugging, drilling records submission, well driller 
responsibilities specific to PWS, and preparation for the well drillers exam. Other trainings 
included: 

• Arsenic in Drinking Water - Small System Operator Training with 59 operators in 
two locations 

• 2013 Michigan Environmental Health Association Annual Education Conference-Over 
200 participants, some of whom are level 5 operators 

Under contract with the ODWMA until December 31, 2013, LHDs provided continuing education 
for the level 5 operators. Staff conducted training for level 5 operators in several locations for 
the 2011-2013 time period where 711 operators attended to get information on how to better run 
their systems, including new regulations, new technologies, and other relevant information. 

The NCWS staff has published a comprehensive study guide for individuals pursuing 
certification to operate an NCWS. It may also be useful for operators of other small CWS. 

Topics range from regulatory authority through source protection and system construction to 
monitoring and operation oversight. The guide is available on the Internet. 

4,6 Security 

The MDEQ, Water Security and Emergency Management Program, is responsive to the various 
federal programs and the needs of the public water systems. Planning, training, and 
coordinating are all a part of the effort to emphasize emergency management for all hazards; 
terrorism and malevolent acts as well as weather-related incidents and accidents. 


13 



Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


The USEPA eliminated the Water Sector Security funding as of FY 2010. However, the USEPA 
Counterterrorism grant was extended until March 31, 2014. 

Security tabletop exercises were completed as of March 31, 2014, in order to expend the 
remaining grant balance. Seventy- two table top exercises (TTXs) were conducted with an 
average evaluation of 4.5 out of 5, strongly agreeing that the TTX was beneficial. District staff 
will continue to be involved in safety and security enhancements through the construction permit 
process and the operation of new systems as well as during inspections. 

4. 7 Enforcement 

Evaluations and compliance information becomes the basis for enforcement. When systems fail 
to return to compliance, escalated enforcement, including ACOs and MDEQ orders, can be 
initiated. 

Before escalated enforcement is used, many systems are encouraged to return to compliance 
before they are assessed fines for violations. Michigan's administrative fines policy for 
monitoring and reporting violations helps enforce timely submittals of monthly operation reports 
(MOR) for systems that employ treatment and timely submittals of the Consumer Confidence 
Report (CCR), water systems have been reporting MORs and CCRs on time with few 
exceptions. Since administrative fines were initiated. No fines have been sought in recent 
years due to disinvestment in this enforcement action due to resource limitations. 

When a fine is not applicable or does not prevent further violations, the ODWMA moves to a 
Notice of Violation and Administrative Consent Order (ACO). District staff prefers technical 
assistance over enforcement to return systems to compliance or to prepare them to meet 
upcoming requirements, especially when options are particularly expensive or when acceptable 
alternatives are not readily available. As a result, only 16 drinking water cases needed further 
enforcement action from FY 2011 through FY 2013. Of these, 13 were handled in the district 
and resolved with compliance schedules. 

A majority of these cases were referred for escalation based on system inadequacies such as 
lack of sufficient capacity, water treatment plant deficiencies, or violations of active consent 
orders. Meeting the revised arsenic standard continues to be particularly difficult for a few small 
water systems that do not treat their water and have raised insufficient funds to install treatment 
to remove arsenic. A few of these cases have been referred to enforcement for failure to meet 
the deadlines and terms of the ACO. Many of the NTNCWS, that have not implemented a 
permanent solution, continue serving bottled water to remove the public health threat under an 
agreement with the ODWMA. 

Privately-owned new CWS are subject to additional requirements to ensure they are able to 
provide an adequate supply of drinking water. Proposed systems must stipulate to certain 
conditions such as: obtain a local government’s refusal to accept ownership of the system; 
establish an escrow account available to the ODWMA for immediate repair or maintenance of 
the system; provide contact information of operation personnel; and agree to seek MDEQ 
approval before transferring ownership. The stipulation ensures private owners understand 
their responsibilities prior to establishing the water system. The ODWMA has increased the 
minimum required escrow amount to $10,000.00, while also eliminating the requirement for new 
water system owners to enter into an ACO with the MDEQ. 


14 



Capacity Development Report to the Governor 2014 


4.8 Electronic Reporting 

The ODWMA is working to develop electronic reporting systems to provide more convenience to 
water systems and more accurate and complete assessment of capacity. The successful 
implementation of the Internet-based reporting system for discharge monitoring reports 
prompted Michigan to expand the project to include electronic Drinking Water Reporting 
(eDWR.) When operational, the eDWR System will provide for online submittal of drinking 
water laboratory results and treatment plant operational data. The collection of data will allow 
the ODWMA to query certain parameters to assess capacity on a systemwide and statewide 
basis. Unfortunately, project implementation has been delayed due to lack of adequate staffing 
in both the Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget and the PWSS 
Program. 

4.9 Summary 

Every three years the ODWMA must report to the Governor on the effectiveness of the CDP. 
This program is effective as evidenced by the high rates of compliance with drinking water 
standards and with monitoring and reporting requirements. An even more critical measure of 
the effectiveness of Michigan’s CDP is the absence of any major waterborne disease outbreaks 
like those that have occurred in neighboring states and provinces. 

Public water systems use a multibarrier approach to provide safe water. This approach begins 
with securing a safe source and continues with constructing quality infrastructure using a sound 
basis of design. This multibarrier approach is maintained by qualified personnel properly 
operating the system and routinely monitoring to confirm that the multibarriers are indeed 
functioning and the integrity of the water system is maintained on a continuous basis. 

District staff periodically assesses the capacity of water systems through sanitary surveys and 
serves as a primary resource as systems address capacity issues. Programs available to 
systems include the DWRF, SWPP, operator training, financial assessments, and technical 
assistance provider services, 

New regulations will continue to challenge water systems. Continuing endeavors to maintain 
TMF capacity will help to meet the challenges of these new regulations.

Friday, Jan. 30, 2015 Phone: (517) 373-8808 

Neeley Sends Letter to Governor 
Concerning Flint Water Crisis 

Legislator asks Gov. Snyder to consider plans to fix water system 

LANSING - State Representative Sheldon Neeley (D-Flint) has sent a letter 
to Gov. Rick Snyder, as well as his chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, and his senior 
advisor, Dick Posthumus, to inform them of the current crisis affecting the city of 
Flint's water supply. Residents have spoken out about the quality of the water, 


i 



calling it unsafe to drink. Photos taken by residents and Flint media have shown 
the water to be brownish in color, with sediment and other foreign bodies 
floating in it. 

"In light of the rising and continuous concerns in the Flint community, it is 
imperative that the governor explores all options in his power to come to the aid 
of the community," Neeley said. 

In the letter, Rep. Neeley asks for an executive decision by the governor to 
forgive Flint's water fund loan balance of nearly $20.8 million so that those funds 
may be used to help the city rebuild the infrastructure as well as provide a cost- 
effective water delivery system. 

With this loan forgiveness, Rep. Neeley explains the city will be able to 
upgrade wastewater treatment processes, improve safe drinking water upgrades 
and maintain a water system that provides better water to the citizens of Flint. 

"The people of Flint elected me to serve them first, and when I see my 
constituents on the verge of civil unrest, I must act swiftly and with passion," 
Neeley said. "I am hopeful this letter will bring the concerns of Flint to Gov. 
Snyder, and that will in turn open a dialogue about what can be done to help the 
community I love so much."

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 

• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 

WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 


• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

Team, 

Please review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint. This incorporates some suggested edits to 
the strong draft from DEQ earlier today. 

Thank you very much. 

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water 
Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint 
water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint’s 
Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 
million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping the city on its 
water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health 
protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. 

I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the 
dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large 
bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff 
issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully 
optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from 
leaching into the water. 


i 



However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines 
or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 
Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and 
plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on 
Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office 
locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the 
Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in 
Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the 
water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing 
baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 
total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level 
of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled 
water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free 
testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at

and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water 
Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint 
water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint’s 
Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 
million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping the city on its 
water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health 
protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. 

I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the 
dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large 
bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff 
issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully 
optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from 
leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines 
or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 
Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and 
plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on 
Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office 
locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the 
Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in 
Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday.

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the 
water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing 
baby formula.

Governor - 

Attached is a summary of the funding recommendations, from the departments, to address the Flint Water 
situation. The total state commitment would be $ 10.4m; $7. 9m of that amount is GF/GP. [The DHHS 
number needs to be verified tomorrow morning , but the final number should be close to this estimate.] 

The funding will address 4 priority areas: 

1 . Provision of filters for residential service; 

2. 50% of the estimated cost to reconnect temporarily to the Detroit Water System; 

3. Funding for testing water samples; and 

4. Other state assistance (e.g., home/school/health facility inspections and follow-up for children 
with elevated blood levels). 

We are preparing a formal supplemental request to transmit to the Legislature tomorrow . I intend to talk with 
Rep. Pscholka and Sen. Hildenbrand about including this funding in HB 4102, the pending supplemental bill 
now awaiting House concurrence. Assuming that they agree, we would ask for final action next week. 

Are you ok proceeding with these numbers?

Residents of Flint, Michigan, to Sue City, State over Lead in Drinking Water 

Natural Resources Defense Council, ACLU of Michigan Start Legal Process to Stop Ongoing Violations of 
the Safe Drinking Water Act 

CHICAGO (November 16, 2015) - Residents of Flint, Mich., together with the ACLU of Michigan and the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, today announced their intention to sue state and city officials for 
ongoing violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act amid the city’s widespread lead-contamination 
crisis. A lawsuit would force officials to address repeated, systemic failures to follow federal rules 
designed to protect the public health from dangerous levels of lead exposure. 


l 



“The community of Flint is strong and united in our commitment to repair the harm lead exposure has 
inflicted on our children and families. We are taking a stand so that our community can heal the damage 
that has been done and work together so that justice can prevail,” said Pastor Allen Overton, a leader of 
the Concerned Pastors for Social Action. 

“This action is about holding the government accountable for failing to protect the public health of an 
entire community,” said Anjali Waikar, an environmental justice staff attorney at the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. “This case also highlights a troubling trend in which the government is willing to cut 
costs at the expense of its most vulnerable citizens,” Waikar said. 

“In their short-sighted effort to save a buck, the leaders who were supposed to be protecting Flint’s 
citizens instead left them exposed to dangerously high levels of lead contamination,” said Michael 
Steinberg, legal director for the ACLU of Michigan. “Not only were the city and state’s actions dangerous 
and misguided. They were illegal, too.” 

Dangerous amounts of lead leached out of the city’s pipes and into the drinking water of Flint’s homes 
and schools for more than a year following a decision by Flint officials to eschew Detroit's water supply in 
favor of using the Flint River as the City’s primary drinking water source. Not long after the switch, 
residents began to complain about the smell and discoloration of the water and, later, physical ailments 
stemming from the tainted water. 

Officials working on behalf of Flint insisted for several months that the water was safe. However, water 
tests conducted by experts from Virginia Tech proved those assurances to be wrong, and a study by a 
local pediatrician that showed that the proportion of Flint kids with elevated blood lead levels had doubled 
since the City switched water sources. After officials could no longer deny that the community’s drinking 
water was contaminated, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder finally conceded that Flint should stop using the 
river water and return to the Detroit water system. 

Despite this move, though, city and state officials have continued to violate federal legal requirements for 
monitoring and sampling tap water for lead, notifying the public about water-testing results and 
maintaining corrosion control from Flint’s lead pipes. 

"So much irreparable harm has been done as a direct result of the failures and lack of oversight 
perpetrated by the City of Flint and Michigan officials who are the very people we relied on to keep us 
safe. This lawsuit gives me hope that this will stop and no other city will have to endure the physical, 
property, and emotional damage that Flint residents have," said Melissa Mays of Water You Fighting For, 
a Flint-based organization. 

There is no safe level of lead exposure. The toxic effects of lead on virtually every system in the body, 
and particularly on the developing brains of young children, are well documented. It can also contribute to 
high blood pressure and other health problems in adults. Even low levels of lead in the blood have been 
shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue was served on behalf of Concerned Pastors for Social Action, an association 
of religious leaders from Flint; Melissa Mays, a Flint resident; the ACLU of Michigan; and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. The groups assert that since April 2014, the City of Flint and Michigan state 
officials have failed to monitor and control for lead in Flint’s drinking water and maintain a program to 
assist Michigan schools with lead testing and remediation, in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water 
Act. If City of Flint and Michigan state officials - including Governor Rick Snyder and Dan Wyant, Director 
of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality - do not remedy violations under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act within sixty days, the groups intend to file a lawsuit in federal court. 

Flint and state officials have known since 201 1 that choosing the Flint River as a drinking water source 
could result in lead contamination issues, due to its highly corrosive properties. Yet state and city officials 
insisted that the water was safe to drink - even after testing found dangerously high lead levels in some 
residents’ tap water. Citizen concerns about high lead levels were dismissed by state and city officials as 
“near hysterical]” and “irresponsible,” despite well-established evidence that there is no safe level of lead 
exposure, and that even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay 
attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible.

The Notice of Intent to Sue is required under the Safe Drinking Water Act as a prerequisite to filing suit.

water was contaminated, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder finally conceded that Flint should stop using the 
river water and return to the Detroit water system. 

Despite this move, though, city and state officials have continued to violate federal legal requirements for 
monitoring and sampling tap water for lead, notifying the public about water-testing results and 
maintaining corrosion control from Flint’s lead pipes. 

"So much irreparable harm has been done as a direct result of the failures and lack of oversight 
perpetrated by the City of Flint and Michigan officials who are the very people we relied on to keep us 
safe. This lawsuit gives me hope that this will stop and no other city will have to endure the physical, 
property, and emotional damage that Flint residents have," said Melissa Mays of Water You Fighting For, 
a Flint-based organization. 

There is no safe level of lead exposure. The toxic effects of lead on virtually every system in the body, 
and particularly on the developing brains of young children, are well documented. It can also contribute to 
high blood pressure and other health problems in adults. Even low levels of lead in the blood have been 
shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue was served on behalf of Concerned Pastors for Social Action, an association 
of religious leaders from Flint; Melissa Mays, a Flint resident; the ACLU of Michigan; and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. The groups assert that since April 2014, the City of Flint and Michigan state 
officials have failed to monitor and control for lead in Flint’s drinking water and maintain a program to 
assist Michigan schools with lead testing and remediation, in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water 


2 



Act. If City of Flint and Michigan state officials - including Governor Rick Snyder and Dan Wyant, Director 
of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality - do not remedy violations under the Safe Drinking 
Water Act within sixty days, the groups intend to file a lawsuit in federal court. 

Flint and state officials have known since 201 1 that choosing the Flint River as a drinking water source 
could result in lead contamination issues, due to its highly corrosive properties. Yet state and city officials 
insisted that the water was safe to drink - even after testing found dangerously high lead levels in some 
residents’ tap water. Citizen concerns about high lead levels were dismissed by state and city officials as 
“near hysterical]” and “irresponsible,” despite well-established evidence that there is no safe level of lead 
exposure, and that even low levels of lead in the blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay 
attention, and academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

The Notice of Intent to Sue is required under the Safe Drinking Water Act as a prerequisite to filing suit.

Concerned Pastors for Social Action is an association of religious leaders from more 
than thirty churches and ministries in the Flint area that has advocated for the rights of the 
underserved for nearly fifty years. Melissa Mays is a Flint resident whose family has 
suffered from serious health problems as a result of the City’s failure to provide safe drinking 
water. The ACTU of Michigan works in courts, legislatures, and communities to preserve 
the protections that our laws guarantee to all citizens. NRDC is a national membership 
organization committed to protecting public health and the environment and to reducing 
the exposure of all communities to toxic chemicals. These groups and individuals continue 
to be harmed by the violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act by the City and Michigan 
state officials, detailed below. 

I. City and State officials have exposed and continue to expose Flint residents to 

dangerous amounts of lead in drinking water 

A. The City, Emergency Manager, and State Treasurer chose the Flint River 
as a primary drinking-water source 

In the fall of 20 1 1 , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency 
in the City of Flint and appointed an emergency manager to take control of the City’s 
operations and finances. 2 Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and the City Council were stripped of 
all authority except as specifically allowed by the Emergency Manager, and the City was 
placed in state receivership. 3 Under Michigan’s Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act, an

Emergency Manager has “broad powers” to “rectify the financial emergency and to assure 
fiscal accountability of the local government.” 4 

While under control of the Emergency Manager, the City faced decisions about the 
future of its drinking-water supply. For fifty years, the City had purchased drinking water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit), which sources water from 
Lake Efuron. 5 In response to rising water rates charged by Detroit, in March 2013, the City 
Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a newly formed municipal 
water supply system. The KWA was planning to build a pipeline to distribute water directly 
from Lake Huron to mid-Michigan communities, including Genesee County, where Flint is 
located. 6 The City Council’s vote did not become effective until several weeks later, after 
both the Emergency Manager and State Treasurer approved the decision. 7 

The City’s contract with Detroit was set to expire in April 2014, at least eighteen 
months before the KWA pipeline was scheduled to be completed. 8 Faced with a year-and-a- 
half gap in the City’s water supply, the Emergency Manager declined to negotiate a short- 
term contract with Detroit and decided instead to use the Flint River as a primary drinking- 
water source. 9 The City had previously explored — and rejected — the Flint River as a 
primary drinking-water source. This is because the Flint Water Treatment Plant would have 
required fifty million dollars in upgrades to treat the river water and “produce finished water 
in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water regulations.” 10

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule, Flint’s water system 
could not use the Flint River as a water source without first obtaining approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The Lead and Copper Rule 
required MDEQ to approve both the City’s proposed addition of a new water source (the 
Flint River) and the long-term change in water treatment (from treatment through Detroit’s 
water plant to treatment at the Flint Water Treatment Plant). 11 In April 2014, MDEQ 
approved the switch to river water. 12 The City immediately began pumping Flint River 
water through the City’s distribution pipes and into residents’ taps. 

B. Dangerous lead contamination results from the City's switch to river water 

In the twenty months following the switch in water sources, residents’ drinking water 
has been at times cloudy, discolored, and foul-smelling. 13 Residents reported that they have 
experienced hair loss, skin rashes, and vomiting after drinking the water. 14 In the summer of 
2014, the City was forced to issue several boil-water notices after tap water tested positive 
for total coliform bacteria. 15 The City’s subsequent treatment of the water to kill disease- 
carrying pathogens resulted in elevated levels of total trihalo methanes, a disinfection 
byproduct that can cause serious health problems, including an increased risk of cancer. 16

Because Flint River water is also highly corrosive, dangerous amounts of lead began 
to leach out of pipes and into the City’s drinking water. 17 Lead in drinking water occurs 
primarily from corrosion of pipes and other plumbing materials that contain lead or lead 
solder. 18 The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to manage lead levels by 
controlling corrosion, which is often accomplished by adding corrosion-inhibiting 
chemicals. 19 Water systems must implement and maintain an “optimal” corrosion-control 
treatment program that “minimizes the lead . . . concentrations at users’ taps.” 20 

Flint did not consider how to control the corrosivity of the river water before 
switching water sources, nor did MDEQ require the City to implement any corrosion- 
control measures. Rather, beginning in April 2014, the City did not use any form of 
treatment to control corrosion. 21 The City waited until after its residents were drinking the 
river water to assess whether it posed a risk of increased lead exposure. MDEQ endorsed 
this approach. In June 2014, Flint’s water system initiated the first of two six-month 
monitoring periods to test tap water for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule; the second 
six-month period ran from January to June 2015. 22 During these monitoring periods, the 
water system used flawed testing methods that appear to have been designed to underreport 
the lead content of residents’ drinking water. 23

Flint’s monitoring data showed that some residents’ water contained lead at 
concentrations above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion (ppb). 24 These high 
lead levels put residents at risk of abroad array of serious, irreversible health effects, 
including cognitive impairment, kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. 25 When the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) learned of these high lead sampling results in 
February 2015, it notified MDEQ officials that the sampling results raised significant 
concerns about corrosion from lead pipes in Flint’s distribution system. 26 Nonetheless, 
throughout the monitoring periods, the City and MDEQ maintained that these high lead 
levels were isolated and that the data, taken together, demonstrated Flint’s compliance with 
the Lead and Copper Rule. 27 

C. Community advocacy and independent testing prompt long past due 
response from City and State officials 

As the City concluded its second six-month round of sampling in July 2015, and 
notified some Flint residents of elevated lead levels in their tap water, the community 
became increasingly concerned. A small coalition of local groups, including Water You 
Fighting For and Concerned Pastors for Social Action, began working with researchers at 
Virginia Tech to conduct their own lead sampling of Flint’s water. The Virginia Tech 
scientists found that ten percent of the more than 250 samples collected from Flint 
residences had lead levels of 25 ppb or more, well above the federal action level for lead. 28 
Several samples exceeded 100 ppb, and one sample exceeded 1000 ppb. 29 Though aware of

the Virginia Tech sampling results, MDEQ officials continued to insist that Flint’s water 
was safe to drink. 30 

In September 2015, a medical study conducted by a local pediatrician confirmed the 
kinds of adverse health impacts that residents had voiced concern about for months: the rate 
of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels had nearly doubled since the City changed 
its drinking-water source. 31 State officials and the Governor reacted by “downplaying] and 
in some cases attempting] to discredit” the pediatrician’s findings, and dismissing citizen 
concerns as “near-hysteri[cal].” 32 

Subsequent testing by MDEQ revealed that at least four schools in Flint had lead 
levels in their drinking water above the federal action level. 33 At Freeman Elementary 
School, water tested had lead levels over 100 ppb, more than six times the federal action 
level. 34 This increase in lead exposure is particularly dangerous in Flint, a community where 
residents are already at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels and lead poisoning. 
Michigan ranks fifth worst in the country for harmful exposures to lead. 35 Tow income is a 
risk factor for lead poisoning, and more than a third of families in Flint live below the 
poverty level, three times the national average. 36 Children in Flint also face high risk of lead

exposure from lead-paint dust, as nearly ninety percent of Flint’s housing stock was built 
before 1978 (when the federal ban on high-lead paint went into effect). 37 

Finally, in late September 2015, the City abandoned its assertions that Flint’s 
drinking water was safe. Nearly seven months after the City first saw dangerously high 
levels of lead in some residents’ water, Flint issued a drinking-water advisory and called for 
state financial assistance to switch the water system back to Detroit’s supply. 38 Two weeks 
later, Governor Snyder requested six million dollars from the state legislature to reconnect 
the Flint water system to Detroit. 39 With additional funding from the City and a private 
foundation, the switch was completed in mid-October. 40 

Following the switch back to Detroit water, some government officials began to ask 
questions about what went wrong in the course of Flint’s change in water sources. 41 
Governor Snyder created a task force to review water management and testing in Flint, 42 
and EPA established its own task force “to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through 
regular conversations” with the City and MDEQ. 43 Governor Snyder has also announced

plans to launch an “education campaign soon to help schools statewide learn how to get 
their water tested” for lead. 44 

Despite this proliferation of task forces and campaigns, neither the City nor MDEQ 
has announced changes in the City’s lead monitoring practices in the wake of Flint’s public- 
health crisis. Rather, Flint and MDEQ have maintained that these practices are accurate 
and adequate, despite the near certainty that they are underrepresenting lead contamination 
in many of Flint’s high-risk homes. 

II. City and State officials are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Lead 

and Copper Rule 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act) authorizes citizens to sue any governmental 
entity “who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement” under the statute. 45 These 
requirements include the national primary drinking-water regulations for lead and copper 
set forth in the Dead and Copper Rule. 46 The Lead and Copper Rule obligates water systems 
to monitor and control for lead in drinking water. 47 

Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has failed to comply with the Lead and 
Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring water for lead, notifying the public of tap-water 
monitoring results, reporting monitoring results to MDEQ, and controlling corrosion from 
lead pipes. 48 These violations systematically result in the City’s underestimating lead levels 
in its drinking water, masking a public-health crisis. The violations are ongoing and likely to 
recur in the future: Flint’s water system presently is obligated to monitor for lead every six 
months, and there is no indication that Flint has changed or disavowed its inadequate 
approach to monitoring. 49 


44 See Lori Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 13,

47 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 141.86. 

48 Flint’s water system is subject to the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule because it is a 
“community water system” not otherwise exempted from the regulations. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(a)(1), 
141.2. 

49 See Tamaska v. City of Bluff City, 26 F. App’x 482, 485 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Chesapeake Bay 
Found, v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, 844 F.2d 170, 171-72 (4th Cir. 1988)). A water system is required to 
monitor tap water for lead every six months if it (1) exceeds the action level for any monitoring 
period, or (2) “fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within tire range of values for tire 
water quality parameters specified by the State ... for more than 9 days in any six-month period.” 40 
C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). Flint’s water system failed to maintain applicable values of 
orthophosphate and/or pH designated as the optimal water quality parameters by MDEQ. In 
addition, had the water system conducted monitoring in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule 
during the January to June 2015 period, it likely would have exceeded the lead action level.

Under the Act, a “supplier of water” is “any person who owns or operates a public 
water system.” 50 The City of Flint owns Flint’s water system. 51 Upon information and belief, 
the State officials administering Flint’s receivership and the City presently operate Flint’s 
water system. As discussed above, Flint’s Emergency Manager exercised the authority of 
the local government in the place of Flint’s mayor and city council. The Emergency 
Manager managed the water system and conducted its affairs, including making the 
decision to use the Flint River as a primary drinking-water source. 52 In April 2015, 

Governor Snyder removed the Emergency Manager and appointed a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board to oversee the City’s affairs until the receivership is terminated. 53 
The Board has control over the City’s budget, and must approve all decisions adopted by the 
City Council. 54 The Michigan Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act requires the State 
Treasurer to sit on a receivership transition advisory board for any municipality for which 
the governor appoints such a board, and Governor Snyder has appointed the State Treasurer 
(or his designee) to chair Flint’s Board. 55 The City Administrator reports to the Board, 
manages the City’s daily administrative operations, and directs City department heads in 
carrying out the daily activities of the City. 56 To date, the City remains in receivership, and 
its actions remain subject to approval of the Board. 57

and Beverly Walker-Griffea, Members of the Board; and Natasha Henderson, Flint City 
Administrator, are responsible for the violations of the Act by Flint’s water system which 
have endangered and will continue to endanger the health of Flint’s residents. 

A. Flint's water system is in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule's tap- 
water monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements 

The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify a pool of sampling 
sites prior to the commencement of a monitoring period. 58 This requirement is designed to 
target residences at high risk of lead contamination in drinking water, such as homes served 
by lead service lines. 59 In violation of the Rule, Flint’s water system does not select sampling 
sites for lead monitoring based on a pre-established sampling pool. For Flint’s most recent 
completed monitoring period, January- June 2015, the Director of the City’s Department of 
Public Works admitted that Flint “thr[ew] bottles out everywhere just to collect as many 
[samples] as we can, to try and hit our number.” 60 Similarly, email correspondence shows 
that the City has, during several monitoring periods, asked its own employees to submit tap- 
water samples, without regard to whether the employees were part of a pre-selected 
sampling pool. 61 

Under the Lead and Copper Rule, water systems that contain lead service lines also 
must draw fifty percent of their tap-water samples from sites served by a lead service line. 62 
Flint’s water system does not comply with this requirement. The water system reported to 
MDEQ that all the sample sites it used during the January-June 2015 monitoring period 
were residences served by lead service lines. 63 Flint’s Utilities Administrator, however, 
admitted that he was not able to verify that all homes sampled were served by lead service 
lines. 64 This is because City records concerning the locations of lead service lines in the 
distribution system are stored on 45,000 paper notecards. Flint began converting these 
notecards into an electronic spreadsheet this fall, well after the January-June 2015 
monitoring period. 65

Flint’s water system has also failed to sample the same sites across monitoring 
periods or document the reasons for declining to sample the same sites, as the Lead and 
Copper Rule requires. 66 Sampling new sites from one monitoring period to the next is 
permitted only if a site “is no longer accessible” to the water system or “no longer fits the 
requirements of a priority site.” 67 Records show that in the January-June 2015 monitoring 
period, Flint’s water system retested only thirteen of the one hundred sites it sampled in the 
previous monitoring period. 68 It did not provide the required explanation for these 
departures from the previous monitoring period’s sampling sites. 69 Upon information and 
belief, Flint’s water system concentrated its monitoring in areas where it anticipated low 
lead levels, due to recent infrastructure improvements, and selectively retested sites that had 
previously yielded low lead levels. Such selective sampling violates the Lead and Copper 
Rule’s intention that water systems “do not use only those sampling locations with the 
lowest lead or copper levels.” 70 

Flint’s instructions to residents for the collection of tap-water samples also violate the 
Lead and Copper Rule. The Rule allows residents to collect the tap-water samples used to 
monitor lead in drinking water, so long as the water system instructs residents of the 
sampling procedures required by the regulations. 71 Tap-water samples must be “first-draw 
samples,” meaning that the sample must be collected after water in the tap has stood 
motionless in the plumbing system for at least six hours. 72 Flint’s instructions direct 
residents to flush their taps for five minutes prior to letting the water sit for the six required 
hours. This “pre-flushing” has been shown to “result in the minimization of lead capture 
and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water.” 73 The water system’s pre- 
flush instruction “negates the intent of the [Lead and Copper Rule] to collect compliance

samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions,” 74 and goes “against the intent of the monitoring 
protocol, since it changes the normal water use of the homeowners in the sample.” 75 

Flint’s water system is violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s reporting requirements 
by representing to MDEQ that Flint’s monitoring practices are in compliance with the Rule. 
The City’s water system did not provide documentation to MDEQ justifying its selection of 
new sample sites in the January-June 2015 monitoring period, and, upon information and 
belief, is not accurately reporting information concerning whether sampled sites meet 
required regulatory criteria. 76 

The Lead and Copper Rule also requires Flint’s water system to notify each resident 
whose tap water was sampled of the lead results. 77 Upon information and belief, Flint has 
failed and continues to fail to properly notify all residents whose tap water was tested for 
lead of the individual monitoring results. 

B. Flint's water system has failed to maintain optimal corrosion-control 
treatment 

The Lead and Copper Rule required all large public water systems, including Flint’s 
water system, to install an “optimal corrosion control treatment” program by January 1 , 

199 7. 78 After a system has optimized its corrosion-control treatment, the regulations require 
the system to “continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 79 
Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has not maintained an optimal corrosion-control 
treatment program. Historically, the water system complied with the corrosion-control 
requirements by purchasing treated water from Detroit. When Flint switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, it did nothing to treat the Flint River water to 
control corrosion. This failure to maintain optimized corrosion control violates the Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

Although Flint’s water system has resumed its purchase of treated water from 
Detroit, it has not disavowed its erroneous interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule’s 
corrosion-control requirements. Nor has it committed to maintaining optimized corrosion 
control when it switches water sources again this summer to the KWA pipeline. Flint’s 
water system’s failure to maintain an optimized corrosion-control treatment program is 
likely to recur in the future.

III. The State of Michigan's failure to maintain a schools testing and remediation 
program violates the Safe Drinking Water Act 

The Act requires each state to establish a program “to assist” schools and day care 
centers in “testing for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water.” 80 Test results 
must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 81 Michigan, 
upon information and belief, does not maintain a program for school lead testing, 
remediation, and notification. 82 Accordingly, Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Wyant 
are presently in violation of the Act’s schools provision. 83 

IV. Intent to Sue 

The City of Flint and Michigan state officials have been and continue to be in 
violation of the Tead and Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring and sampling tap 
water for lead, notifying the public of and reporting to the State tap-water monitoring 
results, and corrosion control. Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant are in 
violation of the Act’s requirement to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with 
testing and remediating lead in school drinking water. These violations are likely to 
continue and to recur in the future absent a judicial decree ordering City and State officials 
to comply with the Act. If the City of Flint and the Michigan state officials identified above 
fail to cure their noncompliance with the Act within sixty days, Concerned Pastors for 
Social Action, Melissa Mays, ACLU of Michigan, and NRDC will file suit in federal 
district court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and litigation costs, as appropriate.

Absolutely, ! think that is Jarrod's recommendation to the Gov also but he'll have to confirm that. It's worth noting that 
Wayne Workman met with Natasha Henderson (the city manager we put in and a less than stellar choice) and toid her 
that she needs to find an accommodation with the Mayor or she's out. By the way, Wayne Workman announced his 
retirement yesterday effective Feb. 1, so the guy who is the most knowledgeable and most talented Treasury bureaucrat 
we have (alongside of whizbang Tom Saxton) is quitting. That is a heck of a hole to fill, so we need to encourage Torn to 
stay (he's wavering).

I know just enough about the Flint situation to be dangerous so if the following doesn't make sense let me know. I have 
talked to both Senator Ananich and Representative Neely. They like the Governor and appreciate his efforts in 
Flint. However, they believe because of the combination of the water issue, the "take over" issue, and the approach 
that Darnell and/or the city manager is taking that it has created a great deal of animosity in Flint. I asked Rep. Neely if 
the Governor could only do one thing what would you have him do to improve the situation. He said to give the new 
mayor the ability to appoint some of her own executive staff (legal counsel, etc) that aren't involved with the finances 
(much like we did in Detroit). Is this something we should consider?

Dick, 

Yes, totally agree. Harvey & Wayne have already made some good headway on this topic. They've been working to free 
up the flexibility for the new Mayor to appoint some of her own senior staff. 

The new Mayor was also in here today to meet with MSP and DEQ -- so Harvey might be able to share more on the 
progress.

Absolutely. I think that is Jarrod's recommendation to the Gov also but he'll have to confirm that. It's 
‘worth noting that Wayne Workman met with Natasha Henderson (the city manager we put in and a less

out. By the way, Wayne Workman announced his retirement yesterday effective Feb. I, so the guy who 
is the most knowledgeable and most talented Treasury bureaucrat we have (alongside of whizbang Torn 
Saxton) is quitting. That is a heck of a hole to fill, so we need to encourage Torn to stay (he's wavering).

Subject: Flint 

I know just enough about the Flint situation to be dangerous so if the following doesn't make sense let 
me know. I have talked to both Senator Ananich and Representative Neely. They like the Governor and 
appreciate his efforts in Flint. However, they believe because of the combination of the water issue, the 
"take over" issue, and the approach that Darnell and/or the city manager is taking that it has created a 
great deal of animosity in Flint. I asked Rep. Neely if the Governor could only do one thing what would 
you have him do to improve the situation. He said to give the new mayor the ability to appoint some of 
her own executive staff (legal counsel, etc) that aren't involved with the finances (much like we did in 
Detroit). Is this something we should consider?

Here is a statement from the Governor that will go out around 2-2:30 p.m. to the media. Well also give 
a heads up to executive staffers and some others. - Meegan 


When I became aware that the city of Flint's water showed elevated lead levels and that the state's 
handling of the situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority and appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and 
areas for improvement. 


l 




The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of 
Flint, Genesee County, state and federal officials. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, it has made me aware of some interim 
findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the 
state keeps its citizens safe and informed. 

We'll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their 
concerns. 

In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I've determined that it's 
appropriate to accept it. I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited 
by the task force. 

But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the 
scientific community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and 
Health and Human Services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our 
partners in helping us improve Flint water. Let's share research on water and blood lead level testing so 
we can arrive at accurate and mutually supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that 
we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe drinking water and that 
we're taking steps to protect their health over the short and long term. 

I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan 
citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an 
aging infrastructure. 

I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That's why I'm taking the actions 
today to ensure a culture of openness and trust. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, 
distribute water filters, and help in other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're 
going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our 
task force. When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything 
we can to protect the well-being of our citizens.

DRAFT: A Proposal to Create the Flint Water Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Committee (FWIACC) 


Statement of Need 

To better coordinate resources and personnel and react with urgency, Harvey Hollins and MSP Capt. 
Chris Kelenske have been tasked with creating FWIACC, subject to the approval and endorsement by 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. 

We are also recommending, by executive order, that Gov. Rick Snyder authorizes this committee to help 
restore safe water in Flint and coordinate efforts addressing health/behavioral consequences from lead 
ingestion. 

This inter-agency group will fully engage with all stakeholders committed to solving Flint water issues. 
Equal partners. Equal leadership. Equal responsibility. Equal chance to be part of the solution to an 
important and not fully understood problem. 

FWIACC will be facilitated by Hollins and Kelenske, who represent statewide resources and 
constituencies, with support from senior members of the Governor's office. 

An overview of FWIACC's goals: 

• Create a routine information process between all parties. 

• Pursue other avenues of funding, including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• Implement without delay any appropriate mechanisms that are called for in the Emergency 
Management Act or the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. These may include 
local emergency operations plans and guides. 

Action Plan 

Immediately, FWIACC will: 

1 . Establish an interagency workgroup described in the attached organizational chart. It will be 
comprised of DHHS, MDEQ, MSP, Treasury, Genesee County, City of Flint, MDE, LARA and external 
subject matter experts (SMEs). Other entities may be added as needed. Personnel must be goal- 
oriented, transparent with findings, and able to accomplish FWIACC Incident Action Plan items 
created by the state in a timely manner. The FWIACC plan would be created with city, county, state 
and federal needs in mind. 

2. Assemble staff with competencies in disaster/emergency planning, operations and finance as 
outlined under the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Staff will be accountable to the 
FWIACC leadership to track resource requests and document progress on the FWIACC incident 
action plan. 

3. Utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as appropriate. 

4. Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive and legislative levels as 
determined appropriate. 

5. Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 



Interagency Workgroup Objectives 


1 . Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 

■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to all stakeholders and interested parties. 

■ Create logistics for distributing water and filters, particularly to homebound citizens. 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods, nutrition education and protocols for monitoring, 
neurodevelopmental screening, access to DBP specialists and 
psychologists/psychiatrists, expanded county services, etc. 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community. 

■ Identify existing public information outlets within the city, county and state, 
including schools, churches and other formal and informal distribution networks. 

■ Establish a Joint Information Center. 

■ Provide for emergency alerts and updates. 

■ Determine the process for approving official information before it's disseminated. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water 
system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 

■ Develop priorities, costs and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades 
as part of a long term recovery plan. 

■ Seek partners to assist (NGOs, Foundations, Business, etc.). 

■ Implement the plan.

To: Mayor Karen Weaver 
From: Harvey Hollins 

Governor Snyder and several members of his team do not believe we can wait for the necessary 
documentation for FEMA to act on any emergency declaration - and that an action plan should be fired 
up now by our State and Local entities and bring together agencies and stakeholders that need to 
communicate and coordinate more effectively regarding next steps and resources. 

Our working draft title is the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee (FWIACC), and it would 
immediately address ways at every level to restore safe water and monitor/mitigate the effects of the 
lead. 

In addition to Governor Snyder, the key officials working on this blueprint were MSP Capt. Chris 
Kelenske, DHHS Chief Deputy Tim Becker, DHHS Director Nick Lyon, Rich Baird and myself. The need for 
engaged central coordination has also been recommended by the Governor's Flint Water After-Action 
Task Force, of which Dr. Larry Reynolds is a member. Governor Snyder has endorsed this approach and 
has asked me to provide you with a draft copy in advance of your meeting with him on January 7. If you 
agree, we will organize this committee immediately, and the Governor will issue an executive order to 
authorize FWIACC to work on the issue for the long term . 

As you know, there is a significant amount of work to be done before the Federal government will 
approve an emergency declaration under the Emergency Management Act. FWIACC could begin its 
work immediately and would be in place to complement, not replace any action group ultimately 
formed by an emergency declaration. And we believe it would demonstrate how to best leverage 
essential support addressing manmade emergencies like this, since existing laws are more oriented 
toward natural disasters. 

We brainstormed who should be included in this initial emergency response, with the idea that you and 
other stakeholders may have recommendations on others who need to be added. 

You will note the organization chart and the proposal description is not a normal hierarchical entity. 

This is a collaborative, stakeholder-driven partnership. Chris and I would facilitate it, but it is a 
partnership of city, county and state viewpoints, and would include outside experts like Marc Edwards 
and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. 

All parties will be required to be transparent about their ideas and findings, agreeing to accountability 
measures and reporting on them on a regular basis. 

Please let me know your thoughts on this approach and also other agenda items you wish to see on 
January 7. If you agree, we would also invite the interim DEQ director, Keith Creagh, and the newly 
appointed spokesperson to meet you then.

Re: Neely 


Please keep in mind that while the switch to the Flint River was made by the EM, that decision would have 
never been an option if the city voted down the option to leave DWSD to construct a new pipeline and join 
KWA. The proposal to leave DWSD was passed by a 7-1 vote of the Flint city council where then councilman 
Neely voted yes, then was appointed to the KWA. 

Politically, I believe he keeps this up. I rather just stay the course, we will not be able to reel Neely 

in. However, before the EO is signed, I think it would be important for the Governor to brief several legislators, 

Neely and Ananich being two. 

In the meantime, we should focus on positioning the Mayor a the local leader on this issue. 

Best,

allocated so far, the action plan that has increased testing an provided filters, the work of the task force or even the

They are allowing me to provide a statement, which ill send shortly.

DEQ Internal Changes 

Dick, 


From: 

Sent: 

To: 

Subject: 


Here’s the talking points & messaging from DEQ on the internal changes announced 
today. 


DEQ Director Dan Wyant today made the following statement as he announced 
DEQ Chief Deputy Jim Sygo will immediately assume the role of interim chief of 
the department's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance: 

"It recently has become clear that our drinking water program staff made a mistake 
while working with the City of Flint. Simply stated, staff employed a federal protocol they 
believed was appropriate, and it was not. The water testing steps followed would have 
been correct for a city less than 50,000 people, but not for a city of nearly 100,000. 

As details of the situation emerge, I am convinced our program staff believed they were 
doing their job right. As the state recognized there could be a health threat to Flint 
residents, we took appropriate steps. We are now embarked on an unprecedented effort 
to safeguard Flint residents and families with near-term, intermediate and long-term 
actions to protect and educate city residents. 

The issue in DEQ is experience and protocol with respect to corrosion control. The 
Governor has called for an independent, third-party after-action review. I have taken the 
step of changing leadership in the division. We are working with our federal partners 
and committed to being part of the U.S. EPA's effort to strengthen its Lead and Copper 
rule. 

All who brought this issue to the department deserve credit for bringing it forward. Lead 
is a serious issue, particularly for young people, and we take it seriously. The 
Governor's plan incorporates the suggestions outlined by the EPA and researchers at 
Virginia Tech. 

We will learn from this. We will make necessary changes to see to it that our program 
becomes a national leader in public health protection.” 


KEY MESSAGES: 



1 . It is increasingly dear through internal review at DEQ that staff overseeing drinking 
water mistakenly applied the wrong federal protocol when the city of Flint switched to 
the Flint River. 


2. Today's announcement of new leadership in that division aligns with the states goal: 
make sure the public health is protected in Flint and elsewhere in the state, and ensure 
we learn from this so it never happens again. 


3. The governor's action plan continues to protect kids and families in Flint, with the 
switch back to Detroit water last week, free water filtration for all city residents, and 
inspection of all Flint schools for lead exposure. 


4. Flint families who are concerned are encouraged to take advantage of free home 
water testing through the city and blood lead level testing for children.

December 29, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 



This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 
this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 

A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 


2 



legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 


We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 
time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 

We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDFIFIS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community. 

Respectfully yours.

ABCS 12 Investigates: What's In your water? 

Posted: Jan 29, 2815 3:38 PM EST 
Updated: Jafi 29, 2QT5 11 Mm EST 

By Larry Biiclt CONNECT 


FLINT (WJRT) - (01/29/1 5} - The results are- .m and we now have a completely indepen denOboK at what's in 
Fiini's water supply. 

For months, si nce Flint switched from a Detroit water supply to the Flint River as it’s water source, Flint water 
customers have complained of smelly, cloudy, bad tasting water and biame if for 3 variety of health: 
problems. 

CompSainte exploded earlier this month when Flint notified its water customers that a group of chemicals 
Known as TTHIV1 'were at much higher average levels than allowed by law, 

vyithr so many questions and distrust of the answers, ABpl2‘s Larry Elliott investigates - What's in your 
Water? 

it seems no matter who you ask . in the Flint area, there's a n opinion about the city's water. Mast of the issues 
center on the quality of the water and whether it's safe to drink, 

"Right now it smells," said Fit tit resident Lee Miller, "We're getting water out of our own back yard now arid it's 
costing me double what it was coming from Detroit. ' 

"it has a funny taste to it," said Flint resident Milton Alexander. 

"It could be dangerous to us, actually ! don’t know how dangerous it is," said Fiini resident Shariks Sanders., 

''I’m ha cheerleader for {he water department here, i think we've got a lot of issues to work on," Ken 
VanWagoner, of Good Beans Cafe - Flint, 

Most of the issues center. on the quality of the water and whether it's safe to drink, but concern over its safety, 
reached a new high earlier this month when the city was required by the state Department oi Environmental 
•Duality to notify residents that the water had exceeded the allowable li mit of a group of chemicals known as 
TTHM. 

TTHM is in most municipal water systems and is thought by some to be a possible carcinogen in. long term 
exposure. 

it's a byproduct. of chlonnatido, which is commonly used to help pudiy water, Last August, as- Flint's water 
treatment plant worked to purify the water it was drawing from the Flint River, levels of TTHM grew to weli 
over the EPA allowed maximum. 

August test results provided by the DEQ to ABC 12 show ail of the eight testing sites around Flint had TTHM 
levels well above, thg legal limit; 

The lowest level among the eight sites was .40 percent above the legal limit. The highest was 145 percent

more than allowed. 

DEQ rules only require the city to report higher than allowed levels to the public once a year, and only if the 
average of quarterly tests is higher than the legal limit 

That notification wentout to residents on Jan. 5. Since then, many residents have refused to believe 
assurances from the DEQ and the city that the water is now safe to drink. 

So, we set out to do complete and independent testing to find out for ourselves exactly what's in yourwater. 

It took a bit of research, but we finally found Water Tech, in Howell, a testing lab with absolutely no ties to 
Flint, just to make sure there are no questions about the test results. 

After having Water Tech train ABC12's Larry Elliott on the proper methods for collecting water samples, we 
set out last week to randomly test five sites in Flint. 

1. Downtown. 

"I'm excited to see this done because this is an independent way to find out that everything's just fine," 
VanWagonersaid. 

2. The north side. 

"We'd like to do kind ofa whole battery oftests of your water. Oh yeah," Alexander said. 

3. The west side. 

"It could be dangerous to us. How about if we help you find out what's in it right now?" Sanders said. 

4. The east side. 

"I'm hoping for a good test and put my family at ease," Miller said. 

5. Our main studio, on the south side. 

We also wanted to compare whatever we're to find with Detroit supplied water, so we took a sample from the 
Burton water system. 

Since next year Flint will connect to the new KWApipeline, getting its waterfrom Lake Huron, we tooka 
comparison sample from the Saginaw-Midland water system, which currently uses Lake Huron water. 

We tested all the sites for levels of TTHM. We also tested how much residual chlorine was in the Flint and 
Burton water supply and more importantly, we tested at two of our Flint sites for a number of other hazardous 
chemicals that could cause skin or other health problems. 

Tests for those other chemicals are not required for public water systems, but we decided to run those tests 
anyway. 

Here's what our independent testing shows: 

All sites tested, including the Saginaw-Midland water system and the Burton system, using Detroit water, 
contained TTHM - butall of them were well below the EPA allowed maximum. 

Saginaw-Midland water had less than a third of the maximum TTHM allowed, the Burton system had only 
about 25 percent ofthe maximum and the highest level found of all of our Flint tests showed just over 65 
percent of whafs allowed, all below EPA limits. 

A similar byproduct of chlorination, haloacetic acids, was also well below EPA maximums in Flint's water. 

We tested Flint’s north and east water samples for many other hazardous chemicals that a doctor told us 
could cause skin or other health problems, and on both tests, not a single one of those chemicals was 
detected. 

Since most often any smell to the water would be caused by levels of total residua! chlorine, we tested that 
too, in both our Fiintand Burton samples. 

The legal limit is 4 milligrams per liter. The average of our Flint samples shows a level of about a half 
milligram per liter. Our test in Burton actually shows 22 percent more residual chlorine than Flint. 

Our Flint sample also showed no Coliform bacteria. 

We asked Chris McCarthy, of Water Tech, a few questions.

Q: How would you describe these test results? 

A: "Well, for the samples received, the tests we performed, everything is within EPA guidelines for safe 
drinking water." 

Q: Is there anything in these results that raises a red flag for you? 

A: "For water quality or water safety, No.” 

We then asked residents if these results change their opinion of what they'll do with their water now. 

"To be honest, no," Alexander said. 

"It will make me feel a lot more comfortable about bathing and brushing my teeth in it, but I'm still not going to 
drink it and I'm not gonna give it to my kids or my dog," Sanders said. 

"It makes me feel a lot more safer, a lot more comfortable knowing that it's safe to drink now, you know. I'll tell 
you a load lifted off my shoulders. When the kids take baths, when my wife takes a shower, you know, I know 
now we're safe," Miller said. 

So what about those whoVe stood before Flint City Council with jugs of discolored water? 

While Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright points out he has no jurisdiction over Flint's water 
system, he says in general, discolored water like this is nearly always the result of water main breaks or 
repairs, and Flint has more than its share because of its aging system. 

Wright also says the KWA pipeline won't change that. It will take better management of repairs and money - 
lots of it- to replace Flint's aging water mains. 

Unfortunately for the city of Flint, those very high levels of TTHM recorded last August in Flint water tests are 
still required by the DEQto be included in the next report calculating average TTHM levels. 

The next test will be done next week, and city Public Works Director Howard Croft tells ABC12, because of 
the high levels last August, the city will again be found in violation and will be required by the DEQto send 
out another TTHM notice of violation to all Flint water customers in early March, even if all new tests show 
levels under the legal limit.

Governor - 

Attached is a summary of the funding recommendations, from the departments, to address the Flint Water 
situation. The total state commitment would be $ 10.4m; $7. 9m of that amount is GF/GP. [The DHH S 
number needs to be verified tomorrow morning, but the final number should be close to this estimate.] 

The funding will address 4 priority areas: 

1 . Provision of filters for residential service; 

2. 50% of the estimated cost to reconnect temporarily to the Detroit Water System; 

3. Funding for testing water samples; and 

4. Other state assistance (e.g., home/school/health facility inspections and follow-up for children 
with elevated blood levels). 

We are preparing a formal supplemental request to transmit to the Legislature tomorrow' . I intend to talk with 
Rep. Pscholka and Sen. Hildenbrand about including this funding in HB 4102, the pending supplemental bill 
now awaiting House concurrence. Assuming that they agree, we would ask for final action next week. 

Are you ok proceeding with these numbers?

Please review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint. This incorporates some 
suggested edits to the strong draft from DEQ earlier today. 

Thank you very much. 

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 
million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million 
and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental 
Quality today also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health 
exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 


i 



provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. 
As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain 
events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great 
Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help 
coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in 
water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are 
available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 
Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., 
Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about 
proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. 
on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap 
and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at

I know just enough about the Flint situation to be dangerous so if the following doesn't make sense let me know. I have 
talked to both Senator Ananich and Representative Neely. They like the Governor and appreciate his efforts in 
Flint. Flowever, they believe because of the combination of the water issue, the "take over" issue, and the approach 
that Darnell and/or the city manager is taking that it has created a great deal of animosity in Flint. I asked Rep. Neely if 
the Governor could only do one thing what would you have him do to improve the situation. He said to give the new 
mayor the ability to appoint some of her own executive staff (legal counsel, etc) that aren't involved with the finances 
(much like we did in Detroit). Is this something we should consider?

1) Meegan & Dave: In an RPA way, make sure the record is correct here. At least all our recent 
actions should be included here. 

2) Is it worth bringing Neely in to explain all we are doing? Or is he going to keep this up no 
matter what?

At some point in time one of the emergency managers, unbeknownst to the city council, made a 
decision that they would start the process and we're going to use the Flint River water as the 
primary source of water, " he said.

Paul, 

You should probably start joining these calls. I only join for the very beginning where we discuss public safety 
and I do not usually say anything, just listen, answer questions or tell them i will get back to them on public 
safety issues that come up in Flint. We originally started this to keep tabs on the previous EM and Chief but the 
existing ones are fantastic and really do not need hand holding. It is helpful for you to hear what they are doing 
though. I always hang up when they move to the financial stuff. Sam can probably reach out to Maxine to add 
you.

contributor to the problem.

severe problems to occur. Pursuing these investigations may include seeking additional

State Action in Flint 


FLINT, Mich. — Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) issued the following statement: 

“My constituents and I believe the state must act urgently to provide concrete solutions to the public health 
crisis in the City of Flint. In speaking with Governor Snyder and his key aides today, I stressed the need to work

“My formal request included immediate and long-term solutions, including strong consideration for switching 
back to the Detroit water source until the Karegnondi Pipeline Authority project is complete. Anything less than 
an aggressive, comprehensive approach is simply unacceptable.”

Dear , 


The Flint water crisis is a failure of government at every level, and I am committed to increasing 
transparency and finding answers to ensure that these failures never happen again. That’s why I 
have called for an investigation into the causes of water problems in Flint, 

Simply put, high lead levels in Flint’s drinking water are unacceptable, and there must be 
accountability. 

As part of my ongoing efforts, I am holding a telephone town hall with constituents on 
Wednesday, October 28th, at 7 pjrs. ET to provide an update on my efforts. I’ll be joined by both 
Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Dr. Marc Edwards, who both conducted critical tests that exposed 
unacceptable lead levels in Flint. On the five call, we will also answer questions from Flint residents. 

if you’re interested in joining our conversation, please RSVP here, or fill out the form below.

For months, I have been pressing state and federal agencies for immediate resources and action to 
improve and restore confidence in water quality. At the federal level, I am pushing for resources to 
ensure the safety of water, but also make much-needed repairs to our city’s aging water system and 
infrastructure. The Flint Journal covered these federal efforts in March. You can view them here. 

Additionally, I welcome the announcement recently that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
will send technical advisors to Flint to assist the city and state. I have repeatedly asked the ERA to 
send these much-needed experts to help improve the water quality and hopefully restore some 
public confidence in the safety of our water. 

Serious issues remain, and there is a long way to go before complete confidence in the city’s 
drinking water is restored. I am committed to working to ensure that Flint residents get a thorough 
investigation and answers to their questions, 

I hope you’ll join me next Wednesday for a telephone town hall update on Flint water.

Neeley Sends Letter to Governor 
Concerning Flint Water Crisis 

Legislator asks Gov. Snyder to consider plans to fix water system 

LANSING - State Representative Sheldon Neeley (D-Flint) has sent a letter 
to Gov. Rick Snyder, as well as his chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, and his senior 
advisor, Dick Posthumus, to inform them of the current crisis affecting the city of 
Flint's water supply. Residents have spoken out about the quality of the water, 
calling it unsafe to drink. Photos taken by residents and Flint media have shown 


i 



the water to be brownish in color, with sediment and other foreign bodies 
floating in it. 

"In light of the rising and continuous concerns in the Flint community, it is 
imperative that the governor explores all options in his power to come to the aid 
of the community," Neeley said. 

In the letter, Rep. Neeley asks for an executive decision by the governor to 
forgive Flint's water fund loan balance of nearly $20.8 million so that those funds 
may be used to help the city rebuild the infrastructure as well as provide a cost- 
effective water delivery system. 

With this loan forgiveness, Rep. Neeley explains the city will be able to 
upgrade wastewater treatment processes, improve safe drinking water upgrades 
and maintain a water system that provides better water to the citizens of Flint. 

"The people of Flint elected me to serve them first, and when I see my 
constituents on the verge of civil unrest, I must act swiftly and with passion," 
Neeley said. "I am hopeful this letter will bring the concerns of Flint to Gov. 
Snyder, and that will in turn open a dialogue about what can be done to help the 
community I love so much."

All- 


Jusf received this from Dave Eggert... 

I am going to tell David that Treasury did send s timely response to the Representative, It was due (following a 
statutory extension) on Tuesday, September 29, 2015. Our response (attachment 1) went in the mail on Tuesday, As you 
will see, it was a "denial/’ as Treasury does not have any records regarding "waivers, permits or applications to use the 
Flint River.,," 

Apparently, the response has not arrived in his (Flushing, Ml) mailbox... or is arriving today. 


I have also attached the extension letter (attachment 2), which was timely-mailed as 'well. 


Let me know if you have any questions...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: Rep. Phil Phelps 

Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015 Phone: (517) 373-7515 


l 



Statement from state Rep. Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) on his FOIA requests 
pertaining to the City of Flint water crisis being denied: 


“Residents of the City of Flint face a substantial health risk due to contaminants found in their 
drinking water. In an effort to not politicize this situation, I have been working directly with 
state and local officials in seeking important information and attempting to correct the City’s 
water crisis. Unfortunately, I have been faced with continual road blocks in my requests for 
information. It has been nearly a month since I submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
requests to the State and the City of Flint requesting to see documents related to the City’s switch 
to using water from the Flint River. I requested the applications and permits required by law to 
change a city’s source of water. So far, the State Treasury has violated FOIA by not providing 
any information or even a denial. The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and City of 
Flint have denied my request saying that the documents I requested do not exist. However, state 
law requires Michigan cities to apply for a permit from the DEQ to switch their source of water. 
Violation of this law is punishable by a fine of $5,000 per day and possible incarceration. I find it 
hard to believe that the DEQ and the City of Flint ignored such a critical step, not to mention one 
that the cost in fines alone would already be roughly $2.5 million and cause those responsible to 
be subject to criminal prosecution. 

“My request for these documents was meant to be a fact-finding mission to ascertain the degree 
to which the State knew about or took any action to determine the potential hazards of making 
this switch prior to being officially ordered by the State-appointed Emergency Manager. Since 
the State has decided not to disclose this information to me, it is unclear the extent to which the 
State is culpable. I believe the bottom line here is that the decision to switch the source of Flint’s 
water to the Flint River was made by the Emergency Manager appointed by Governor Snyder 
and the burden is on his shoulders to make this right. 

“The use of the river water has caused a great amount of destruction to the City’s water 
infrastructure, and it has put the residents who use the water in harm’s way. To help continue this 
fight for information, I have retained attorney Keith D. Flynn of the law firm Miller Cohen 
P.L.C. to further evaluate my legal options. My position and recommendation to the Governor on 
this issue is that the State should immediately switch Flint’s water source back to the Detroit 
Water System at no additional cost to Flint residents and supply water filters to every household 
in Flint. 

“Furthermore, the State should begin to estimate costs for the total damage done to the City’s 
public works infrastructure and for the treatment of potential adverse health outcomes we could 
see in Flint residents in the future and allocate expenditures to correct this problem.”

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention.

Ms. Gina McCarthy 

Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency 
1 1 01 A 

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 

Washington, D.C. 20460 

Dear Administrator McCarthy: 

My office has reached out to both the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations 
at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
to determine if there are any statutory limitations on states to forgive the principal on loans made 
through the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SDWSRF) program. After talking to 
both of these offices, there seems to he a difference in legal opinion between the two 
interpretations as to whether forgiveness of principal is statutorily allowed, and I am requesting 
further clarification. 

The City of Flint, Mich., located in my district, continues to endure prolonged and severe 
financial stress due to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs, resulting in population loss 
and an erosion of its tax base. In an effort to improve the city’s financial stability, Flint decided 
to end its 50-plus-year affiliation with the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department in April 
of 2013. Instead, Flint would become a partner in the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to 
bring raw' water from. Lake Huron to the city. 

The water contract between the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department and Flint was 
terminated in May of 2014,The KWA, however, will not he able to provide water to the city until 
its pipeline from Flint to Lake Huron is completed at the end of 2016. To fill tbs gap in service 
until the KWA is completed, Flint has turned to the Flint River as its current source for raw 
water. The Flint River has proven to have an inconsistent quality because of high levels of 
organic matter. Flint water officials have used high levels of trihaiomethanes to treat the 
occasional elevated levels of organic matter in the water. On December 16, 2014, the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality cited the city for being in violation of water standards 
determined by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) due to high levels of trihaiomethanes. In 
accordance with the SDWA, a cautionary notice about the citation was subsequently sent to 
residents. 



Since its citation, Flint has engaged local and state leaders to find a solution for the poor quality 
of the water. On February 3, 201 5, the state gave the city close to $2 million to hire consultants 
to assess the condition and find leaks in the water infrastructure system. While this binding is a 
step in the right direction, it is not nearly enough to significantly improve the 'water quality. 

This background on Flint's water situation is to point out that the SPWA is intended to improve 
drinking water in America’s cities, such as Flint, by creating water quality standards and funding 
the SDWSRF to invest in water infrastructure. In addition to the high levels of trihalomethanes, 
the poor condition of ' water infrastructure in Flint, regardless of the water’s source, contributes to 
discolored and poor tasting water. Furthermore, Flint currently suffers an over 35 percent loss 
ratio of water between the treatment plant and the end user. In the past, Flint has benefited from 
the SDWSRF and currently has close to $22 million in outstanding loans from it that the city has 
used to repair the water system, The financial stress of making payments on these loans, 
however, has prevented the city from making the necessary ongoing investments to Its water 
infrastructure. 

To decrease the burden of these loans, on January 18, 2015, Flint requested that the state of 
Michigan, as the responsible party in appropriating funds from the SDWSRF to local 
governments, forgive part of the principal The state responded that forgiving the principal is not 
an option as the state does not have die authority to do so. 

In response to the state’s reply, on February 10, 2015, my staff reached out to the Office of 
Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at the EPA to ask if they were aware of any 
statutory language that prevents principal forgiveness of loans made under the SDWSRF. On 
February 25, 201 5, the EPA responded that they “could find ... no provision that would allow a 
state to [forgive an existing loan made from a Safe Drinking Water Act state revolving fund].” 

On February 23, 2015, my staff also reached out to the CRS for their legal opinion on this 
matter. Although they could not find any precedent for doing so, the CRS did find two instances 
in statute that, in their opinion, allows states to forgive the principal on loans made through the 
SDWSRF. 

First, SDWA sec, 1452(4X1), 42 U5C 3 0Oj- 1 2(d)(1), states ™ ‘‘Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, in any case in which the State makes a loan pursuant to subsection 
;(a)(2) of this section to a disadvantaged community the State may provide additional 
subsidization (including forgiveness of principal).” 

Second, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations AN, 2015, Pub. Law 1 13-235, 
states on page 296 - “Provided further, [t|hat not less than 20 percent hut not more than 30 
percent of the foods made available under this title to each State for Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund capitalization grants shall be used by the State to provide additional subsidy to 
eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or 
any combination of these), and shall he so used by the State only where such funds are provided 
as initial financing for an eligible recipient or to buy, refinance, or restructure the debt 
obligations of eligible recipients only where such debt was incurred on or after the date of 



The difference in opinion between EFA and CRS has created ambiguity for the affected parties. 
The ability of states to forgive portions of the principal on loans made through the SDW5RF 
could have a significant impact on the financial state of Flint and many other distressed 
municipalities across the county. I would appreciate clarification from you on what, according to 
EPA’s interpretation of the law, statutoril y prevents states from forgiving the principal on loans 
made under the SDWSRF. 

Due to critical nature of the water quality in Flint and the impact that loan forgiveness could 
have on improving the quality of the water, I ask for your prompt attention to this matter.

Dear , 


The Flint water crisis is a failure of government at every level, and I am committed to increasing 
transparency and finding answers to ensure that these failures never happen again. That's why I 
have called for an investigation into the causes of water problems in Flint. 

Simply put, high lead levels in Flint's drinking water are unacceptable, and there must be 
accountability. 

As part of my ongoing efforts, I am holding a telephone town hall with constituents on 
Wednesday, October 28th, at 7 p.m. ET to provide an update on my efforts, i’ll be joined by both 
Dr. Mona Hanna-Aitisha and Dr. Marc Edwards, who both conducted critical tests that exposed 
unacceptable lead levels in Flint. On the live call, we will also answer questions from Flint residents. 

If you’re interested in joining our conversation, please RSVP here, or fill out the form below.

For months, ! have been pressing state and federal agencies for immediate resources and action to 
improve and restore confidence in water quality. At the federal level, I am pushing for resources to 
ensure the safety of water, but also make much-needed repairs to our city's aging water system and 
infrastructure. The Flint Journal covered these federal efforts in March. You can view them here . 

Additionally, 1 welcome the announcement recently that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
will send technical advisors to Flint to assist the city and state. I have repeatedly asked the ERA to 
send these much-needed experts to help improve the water quality and hopefully restore some 
public confidence in the safety of our water. 

Serious issues remain, and there is a long way to go before complete confidence in the city's 
drinking water is restored. I am committed to working to ensure that Flint residents get a thorough 
investigation and answers to their questions. 

I hope you’ll join me next Wednesday for a telephone town hall update on Flint water.

An Update on Flint's Water

Dear Eric, 

I am writing to make sure you are aware of a Genesee County Health Department health advisory 
that has been issued for people drinking water in the city of Flint, including steps you can take to get 
your water tested and limit your exposure. 

Tests have shown that water in Flint contains high levels of lead. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control , lead is a serious toxin that impacts every organ in the body, including the brain. 
While both children and adults are vulnerable to lead health effects, children under age six and 
pregnant mothers are most at risk. 

Flint residents are encouraged to get their water tested if they are concerned about lead 
contamination. Residents can get their water tested for lead by visiting the city of Flint website 
. .ClA y:C.f f ! : C l : CO rri or by contacting the Flint Water Department at 810-787-6537. 

If you are concerned that you or your children have been exposed to lead, please immediately 
contact your family physician or the Genesee County Health Department at 810-257-3833. Children 
six and under are eligible for free lead tests at the Genesee County Health Department, including 
without health insurance. 


Flint residents can filter their tap water by obtaining a lead-clearing filter certified to meet National 
Sanitation Foundation (NSF) Standard 53 for lead. For more information, the Genesee County 
Health Department has set up a filter distribution hotline at 810-257-2158. 

The Genesee Count y Health Department lias issued the followin g ti p s about how to limit your 
exposure to lead in your water. For more information on understanding the health defects that can 
result from lead contamination and ways to limit its effects on you and your family, please read the 
brochure . here. However, a selection of their suggestions is included below. 


From the 
my tap water? 


t What can I do to reduce or eliminate lead 


Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes. The longer the 
water has been sitting in the pipes , the more lead it may contain. 

You can fill containers for later use, after the flushing process. 





* Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking , cooking , and especially for making baby 
formula. Hoi water is likely to contain higher levels because it dissolves more lead. 

* You may choose to install a water filter that is NSF-certifled for lead removal. 

* If a water filter is installed, replace filters at least as often as recommended by the 
manufacturer. 

* Buy a lead -free faucet. 

» The legal definition of lead-free" still allows brass faucets to contain up to 8 percent lead. 
However, faucets marked with "NSF 81/9" and/or "California Proposition 85" meet stricter 
ilmits. 

* Regularly dean particles from faucet aerators. 


Sincerely, 



Dan Kiidee

The Children of Flint have been poisoned due 
to Rick Snyder's “truly unbelievable, reckless 
radicalism" 


on December 19, 2015 in 




The Flint water crisis was declared 
Weaver this week — something we‘ve kmwn for months . But much of the nation 
still has no idea what has been perpetrated against the people of this battered 
city. 

One person is trying to change that. 

“Governor, the water of the city of Flint, Michigan has been poisoned," 

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow explained on Friday night in an 18-minute segment that 
connects the crime that has been committed against the people of Flint to the 
undemocratic hijacking of local governments through the Emergency Manager 
iawfe) . which she calls “truly unbelievable, reckless radicalism," and the gross 
incompetence of both the emergency managers and the man who appointed them 
— Governor Rick Snyder. 


i 


In trying to explain the reluctance of the national media to cover the lead 
poisoning of Flint, Maddow made analogy to personal health. People want to see 
lead as long-term infrastructure problem, like the inevitable result of a bad diet 
and exercise when whats really happened is much more brutal and inexcusable. 
“This is the personal health equivalent of having been shot," Maddow said. “This 
is not something that went bad over a long period of time. This is... they flipped 
a switch to turn off one spigot last April and turn on a different spigot. And 
the spigot they turned on poisoned the kids. The kids of Flint, Michigan have 
been poisoned by a policy decision. All at once, the town has been poisoned, 
under your watch, Governor through the actions and in-actions of people who 
report to you and the people you appointed."

Governor Rick Snyder 
Executive Office of the Governor 
P.O. Box 30013 
Lansing, Michigan 48909 

Governor Snvder, 

Thank you for your letter on October 2, 2015, regarding the state of Michigan’s plans to respond 
to the crisis regarding the drinking water in Flint, Mich, I encourage you to immediately 
implement the action plan outlined so that Flint residents can have safe drinking water. 

Moreover, you asked for my assistance in working with federal agencies to address this Issue, 
Due to the urgent nature of this issue, 1 want to update you that my staff and I are working 
closely with Senators Stabenow and Peters and have been in communication with the appropriate 
agencies. I will continue to do everything I can to help address this issue at the federal level 

On September 22, 2015, 1 previously wrote letters to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Department of Health and Human Sendees, Centers for Disease Control and Federal Emergency 
Management Agency requesting immediate assistance to provide safe drinking water to Flint, 

in addition, on March 26, 2015, I sent a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
asking them to clarify if there is any statutory limitation on states to forgive the principal on 
loans made through the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. 

Again, thank you for beginning to utilize your office’s resources to help address the water quality 
in Flint. I look forward to working with you on the shared goal of helping the residents of Flint 
have safe drinking water.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention.

Ms. Gina McCarthy 

Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency 
1 1 01 A 

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 

Washington, D.C. 20460 

Dear Administrator McCarthy: 

My office has reached out to both the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations 
at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
to determine if there are any statutory limitations on states to forgive the principal on loans made 
through the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SDWSRF) program. After talking to 
both of these offices, them seems to he a difference in legal opinion between the two 
interpretations as to whether forgiveness of principal is statutorily allowed, and I am requesting 
further clarification. 

The City of Flint, Mich., located in my district, continues to endure prolonged and severe 
financial stress due to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs, resulting in population loss 
and an erosion of its tax base. In an effort to improve the city’s financial stability, Flint decided 
to end its 50-plus-year affiliation with the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department in April 
of 2013. Instead, Flint would become a partner in the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to 
bring raw' water from. Lake Huron to the city. 

The water contract between the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department and Flint was 
terminated in May of 2014,The KWA, however, will not he able to provide water to the city until 
its pipeline from Flint to Lake Huron is completed at the end of 2016. To fill the gap in service 
until the KWA is completed, Flint has turned to the Flint River as its current source for raw 
water. The Flint River has proven to have an inconsistent quality because of high levels of 
organic matter. Flint water officials have used high levels of trihaiomethanes to treat the 
occasional elevated levels of organic matter in the water. On December 16, 2014, the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality cited the city for being in violation of water standards 
determined by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) due to high levels of trihaiomethanes. In 
accordance with the SDWA, a cautionary notice about the citation was subsequently sent to 
residents. 



Since its citation,, Flint has engaged local and state leaders to find a solution for the poor quality 
of the water. On February 3, 2015, the state gave the city close to $2 million to hire consultants 
to assess the condition and find leaks in the water infrastructure system. While this handing is a 
step in the right direction, it is not nearly enough to significantly improve the wafer quality. 

This background on Flint's water situation is to point out that the SDWA is intended to improve 
drinking water in America’s cities, such as Flint, by creating water quality standards and funding 
the SDWSRF to invest in wafer infrastructure. In addition to the high levels of trihalomethanes, 
the poor condition of water infrastructure in Flint, regardless of the water’s source, contributes to 
discolored and poor tasting water. Furthermore, Flint currently suffers an over 35 percent loss 
ratio of water between the treatment plant and the end user. In the past. Flint has benefited from 
the SDWSRF and currently has close to $22 million in outstanding loans from it that the city has 
used to repair the water system. The financial stress of making payments on these loans, 
however, has prevented the city from making the necessary ongoing investments to its water 
infrastructure. 

To decrease the burden of these loans, on January 1 8, 201 5, Flint requested that the state of 
Michigan, as the responsible party in appropriating funds from the SDWSRF to local 
governments, forgive part of the principal. The state responded that forgiving the principal is not 
an option as the state does not have the authority to do so. 

In response to the state’s reply, on February 10, 2015, my staff reached out to the Office of 
Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at the EPA to ask if they were aware of any 
statutory language that prevents principal forgiveness of loans made under the SDWSRF. On 
February 25, 201 5, the EPA responded that they “could find ... no provision that would allow a 
state to [forgive an existing loan made from a Safe Drinking Water Act state revolving fund].” 

On February 23, 2015, my staff also reached out to the CRS for their legal opinion on this 
matter. Although they could not find any precedent for doing so, the CRS did find two instances 
in statute that, in their opinion, allows states to forgive the principal on loans made through the 
SDWSRF. 

First, SDWA sec, 1452(dX.l), 42 USC 300j~ 12(d)(1), states --“Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, in any case in which the State makes a loan pursuant to subsection 
(a)(2) of this section to a disadvantaged community , the State may provide additional 
subsidization (including forgiveness of principal).” 

Second, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. Law 1 13-235, 
states on page 296 <- “Provided further, [i]hat not less than 20 percent but not more than 30 
percent of the fends made available under this title to each State for Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund capitalization grants shall be used by the State to provide additional subsidy to 
eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or 
any combination of these), and shall be so used by the State only where such funds are provided 
as initial financing for an eligible recipient or to buy, refinance, or restructure the debt 
obligations of eligible recipients only where such debt was incurred on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act; 



The difference in opinion between EFA and CRS has created ambiguity for the affected parties. 
The ability of states to forgive portions of the principal on loans made through the SDW5RF 
could have a significant impact on the financial state of Flint and many other distressed 
municipalities across the county. I would appreciate clarification from you on what, according to 
EPA’s interpretation of the law, statutoril y prevents states from forgiving the principal on loans 
made under the SDWSRF. 

Due to critical nature of the water quality in Flint and the impact that loan forgiveness could 
have on improving the quality of the water, I ask for your prompt attention to this matter.

Subject: Flint water 


As you know there have been problems with the Flint water quality since they left the DWSD system, which was a 
decision by the emergency manager there. Specifically, there has been a boil water order due to bacterial contamination. 
What is not yet broadly known is that attempts to fix that have led to some levels of chlorine-related chemicals that can 
cause long-term damage if not remedied (though we believe they will remedy them before any damage would occur in 
the population). Now apparently the reduced quality is causing GM to leave due to rusted parts. 

I am fairly sure that GM's departure now means the economic rationale for Flint leaving DWSD in the interim while the 
new intake is constructed has just been eliminated. Moreover, our DEQ has been working with Flint's team to try to 
address the technical problem, but doing a blend of DWSD water and Flint water, or going back altogether for a year or 
two while the new lake intake is constructed, have not really been solutions on the table. 

Now we are getting comments about being lab rats in the media, which are going to be exacerbated when it comes out 
that after the boil water order, there were chemicals in the water that exceeded health-based water quality standards. I 
think we should ask the EM to consider coming back to the Detroit system in full or in part as an interim solution to both 
the quality, and now the financial, problems that the current solution is causing. That additional revenue would also help 
DWSD, obviously, and the infrastructure is already in place, so this could be implemented quickly. I am not sure who is 
the best person to initiate that conversation with the EM, but I see this as an urgent matter to fix. 

--Valerie 

P.S. Note:I have not copied DEQ on this message for FOIA reasons. I have sent them the below message from the 
Senator's office and had conversations with them re making sure to brief the EM directly on the water quality issues.

RE: Flint water 


Good gravy. First, just to clarify, when Valerie says 6M is leaving, she means leaving the Flint water system, not 
abandoning the City altogether. 

Second, to anyone 'who grew up in Flint as i did, the notion that I would be getting my drinking water from the Flint River 
is downright scary. Too bad the EM didn't ask me what i thought, though i'rn sure he heard it from plenty of others. My 
Morn is a City resident Nice to know she's drinking water with elevated chlorine levels and fecal eoliform. 


I agree with Valerie. They should try to get back on the Detroit system as a stopgap ASAP before this thing gets too far 
out of control.

MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Sheldon A* Neeley 

STATE REPRESENTATIVE 


January 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 


Dear Gov. Snyder, 

With the dawn of a new beginning in our state, the city of Flint stands on the precipice of civil 
unrest. This letter comes as an appeal to your office concerning this proud Michigan community 
and recent discussions pertaining to Flint’s water distribution and management strategies for both 
present and future operations. Flint has had a long history concerning the implementation of 
water practices and financial management of its water assets. Our present journey has caused us 
to take a closer look at our 80-year-old infrastructure and examine a difficult position where we 
must correct some past and even present challenges, one of which is affecting the people of my 
community to the point of a fervor over something as simple as drinking clean water. 

As we engage these challenges, Flint must revisit the present water revolving loan plans to 
determine how these current funding obligations will affect water delivery and asset 
development for the future. It is clear that no significant improvements can be obtained without 
some supportive concessions. Therefore, I am requesting on behalf of the 34th District, which 
contains a portion of the city of Flint, for you to consider an executive decision to forgive (in- 
total or part) Flint’s water fund loan balances of $20,770,336 so that we may effectively apply 
those funds to rebuilding the city’s infrastructure, to competitively obtain highly qualified 
personnel and provide a more cost effective water delivery system. I understand there has been 
many requests made of your office to resolve this very serious issue, but this approach will best 
safeguard the health and welfare of the residents of Flint as well as minimize the potential for 
litigation against the city of Flint and/or the state of Michigan. 

With a cost-effective water delivery system, we will be able to improve our system in the 
following ways: upgrade wastewater treatment processes, improve safe drinking water upgrades, 
and maintain and sustain a water system that provides a better quality of water product to the 
citizens of Flint.

It is imperative that this issue be addressed in some way on the state level. Residents of Flint are 
already finding themselves forced to take drastic measures simply to have clean drinking water. 

Community health could be on the decline as citizens become afraid to even shower or bathe in 
their homes. The people of Flint bring bottles of brown water full of sediment and other foreign 
substances to community meetings, asking only to be treated as human beings. That is all I am 
asking of you - to see the suffering and anger from the people in one of Michigan’s 
municipalities and understand that there is a need to react and respond to this crisis. 

With the beginning of a new year to work toward a better Michigan, my office is ready to have 
discussions on this request and other planning that works to improve OUR Michigan. I sincerely 
thank you in advance for your consideration on this matter. 

For the Love of the Community, 




Sheldon A. Neeley, State Representative

Subject: Water Quality Update 

Water Advisory Committee, 


Several months have passed since our last meeting and I am writing to update everyone on the most recent 
events surrounding water and our future plans. 


The highly recommended Granulated Activated Carbon installation has started this week and is expected to be 
in use very soon. This fdter change has been recognized by a range of experts as having a significant impact on 
water quality and should ensure good test results in our August testing cycle subsequently removing the City 
from Violation status. 


In addition to the filter change, many of our other initiatives are either completed or are in motion. 

1 . We now have an easy to locate webpage dedicated to water that provides recent and past information to the 
public and helps to maintain transparency. This can be found at the City of Flint website under the heading 
RESIDENTS and then WATER. 

2. We increased our normal valve testing fivefold and have now identified where the majority of inoperable 
valves are located throughout the City. 

3. A system wide leak detection process has been approved and is scheduled to start in August and is expected to 
take 10-14 weeks to complete. 

4. The contract has been signed to replace residential water meters citywide and this process will begin in early 
August. 


l 


5. Chemical dosing and jar testing has continued which has allowed us to monitor and respond to changing 
conditions with increased accuracy. 

6. Our hydraulic model continues to be populated with data and will be a useful tool in helping to pinpoint 
irregularities within the system. 

7. We have maintained a close relationship with the schools and hospitals in order to support all residential 
questions and concerns. 

8. We continue to offer free water tests to anyone requesting this service - please contact us via email at or 
phone 810-787-6537. 


These initiatives are a portion of the increased efforts to provide quality water and to enhance our transparency 
and customer service. 


Please let us know if you are interested in meeting or participating in small groups of six to eight people to visit 
the Treatment Plant with the opportunity to ask any questions of our staff. If you are interested in being a part of 
a scheduled visit please respond to me via email and we will work to make the arrangements. 


Please visit the City website frequently for updated information and we look forward to our next 
correspondence with everyone.

Dear Citizen Advisory Committee, 


It has been some time since our last citizen advisory team meeting and we wanted to reach out at 
this time to those of you who were part of this committee and provide you direct information. 


It was encouraging for us to successfully install the recommended Granulated Activated Carbon 
which led to the City being compliant with the Safe Drinking Water Act but we are now facing 
questions surrounding the amount of lead that is leaching into drinking water through plumbing and 
service lines in certain homes. A significant aspect of lead in drinking water is the public education 
that gives everyone a clear and proper understanding of how this occurs and what are the avenues to 
reduce the risk.

As we consider when it may be beneficial to reconvene another community meeting, we want to

For Immediate Release 



City of Flint Issues Lead Advisory 

Flint, Michigan - September 25, 2015 - The City of Flint is issuing a Lead Advisory for 
residents to be aware of lead levels in drinking water after hearing concerns from the 
medical community. While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to 
ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe. 

The Genesee County Flealth Department has issued a fact sheet regarding lead 
precautions for residents. The fact sheet can be found on their website at www.achd.us . 
Flere are a few of the suggestions the Health Department recommends: 

■ Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes 

■ Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. 

■ Install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. 

Lead contamination can leach into water from a home’s lead water service lines, lead 
solder, and leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. Older 
service lines with pipes and fixtures installed before 1986 can sometimes be more 
susceptible to lead issues due to materials used in the home such as lead based paint 
and lead pipes. 

This message is meant as a precaution to residents and does not mean that all homes in 
th e City will experience the same issue. Residents with concerns about lead service lin es

and lead in home plumbing fixtures are encouraged to contact the City’s Utilities Division 
to schedule a free water testing by calling the Water Treatment Plant at 810-787-6537 
and pressing #1 after prompted or by emailing flintwater@cityofflint.com . 

The City of Flint is working proactively along with the County Health Department, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to improve the water system throughout the City. An accelerated plan to add a 
corrosion control agent to our water within 30 to 60 days with expedited approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is already underway. This will reduce 
corrosion which can cause lead in old pipes to leach into the water. 

This plan is in addition to Mayor Walling’s letter requesting $30 Million in water 
infrastructure assistance funding from the State of Michigan. $10 Million of that request 
would be for the replacement of lead service lines in households to ensure that lead no 
longer presents a danger to the drinking water of our residents. As the letter states, “It is 
the City’s position that the abatement of lead through the removal of lead containing pipes 
and fixtures in homes is the best long term solution to keeping our residents’ water safe.” 

Mayor Walling further stated: "I am extremely concerned about the risks around lead with 
Flint's children and I will be working tirelessly to ensure the water is safe and all of our 
families have the information they need. I also will continue to pursue funding for 
infrastructure improvements and a comprehensive healthy homes initiative that 
addresses lead in paint and pipes. We have to get the lead out of our community to 
eliminate the threat of childhood lead poisoning." 

The City of Flint continues working proactively with the County Health Department, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to improve the water system throughout the City. The City remains committed to 
working with all of our partners in the Water Technical Advisory Committee to address all

issues of public health and quality concerns that face the community. Updates on 
progress made in addressing this issue will be made during regular public meetings 
including City Council and other scheduled meetings. Information on this and all related 
matters will continue to be posted on the City of Flint’s website, cityofflint.com.

Under typical circumstances, lead will dissolve into the water. The concentration of lead in drinking water 


can vary greatly, depending on the corrosiveness of the water, the type and age of the plumbing materials 


and the length of time that the water stands in the pipes. The highest levels of lead occur when very 
corrosive water stands motionless in lead or lead soldered pipe for long periods of time. 


How do I know jf my tap water fg contaminated with lead? 


The only way to know whether your tap water contains lead is to have it tested. You cannot see, taste, or 
smell lead in drinking water. There are different sampling methods for sampling lead in drinking water. 
To determine your household risk, it is recommended to take a first draw sample. 


Lead can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children 
and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal mental and physical 
development of growing bodies. Lead in water can he a special problem for infants, whose diets may be 
mostly liquids, such as baby formulas or concentrated juices mixed with, water. Smaller bodies can absorb 
lead more rapidly than bigger ones. A child's mental and physical growth can be permanently harmed by 
too much lead. Risk will vary , depending on the individual, the circumstances, and the amount of water 
consumed., 


What can. I do to reduce or eliminate lead in mv tap water? 

Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes. The longer the water has 
been sitting in the pipes, the more lead it may contain. You can fill containers for later use, after the 
flushing process. Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels because it dissolves more lead. 

You may choose to install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. If a water filter is installed, 
replace filters at least as often as recommended by the manufacturer. 

Buy a lead-free faucet. The legal definition of "lead-free" still allows brass faucets to contain up to 8 
percent lead. However, faucets marked with "NSF 61/9" and/or "California Proposition 65" meet stricter 
limits. Regularly clean particles from faucet aerators. 







Yes. Bathing and showering should be. safe for you and your children, even if the water contains lead over 
EPA’s action level. Human skin does no! absorb lead in water. This information applies to most situations 
and to a large majority of the population, but individual circumstances may vary. Some situations, such as 
eases involving highly corrosive water, may require additional recommendations or more stringent 


actions. 


Who do I contact for more information? 


The local water authority is always your first, source for testing and identifying lead contamination in vour 


tap water. You can visit foe City of Flint Website at www.tityofflint.com or contact the Flint Water 


Department at 810-787-6537.

Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State of 
Michigan, City of Flint 

State, city failed to release documents sought in FOIA request 

LANSING — State Representative Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) announced earlier today that 
he is filing suit against the state of Michigan and the city of Flint to force them to release 
public documents he requested last month under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

"It's an absolute shame that I have to file suit to force our government to comply with 
the law," Phelps said. "I was shocked at their response, because prior to receiving the denials, 
officials from both the city and state had told me that not only did documents exist, but they 
would be happy to share them with me." 

On Sept. 4 of this year, Phelps requested that the city and state turn over all documents 
and emails regarding the permit and application process that Flint's emergency manager was 
required to complete before the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality gave the go 
ahead to the city to start using the Flint River as its source of drinking water. Late last month, 
the state and the city both denied Phelps' request, saying that no such documents exist.

In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also quoted in 
several articles on Mlive.com, making comments about the permit application process for Flint 
to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit's system to the Flint River. 

"I want to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality of the river water 
before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent actions, it almost seems 
they knew a lot more than they are letting on to," Phelps said. "Flint residents deserve better 
than this, they deserve to know the truth about the decisions that were made, and if I have to 
fight this in court to get the truth, so be it."

It has been some time since our last citizen advisory team meeting and we wanted to reach out at 
this time to those of you who were part of this committee and provide you direct information. 


It was encouraging for us to successfully install the recommended Granulated Activated Carbon 
which led to the City being compliant with the Safe Drinking Water Act but we are now facing 
questions surrounding the amount of lead that is leaching into drinking water through plumbing and 
service lines in certain homes. A significant aspect of lead in drinking water is the public education 
that gives everyone a clear and proper understanding of how this occurs and what are the avenues 
to reduce the risk. 


As we consider when it may be beneficial to reconvene another community meeting, we want to

For Immediate Release 



City of Flint Issues Lead Advisory 

Flint, Michigan - September 25, 2015 - The City of Flint is issuing a Lead Advisory for 
residents to be aware of lead levels in drinking water after hearing concerns from the 
medical community. While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to 
ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe. 

The Genesee County Flealth Department has issued a fact sheet regarding lead 
precautions for residents. The fact sheet can be found on their website at www.achd.us . 
Flere are a few of the suggestions the Health Department recommends: 

■ Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes 

■ Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. 

■ Install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. 

Lead contamination can leach into water from a home’s lead water service lines, lead 
solder, and leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. Older 
service lines with pipes and fixtures installed before 1986 can sometimes be more 
susceptible to lead issues due to materials used in the home such as lead based paint 
and lead pipes. 

This message is meant as a precaution to residents and does not mean that all homes in 
th e City will experience the same issue. Residents with concerns about lead service lin es

and lead in home plumbing fixtures are encouraged to contact the City’s Utilities Division 
to schedule a free water testing by calling the Water Treatment Plant at 810-787-6537 
and pressing #1 after prompted or by emailing flintwater@cityofflint.com . 

The City of Flint is working proactively along with the County Health Department, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to improve the water system throughout the City. An accelerated plan to add a 
corrosion control agent to our water within 30 to 60 days with expedited approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is already underway. This will reduce 
corrosion which can cause lead in old pipes to leach into the water. 

This plan is in addition to Mayor Walling’s letter requesting $30 Million in water 
infrastructure assistance funding from the State of Michigan. $10 Million of that request 
would be for the replacement of lead service lines in households to ensure that lead no 
longer presents a danger to the drinking water of our residents. As the letter states, “It is 
the City’s position that the abatement of lead through the removal of lead containing pipes 
and fixtures in homes is the best long term solution to keeping our residents’ water safe.” 

Mayor Walling further stated: "I am extremely concerned about the risks around lead with 
Flint's children and I will be working tirelessly to ensure the water is safe and all of our 
families have the information they need. I also will continue to pursue funding for 
infrastructure improvements and a comprehensive healthy homes initiative that 
addresses lead in paint and pipes. We have to get the lead out of our community to 
eliminate the threat of childhood lead poisoning." 

The City of Flint continues working proactively with the County Health Department, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to improve the water system throughout the City. The City remains committed to 
working with all of our partners in the Water Technical Advisory Committee to address all

issues of public health and quality concerns that face the community. Updates on 
progress made in addressing this issue will be made during regular public meetings 
including City Council and other scheduled meetings. Information on this and all related 
matters will continue to be posted on the City of Flint’s website, cityofflint.com.

Under typical circumstances, lead will dissolve into the water. The concentration of lead in drinking water 


can vary greatly, depending on the corrosiveness of the water, the type and age of the plumbing materials 


and the length of time that the water stands in the pipes. The highest levels of lead occur when very 
corrosive water stands motionless in lead or lead soldered pipe for long periods of time. 


How do I know if my tap water is contaminated with lead? 


The only way to know whether your tap water contains lead is to have it tested. You cannot see, taste, or 
smell lead in drinking water. There are different sampling methods for sampling lead in drinking water. 
To determine your household risk, it is recommended to take a first draw sample. 


Lead can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children 
and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal mental and physical 
development of growing bodies. Lead in water can he a special problem for infants, whose diets may be 
mostly liquids, such as baby formulas or concentrated juices mixed with water. Smaller bodies can absorb 
lead more rapidly than bigger ones. A child's mental and physical growth can be permanently harmed by 
too much lead. Risk will vary, depending on the individual, the circumstances, and the amount of water 
consumed.. 


What can I do to reduce or eliminate lead in mv tap water? 

Flush your cold-water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes. The longer the water has 
been sitting in the pipes, the more lead it may contain. You can fill containers for later use, after the 
flushing process. Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for 
making baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels because it dissolves more lead. 

You may choose to install a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal. If a water filter is installed, 
replace filters at least as often as recommended by the manufacturer. 

Buy a lead-free faucet. The legal definition of "lead-free" still allows brass faucets to contain up to 8 
percent lead. However, faucets marked with "NSF 61/9" and/or "California Proposition 65" meet stricter 
limits. Regularly clean particles from faucet aerators. 








Yes. Bathing and showering should be. safe for you and your children, even if the water contains lead over 
EPA’s action level. Human skin does no! absorb lead in water. This information applies to most situations 
and to a large majority of the population, but individual circumstances may vary. Some situations, such as 
cases involving highly corrosive water, may require additional recommendations or more stringent 


actions. 


Whit do I contact for more information? 


The local water authority is always your first source for testing and identifying lead contamination in your 


tap water. You can visit foe City of Flint Website at www.cityofflint.com or contact the Flint Water 


Department at 810-787-6537.

particular fiscal year's capitalization grant, it cannot reserve the authority to take the 
remaining balance of the allowance from future capitalization grants. 

The outstanding Flint loans that are the subject of your inquiry were made in 1999, 2000, 2001 
and 2003. In these years, the State had the option of providing additional subsidy when making 
these initial loans. To exercise this option the State would have been required to issue an 
intended use plan identifying the new, initial financing and to determine Flint’s eligibility to 
receive principal forgiveness. Pursuant to 40 CFR 35.3525 (b)(2), a State may not reserve the 
authority to provide loan subsidies; this means a state cannot allocate any previously unallocated 
loan subsidy using current funds. 

Since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Congressional appropriations have 
provided additional language to further clarify the timing and use of additional subsidy - 
language which you reference in your letter: 

Provided further, that not less than 20 percent but not more that 30 percent of the funds 
made available under this title to each State for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund 
capitalization grants shall be used by the State to provide additional subsidy to eligible 
recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or any 
combination of these), and shall be used by the State only where such funds are provided 
as initial financing for an eligible recipient or to buy, refinance, or restructure the debt 
obligations of eligible recipients only where such debt was incurred on or after the date 
of enactment of this Act:... ” (emphasis added). 

Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. Law 1 1 3-235 

This language provides for additional subsidy (including principal forgiveness) only for debt 
“incurred on or after the date of enactment of this Act.” As the DWSRF loans were provided to 
Flint prior to the date that this language first appeared in the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act and in subsequent Appropriations Acts, the State does not have authority to 
provide additional subsidy for those loans. 



Although the loans that arc the subjeelof your inquiry are noteligifele lor loan forgiveness. the 
■City of.Flitit- £0tSy - principal forgiveness in connection with new 
applications for State SRF funding.. HP A is aVnittAieC) provide assistance with that process if

Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State of 
Michigan, City of Flint 

State, city failed to release documents sought in FOIA request 

LANSING — State Representative Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) announced earlier today that 
he is filing suit against the state of Michigan and the city of Flint to force them to release 
public documents he requested last month under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 


i 



"It's an absolute shame that I have to file suit to force our government to comply with 
the law/' Phelps said. "I was shocked at their response, because prior to receiving the denials, 
officials from both the city and state had told me that not only did documents exist, but they 
would be happy to share them with me." 

On Sept. 4 of this year, Phelps requested that the city and state turn over all documents 
and emails regarding the permit and application process that Flint's emergency manager was 
required to complete before the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality gave the go 
ahead to the city to start using the Flint River as its source of drinking water. Late last month, 
the state and the city both denied Phelps' request, saying that no such documents exist. 

In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also quoted in 
several articles on Mlive.com, making comments about the permit application process for Flint 
to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit's system to the Flint River. 

"I want to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality of the river water 
before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent actions, it almost seems 
they knew a lot more than they are letting on to," Phelps said. "Flint residents deserve better 
than this, they deserve to know the truth about the decisions that were made, and if I have to 
fight this in court to get the truth, so be it."

VERIFIED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT COMPLAINT 

There is no other pending or resolved civil 
action arising out of the transaction or 
occurrence alleged in the Complaint against 
Defendant. 


Keith D. Flynn 

Plaintiff Phil Phelps, (“Plaintiff”), by and through his attorneys, Miller Cohen, 


P.L.C., for his Freedom of Information Act Complaint, states as follows: 

Since Spring 2014, families in the City of Flint have been exposed to a significant threat to 
their health and well-being caused by the decision to switch the City’s water supply from Lake 
Huron water to Flint River water. This decision was made by the State’s appointed Emergency 
Manager in the name of saving money. In the process, the health and welfare of Flint residents has 
been carelessly jeopardized with thousands of residents being exposed to contaminants, including 
E.coli, disinfectant byproduct, and, most recently, lead.

This threat is the very reason why the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(DEQ) exists — to protect the public by insisting upon compliance with federal and state 
environmental regulations. The DEQ is supposed to work with suppliers of water, such as the City 
of Flint, and approve or reject applications for permits to alter existing water systems, including 
changes that are made to the source of water. MCL § 325. 1004(6). Part of this process requires 
localities to provide the DEQ with detailed technical information evaluating any impact that 
proposed alterations might have on the quality of water provided to the public. Id. 

State Representative Phil Phelps issued information requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the Michigan 
Department of Treasury, and the City of Flint. Representative Phelps wants to see if the State and 
City knew in advance about the potential hazards now faced by Flint residents. He wants to see 
what had been done to avoid this disaster. He requests documents concerning evaluations of the 
quality of water in the Flint River, documents specifically pertaining to the application and permit 
process, and other documents relating to the change in the City’s water source. 

In public statements, State and City officials have discussed documents addressing the 
change from Detroit to Flint River water as Flint’s primary source of water. However, in response 
to Representative Phelps’ FOIA requests, they now deny that such documents exist. The 
cleanliness of the water is a critical health and safety issue, which must be revealed to the public. 

I The Defendants cannot make public assurances of the existence of documents, only to refuse to 
turn those documents over. 

As a result, Representative Phelps is now forced to file this action, along with another action 
in the Michigan Court of Claims, seeking to disclose information that the public has the right to 
know. For those reasons, Plaintiff Phelps seeks an Order from this Court requiring the City to 
respond to Plaintiffs FOIA requests and seeking costs and attorney fees for having to file this action.

THE DECISION TO SWITCH FROM DWSD WATER TO FLINT RIVER WATER 

1 2 . Prior to switching from DW SD to Flint River water, the City of Flint, in conjunction 
with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of 
Treasury engaged in a process to evaluate the potential of using the Flint River as Flint’s primary 
source of water. {Exhibit A, 91-95) 

13. Gerald Ambrose, the financial advisor to the emergency manager for the City of 
Flint at the time, testified that: “There was brief evaluation of whether the City would be better off 
to simply use the Flint River as its primary source of water over the long term. That was 
determined not to be feasible.” (Id. at 91) 

14. Mr. Ambrose went on to testify that the determination that it was not feasible was 
made by “the emergency management team based on conversations with the MDEQ that indicated 
they would not be supportive of the use of the Flint River on a long-term basis as a primary source 
of water.” (Id.) 

15. Mr. Ambrose also testified in regards to an independent study that was conducted 
by the State Department of Treasury as to the feasibility of changing the source of water to the 

I 

| Flint River. (Id. at 93-94) 

16. Notwithstanding this evaluation, the City of Flint decided to move forward with 
changing the source of its drinking water to the Flint River until the KWA pipeline was finished. 

17. In order to do so, however, the City of Flint was required by the Safe Drinking 
Water Act to apply for a permit to change the source of water:

(6) Before commencing the construction of a waterworks system or an alteration, 
addition, or improvement to a system, a supplier of water shall submit the plans and 
specifications for the improvements to the department and secure from the department 
a permit for construction as provided by rule. Plans and specifications submitted to the 
department shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed under article 20 of the 
occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.2001 to 339.2014. A contractor, builder, 
or supplier of water shall not engage in or begin the construction of a waterworks 
system or an alteration, addition, or improvement to a waterworks system until a valid 
permit for the construction has been secured from the department. A contractor, builder, 
or supplier of water who permits or allows construction to proceed without a valid 
permit, or in a manner not in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by 
the department, violates this act. A supplier of water shall not issue a voucher or check 
or in any other way expend money or provide consideration for construction of a 
waterworks system unless a valid permit issued by the department is in effect. The 
department may issue a permit with conditions to correct minor design deficiencies. If 
eligible, a supplier may request an expedited review of an application for a permit under 
section 4a. 

MCL § 325.1004(6). 

18. The Safe Drinking Water Act provides that the DEQ administers the Act and 
promulgates administrative rules to enforce its requirements. One of those administrative rules 
defines “alteration” to include “modification of, or addition to, an existing waterworks system, or 
portion of the system, that affects ... the source . . . .” Admin. Rule 325.10102. 

19. On the DEQ’s website, the DEQ provides the application discussed above. 
{Exhibit B ) 

20. The application requires the submission of highly technical plans and analysis for 


the alteration of the Water System. (Id.) 


21. Failure of a “supplier of water” — which include municipalities — to apply and 
receive a permit prior to alteration of a Water System violates the Act punishable by a fine of not 
more than $5,000.00 for each day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or 
both. MCL § 325.1021. 

22. Prior to switching to the Flint River, it was reported that the City was in the process 
of applying for such a permit. {Exhibit C)

23. On March 28, 2014, it was reported that the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality halted the City’s attempt to move forward with the switch in water source 
without receiving the permit. (Id.) Steve Busch, the Lansing and Jackson district supervisor for 
the DEQ, noted that the DEQ had only received “preliminary design plans and preliminary 
specifications” that the agency had commented on. (Id.) 

24. Howard Croft, Flint’s Director of Public Works, denied the inadequacy of the plans 
provided noting that the City had provided “A fully engineered construction package, including 
all the work to be performed.” (Id.) He went on to note that, “The submittal package has been 
under review for more than 30 days. The city has had ongoing discussions with the DEQ regarding 
the process and we anticipate a favorable response soon.” (Id.) 

25. On April 5, 2014, Emergency Manager Earley stated that the final application for 
the permit was filed with the DEQ noting that “We expect to have the permit early next week.” 
{Exhibit D ) 

26. Sure enough, the very next week, the spokesman for the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ), Brad Wurfel, was reported on April 10, 2014 as saying that the 
DEQ issued “a series of construction permits” noting that “They are racing to get all this work 
done.” {Exhibit E) 

27. The switch to Flint River water took place on April 25, 2014. {Exhibit F)

28. Since switching to Flint River water, Flint residents have been placed in jeopardy 
being exposed to substantial threats to their health and safety due to contaminants found in their 
drinking water. 

29. On August 14, 2014, the water tested positive for fecal coliform bacteria, E.coli, 
leading the City to issue a boil water advisory. {Exhibit G ) 

30. The water once again tested positive on August 1 9, 201 4 with boil water advisories 
extending into late September 2014. {Exhibit H) 

31. On January 2, 2015, a new threat to public health and safety was identified. In an 
effort to eliminate the bacteria, the City increased the chlorine used in the System. Residents began 
complaining that the water was causing skin rashes and their hair falling out. {Exhibit I) 

32. Then, on January 2, 2015, the City of Flint officially announced that the level of 
trihalomethanes (TTHMs) — a byproduct of disinfectant — was higher than the allowable amount 
provided for in federal law forcing the City to provide notice to residents. {Exhibit J) 

33. Long term exposure to TTHMs can create liver, kidney, or central nervous system 
problems, and may increase the risk of cancer, especially amongst those who have severely 

compromised immune systems such as infants or the elderly. (Id.) 

I 

34. Over nine months later, the City was finally able to reduce TTHM levels to the 
federal limit. {Exhibit K) 

35. Most recently, in July 2015, Virginia Tech University researchers released the 
results of their own independent study of Flint’s water supply revealing incredibly high amounts 
of lead far exceeding the allowable limitations of lead content under federal law. {Exhibit L)

36. On September 2, 2015, the researchers at Virginia Tech released another study that 
compared the DWSD water to the Flint River water (. Exhibit L) That study concluded that the 
natural corrosive properties of Flint River water is leaching lead from the City’s aging 
infrastructure. {Exhibit L ) 

37. On September 24, 2015, the results of a subsequent study by Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha, program director for the pediatric residency at the Hurley Children’s Hospital at Hurley 
Medical Center in Flint were released finding an elevated level of lead in the blood samples of 
Flint children. {Exhibit M) Specifically, the study showed that the number of children in the City 
with elevated blood levels nearly doubled after the city started using the river. (Id.) 

38. According to Dr. Hanna- Attisha: “What we found in our data is concerning.” (Id.) 
Dr. Hanna- Attisha noted that “This is not something you mess around with.” (Id.) 

REPRESENTATIVE PHELPS SEEKS DOCUMENTS RELATING TO 
CHANGING THE CITY’S SOURCE OF WATER TO 

THE FLINT RIVER AND THE CITY AND STATE FAILED TO COMPLY 

39. In response to this health crisis, Representative Phelps requested the following 
records from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of 
Treasury, and the City of Flint pursuant to FOIA on September 4, 2015: 


1. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality], or its agents, has in its possession, 
including correspondence, related to any waivers, permits or applications to use the 
Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the City of Flint or any 
other municipality or municipal entity. 

2. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality], or its agents, has in its possession, 
including correspondence, related to any communications between the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality, or its agents, and/or the Michigan 
Department of Treasury, or its agents, regarding any waivers, permits or 
applications to use the Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for 
the City of Flint or any other municipality or municipal entity.

Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the City of Flint or any 
other municipality or municipal entity. 

{Exhibit N)

3:00pm and ending around 4:20pm. Representative Sheldon Neeley was also present during the 
meeting. 

41. Both Representative Phelps and Neeley asked several questions regarding the 
switch to Flint River water, the permits and applications surrounding the switch, potential hold 
ups/delays in the switch due to DEQ’s approval process, and correspondence between the City of 
Flint and the DEQ regarding all of the previous items. 

42. Howard Croft said that they did in fact have documents related to those topics and 
stated that it would be no problem to share them with both Representatives. 

43. On September 14, 2015, the City of Flint changed its story. In the City of Flint’s 
formal response to Representative Phelps’ FOIA requests dated September 14, 2015, the City has 
refused to provide those documents. {Exhibit O) 

44. Contradicting Mr, Croft’s earlier assertions as well as statements made to the press 

in 2014, the City of Flint asserted that no such documents exist: 

The records which you have requested do not exist under the name given by the 
requester or by another name reasonably known to this public body or are not retained 
by this public body in the performance of an official functions. This is a certification 
of their non-existence. No Records — -Requested documents do not exist. 



45. The DEQ responded on or about September 1 6 th by telephone indicating that it was 
DEQ policy to provide copies of documents to members of the State Legislature free of charge 
and noting that there were several documents that would be sent over to Representative Phelps’ 

| office via email, but only if he withdrew his FOIA request. 

46. Representative Phelps indicated that he had to contact his attorney to discuss 
whether he should withdraw the FOIA requests. Since that day, Representative has not received 
any verbal communication with the DEQ. 

47. On September 28, 2015, after Representative Phelps refused to withdraw his FOIA 
request, the DEQ changed its tone like the City of Flint. {Exhibit P) 

48. Brad Wurfel, the spokesman for the DEQ stated in an interview with Gongwer that 
“Flint did not have to file an application because the City has always listed the Flint River as its 
back-up should it need it for a water supply.” {Exhibit Q) 

49. Obviously, Mr. Wurfel’s most recent statement ignores the statements that he, and 
others, made to the media prior to the switch. They all maintained that Flint was required to file 
an application for a permit with the DEQ and did in fact file an application that was ultimately 
approved by the DEQ on or about April 10, 2014, 

50. Nonetheless, Mr. Wurfel indicated during that interview that “other documents . . . 
are available — to Mr. Phelps or anyone — dealing with the process the city and state took preparing 
for the switch.” (Id.) To date, Representative Phelps has not received these other documents. 

51. Similarly, the Michigan Department of Treasury denied Representative Phelps’

53. The public has a right to know the degree to which the State knew about or took 
any action to determine the potential hazards of making this switch, prior to the decision being 
implemented by the State-appointed Emergency Manager. It is for that reason that Representative 
Phil Phelps brings this suit to compel the City of Flint to provide the documents requested pursuant 
to FOIA. 

COUNT I 

VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 

54. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference each of the preceding paragraphs. 

55. Documents, such as correspondence and communications, relating to any waivers, 
pennits or applications to use the Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the 
City of Flint or any other municipality or municipal entity constitute public records subject to 
FOIA. 

56. Plaintiff reasonably described the documents that he was seeking. 

57. No exemption recognized under FOIA applies to Representative Phelps’ requests. 

58. The Defendant’s denial is wholly without merit as acknowledged by the 
Defendant’s own agents in the past. Defendant failed to perform a good faith effort to conduct a 
search for the requested records using methods reasonably expected to produce the requested 
information. 

59. Hence, Defendant violated the FOIA, and for the violation, the Defendant should 
face all fines, costs and fees as pursuant to the FOIA statute, as well as be ordered to immediately 
tender the information. 

60. Due to the Defendant’s refusal to respond to the FOIA requests, the Defendant now 
bears the burden to sustain the reason for its denial. MCL §15.240(4).

61. MCL § 15.240(5) provides that actions commenced pursuant to FOIA “shall be 
assigned for hearing and trial and for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in 


every way. 


WHEREFORE, and for the above-stated reasons, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable 
Court grant the following relief: 


a. Order an expedited hearing as required by MCL § 1 5.240(5); 


b. Order that the Defendant to immediately respond to the FOIA requests of 
Plaintiff as found in the Exhibit N letters;

c. Find that the Defendant made a final determination to deny the FOIA requests, 
and such determination was in violation of the FOIA and arbitrary and 
capricious. Thus, Order that the Defendant pay to Plaintiff reasonable

talking about, are you referring to the cost of the 
City's participation in the pipeline? 

Q Both . 

A I had no direct involvement in any discussions relating 
to the actual cost estimates for the construction of the 
pipeline. I was, however, involved in doing the analysis 
of the cost benefit to the City of participating in the 
Karegnondi Water Authority as compared to continuing to 
receive, to purchase water from the Detroit Water and 
Sevier System. 

Q Were any other options — did you look at any other 

options apart from those two or variations of those two? 

A There was brief evaluation of whether the City would be 
better off to simply use the Flint River as its primary 
source of water over the long term. That was determined 
not to be feasible. 

Q Who determined that it wasn't feasible? 

A It was a collective decision of the emergency management 
team based on conversations with the MDEQ that indicated 
they would not be supportive of the use of the Flint 
River on a long-term basis as a primary source of water. 

Q What was the reason that they gave? 

A You'll have to ask them. 

Q Okay. You don't recall? 

A I do not recall.

Q Now, am I correct in that is actually what is happening ; 

f 

now, for at least a short-term — j 

i 

A That's correct. . 

Q — the City of Flint is using its own facilities and 
supplying its own water through the Flint River? 

A That is correct. . 

Q When was the possibility of using that as a long-term 
solution abandoned? 

MR. WARREN: Do you mean the Flint River? 

MR. ALEC GIBBS: Yes. ■ 

THE WITNESS: Probably sometime in FY13. I j 

don't recall specifically. | 

MR. BADE: I'm just going to object to the form ■ 

of the question. Abandoned by whom? ' 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) By the collective body that was 

responsible for making the ultimate decision by the City : 

i 

of Flint, I assume. Sometime in fiscal year 2013? 

A Sometime between — I guess sometime probably during '13, 

I believe, or perhaps even midway through '12. 

Q Okay. ' 

A I don't recall the specific dates. 

Q But it was based on communications from the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality. 

MR. WARREN: Objection; asked and answered. 

You can answer.

communicated the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality’s position? 

MR. WARREN: Object to lack of foundation. You 

can answer. 

THE WITNESS: I believe it was our utilities 

administrator, our public works director.

A Howard Croft, Daugherty Johnson. • 

Q Are you aware of an independent study on the feasibility 
of alternative plans for water supply for the City of 

\ 

Flint that was commissioned by the Department of ; 

Treasury? i 

MR. WARREN: I'm going to object to relevance. 

We're getting really far afield here. I'm not directing 
him not to answer, but hopefully this can be tied up very ; 
quickly and we can all move on. 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) I’m just asking if you're aware of 

the study. j 

A Tell me what the name of the study is. 

Q I have it here. Mark this as Exhibit 5.

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) Do you recognize this study? 

A I do not recall seeing this actual document, but I am 

aware of the study. 

Q Okay. Do you remember when this study was commissioned? 

A I don't know. Apparently it was completed in February of 

2013. 

Q The study makes reference to a number of meetings between 
the City of Flint and the Department of Treasury 
concerning the investigation into water supply options 
for the City of Flint. Did you participate in any of 
those meetings? 

A I did. 

Q What meetings do you recall participating in?

remember when. 

Q Do you remember if one of those meetings took place in 
December of 2012? 

A I do not recall the date. 

Q Do you remember who participated in these meetings? 

A I do not recall. I was in attendance with the emergency 
manager then Michael Brown, as I recall, or Ed Kurtz. I 
honestly do not recall the dates and the timing. 

Q Okay. There is a reference to, if you look to Page 2 of 
the study, it says although it appeared that this was

a — it references an option for the Flint water 
treatment plant to supply the City of Flint without being 
supplied from either DWSD or KWA was initially 
considered. The preliminary investigation evaluated the 1 
cost associated with the required improvements to the 
plant and the Flint River dam system. And that although 
it appeared that this was a viable option, Flint, in a 
meeting on December 20th, 2012 with the treasury, stated 
that the City did not want to pursue that option and it

is no longer being considered.

reached. ;

evaluations of the cost projections at least as it i 

concerned Flint's contribution to the pipeline. j

annual contributions will be over the term of years for 
the loan bond amounts? In other words, what are Flint's i 
debt service payments relative to the pipeline 
construction going to be on an annual basis?

G. Actual flows and pressures of existing system 

at the connection point(s) (2) gpm at psi 

gpm at psi 

gpm at psi 

gpm at psi 

H. Estimated minimum flows and pressures within 

the proposed water main system (3) gpm at psi 


(1) Every water system must decide what levels of fire fighting flows they wish to provide. Fire flow should be appropriate 
for the area (residential, commercial, industrial) being served by the project. Typical fire flow rates can be obtained 
from the water supply, local fire dept., ISO or AWWA. The water system must then be designed to be able to provide 
the required fire flows while maintaining at least 20 psi in all portions of the distribution system. 

(2) Flows and pressures at the connection points must be given to determine if the existing water main(s) are able to 
deliver water to the new service area. These numbers can be obtained from a properly modeled and calibrated 
distribution system hydraulic analysis or hydrant flow tests performed in the field. If more than one connection is 
proposed, list as needed. 

(3) List what the estimated minimum flows can be expected in the proposed water mains based on estimated water 
demands, head losses, elevation changes and other factors that may affect flows, such as dead end mains.

FLINT, MI - Not so fast, state officials are telling Flint administrators charging toward an April 18 date to 
begin using the Flint River for all of the city’s water needs. 

The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality says it hasn't received the proper paperwork from the 
city. When the state does get it, a review of the application for state permission to use the river could take 
30 to 45 days. 

The city is switching over from buying treated water from Detroit to using the Flint River for drinking water 
temporarily. Once the Karegnondi Water Authority completes its pipeline from Lake Huron to Genesee 
County, Flint will switch to the KWA. 

"In regards to the actual application, we haven't received one," said Steve Busch, Lansing and Jackson 
district supervisor in the DEQ's office of drinking water and municipal assistance. "We've received 
preliminary design plans and preliminary specifications and we've commented on those. They may be 
waiting until they have all the comments worked out before they submit the application." 

Flint has bought treated Lake Huron water from Detroit, but that contract was terminated when Flint signed 
on to purchase 18 million gallons of raw water per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. The contract 
termination goes into effect April 17. 

The under-construction pipeline will bring raw Lake Huron water to Flint and Genesee County when it is 
complete by the end of 2016. 

People in the city will drink Flint River water until the pipeline is complete. The Detroit Water and Sewerage

Department said it would stop selling water to Flint and Genesee County on its current contract on April 
17, 2014. Genesee County is negotiating with Detroit for water until the KWA pipeline is flowing. 

Busch said state reviews generally take between 30 and 45 days, but would not comment on if Flint would 
be ready to transition to river water by the time Detroit terminates the contract with the city. 

"A fully engineered construction package, including all the work to be performed, has been submitted to the 
DEQ by the city of Flint in preparation for the transition to use of the Flint River as a temporary primary 
water source," said Howard Croft, Flint's director of public works, in a statement. "The submittal package 
has been under review for more than 30 days. The city has had ongoing discussions with the DEQ regarding 
the process and we anticipate a favorable response soon." 

If the state hasn't approved Flint's use of river water by April 18, Busch said, the city would just continue to 
buy water from Detroit on a non-contract price until Flint has state OK to begin using the river. 

"I don't think there is any scenario that we will just willy-nilly cut off service for Flint," said Bill Johnson, a 
consultant and spokesman for Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. "Negotiations are continuing." 

Croft said the DEQ has been reviewing the request and asking questions throughout, 

"When both sides come to an agreement and all issues have been addressed, then the permit is granted," 
Croft said in the statement. "Flint has been in ongoing communication with Genesee County and the DWSD 
to ensure that there is no interruption of water service to Flint customers. As the Mayor (Dayne Walling) said 
in his State of the City address ’beginning this spring, we will be using treated water from the Flint River as 
our temporary primary water source. 1 We are still on target to meet this goal.” 

Croft said there will be a series of public forums where residents can ask questions about the city's water 
transition, what that will mean for rates and others. He did not have specifics about when and where those 
meetings will take place.

Emergency manager says city could have permit to use Flint River water by next week Page 1 of 2 



Emergency manager says city could have permit to use Flint 
River water by next week

FLINT, MI — The city expects to have a state permit that will allow it to use the Flint River for drinking water 
by next week. 

Emergency manager Darnell Earley said today, April 4, that the final application for the permit has been filed 
with the state Department of Environmental Quality after months of working with the state to ensure smooth 
sailing for the application. 

"We expect to have the permit early next week," said Earley. "We are still on track to operate our treatment 
plant this spring." 

The emergency manager's comments come after a story in MLive-The Flint Journal last week indicated 
the DEQ had not received the proper paperwork from the city for permission to use the river. 

DEQ officials said in the story that the application process could take 30-45 days, but Earley challenged the 
idea that it will take that long and said city and state officials have been working closely in advance of 
submitting the final application. 


The city is attempting to switch from buying treated water from the city of Detroit to using the Flint River for 
drinking water temporarily by mid-April. 

Once the Karegnondi Water Authority completes its pipeline to Lake Huron, the city has committed to 
switching back to using water from Lake Huron and the KWA again 

Earley said he expects to transition from Detroit water to Flint River water by April 17, the date Detroit 
officials have set for terminating the existing arrangement between the two cities. 

"We don't think there will be a lag" between those dates, he said. 

Earley said he has a contingency plan if the switch to the Flint River isn't made by April 17. Detroit Water

Flint gets final permit approvals from state to use Flint River for 
drinking water

FLINT, MI — Bottoms up, Flint. 

The state of Michigan has issued the permits needed for the city to begin using the Flint River for drinking water, a 
major step toward ending water purchases from the city of Detroit as eariy as next week. 

''They've got a series of construction permits" that were issued Wednesday, April 10, said Brad Wurfel, a spokesman 
for the state Department of Environmental Quality. "They areracing to get all this work done." 

The permits have been on Flint's to-do list since the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it was terminating 
its contract to sell water here on April 17. 

That deadline was issued one year ago, and city and state water officials have been working and consulting on 
required upgrades at Flint's water treatment plant since. 

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz said today, April 10,that the city is still targeting April 17 as the day to shut off Lake 
Huron water — treated and pumped here by DWSD -- and to turn on the intakes into the river. 

Because work is still going on inside and outside the city's treatment plant, the exact time and date for the switch 
hasn't been set yet, Lorenz said. 

Earlier this week, Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley called the city's ability to cut out the cost of water 
purchases from Detroit a "monumental change" for the city. 

"The city of Flint will be able to control water costs," Earley said. "I'm kind of glad we're not a part of that discussion 
(about the future of the Detroit water system) anymore." 

A consultant hired by Earley is expected to recommend new water rates during a City Council committee meeting at 
5 p.m. today. The emergency manager has already saidrates will not be reduced because of upgrades that are 
needed in Flint’s water distribution system, 

Flint officials will need that infrastructure upgrade whether they use river or lake water. City officials have signed an 
agreement to use Lake Huron water supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority once the pipeline it is building is 
completed — something that's expected to happen in 2016.

FLINT, MI - Mayor Dayne Walling asked fora countdown from the group of about a dozen people huddled 
inside a small building on Friday, April 25. 

"Three, two, one," they counted, then Wailing pushed a small black button. 

Seconds later, a green light winked out, and that was it. 

Watch the video to see Flint effectively cut its water ties with Detroit when the mayor pushes the button. 

Flint will use the river until the Karegnondi Water Authority builds its pipeline to Genesee County. The $274 
million project is expected to be complete sometime in 2016. 

Friday's event at the Flint water treatment plant also featured Walling and other elected officials 
drinking Flint River water. 

"It tastes like. ..water," said Fourth Ward Councilman Joshua Freeman after drinking a cup. 

It should take about two days for the residual Detroit water to clear the city's water system before all Flint 
customers will be drinking treated river water. 

"Water is an absolute vital service that most everyone takes for granted," Walling said. "It's a historic 
moment for the city of Flint to return to its roots and use our own river as our drinking water supply."

Second positive coliform bacteria test means Flint's west side water boil notice still in effect Page 1 of 3 



Second positive coliform bacteria test means Flint's west side 
water boil notice still in effect

(This story has been updated to correct 
information about water test results in the 
boil water advisory area.) 

FLINT, MI — A second water sample in an 
area where residents have been told to 
boil their drinking water has tested 
positive for total coliform, meaning owners 
of businesses and residents there should 
continue to boil water until further notice - 
- at least until Wednesday, Aug. 19. 

"We don't know yet what caused this. We 
don't have a smoking pistol," said 
Mike Prysby, an engineer with the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. 

Update: Flint officials say 'abnormal' test to blame in E. coli scare 

Flint officials have ramped up testing in the boil-water area, a half-mile square area on the city's west side, 
since a positive test for fecal coliform bacteria on Thursday, Aug. 14. 

Fecal coliform bacteria — also known as E.coli — can make people sick, and are a particular concern for 
those with weakened immune systems. 

Prysby called fecal coliform bacteria in drinking water unusual, something that typically happens fewer than 
a half-dozen times in any given year statewide. Sometimes, doesn't happen anywhere in Michigan over a full 
calendar year, he said. 

The second positive test for total coliform came from samples taken Saturday, Aug. 16, according to Prysby. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says positive total coliform tests suggest there may be a pathway

for pathogens and/or fecal contamination to enter the drinking water distribution system. 

For drinking water, total coliforms are used to determine the adequacy of water treatment and the integrity 
of the distribution system, according to ERA. 


"The absence of total coiiforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecal pathogens are 
present," the agency Web site says. "Thus, total coliforms are used to determine the vulnerability of a 
system to fecal contamination," 


Fecal coliform and E. coli are bacteria that 
indicate water may be contaminated with 
human or animal feces. 


This is the area in which a boil water advisory is in effect on the west 
side of the city of Flint. 


Microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms, and may also 
pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely 
compromised immune systems, according to a news release from the city. 

Flint's boil advisory is in an area bordered by Mann Hall Avenue on the north and east, Whitney Avenue on 
the south, and the city limits on the west. 

The contamination is a concern for Sandi Blackmon, owner of Sandi's Elegant Catering on South Ballenger 
Highway, who said she's scrambling to keep up with her work with a boil advisory in effect. 

Not only does the advisory say water for drinking should be boiled, but also water for washing dishes — even 
brushing teeth. 

"I’m concerned, because I'm a former culinary arts student. I know about what food-born bacteria can do ... 
E.coli can be deadly," Blackmon said. 

Representatives of other restaurants in the busy commercial area of Balleneger and Corunna Road said they 
were boiling water Monday and will be until they receive an all-clear message from City Hail. 

"It's inconvenient but we do it — we do the best we can," said David Todorovsky, an owner of Atlas Coney 
Island. 


Flint Counciiwoman Vicki VanBuren, who represents the area, has another reason for concern about the boil 
water advisory. 

"My mother lives in that area," VanBuren said. "She has a lot of health concerns (so) I took her over some 
bottled water and told her not to use (tap water) to drink or cook with it.

"This would concern me no matter what part of the city it was in," she said. 

Council members could get more information on the water contamination and what may have caused it at 
committee meetings this week. 

In the meantime, Prysby said there are multiple possible explanations for the contamination, including water 
main breaks in the area, chlorine levels that are off-kilter or a poor sample location or collection technique. 

Prysby said water coming out of Flint's water treatment plant continues to meet all drinking water standards, 
meaning the problem is within the water distribution system. 

"We haven't confirmed a reason," he said of the results, "We're still investigating further. In some situations, 
we never find out why." 

The city is warning the people in the localized area to not drink the water without boiling it first for one 
minute, and letting it cool before using. 

Boiled or bottled water should be used for not just drinking, but for making ice, brushing teeth, washing 
dishes and preparing food.

Flint's west side has tested positive again 

for total coliform, and the city's boi! water 

advisory there is continuing until at least Wednesday, Aug. 20.

Mike Prysby, district engineer for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, said water in the half- 
square-mile area tested positive for total coliform on Saturday, Aug. 16, and Sunday, Aug. 17. 

Flint officials have ramped up testing in the boil-water area since a positive test for fecal coliform 
bacteria on Thursday, Aug. 14. 


The boil-water area is Mann Hall Avenue on the north and east, Whitney Avenue on the south, and the city 
limits on the west. 


Fecal coliform bacteria — also known as E.coli -- can make people sick, and are a particular concern for 
those with weakened immune systems.

"The absence of total conforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecal pathogens are 
present," the agency Web site says. "Thus, total conforms are used to determine the vulnerability of a 
system to fecal contamination." 

The city of Flintissued a statement Monday, Aug. 18, saying "testing over the last 48 hours has shown no 
signs of E. coii or fecal coliform bacteria in the water," but makes no mention of the total coliform test 
results. 


The city's statement says a sampling error is believed to be to blame for the initial abnormal test,

Prysby said the back-to-back positive total coliform tests are a "general indicator there could be 
more pathogenic organisms present" in water but is "not a direct indicator." 

"We haven't narrowed it down to any one possibility (but) we don't play Russian roulette with public health," 
Prysby said of the abnormal samples and the need to continue testing. 

Prysby said test results are "moving in the right direction" because there have been no additional discoveries 
of E. coli or fedcal coliform bacteria in water.

FLINT, MI — The city has issued a boil 
advisory for a portion of Flint, saying water 
in the area has tested positive for total 
coliform bacteria. 

The area of the advisory is bordered by 
Dayton Street on the north, DuPont Street 
on the east, the Flint River on the south, 
and by Lavelle Road to the Flint River on 
the west, the city said in a news released 
issued today. Sept. 5. 

The latest advisory marks the second 
time in less than 30 days that residents 
and businesses in a part of the city have 
been told to boii or use bottled water for 
drinking, bathing, making ice, brushing 
teeth, washing dishes, and preparing food. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
says positive total coliform tests suggest 
there may be a pathway for pathogens

system to feca! contamination." 

Boiling water kills bacteria or other harmful organisms, according to the city's advisory. 

"Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Conforms are bacteria which are naturally 
present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially-harmful, bacteria may be 
present," the city's statement says. 

"Usually, coliforms are a sign that there couid be a problem with the treatment or distribution system 
(pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if other bacteria 
of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E. coli, are present. We did not find any of these bacteria in our 
subsequent testing," the statement says. 

The city says it will flush the system in the boil advisory area and increase chlorine added to water. 

All water testing results at the city's Water Treatment Plant have shown Flint's water, which is drawn from 
the Flint River, meets all Safe Water Drinking Standards when it leaves the facility. 

The city says anyone with questions about the advisory or any other water issues should call 810-787-6537.

important Information About Your Drinking Water 

Tests showed coiiform bacteria in the City of Flint water 

Our water system recently violated a drinking water standard. Although this incident was not an 
emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we did to correct the 
situation. 

We routinely monitor for drinking water contaminants. We took 150 samples to test for the presence of 
coiiform bacteria during September 2014. 15 of those samples (10%) showed the presence of coiiform 
bacteria. The standard is that no more than 5 percent of our samples may do so. 

What should ! do? 

You do not need to boil your water or take other corrective actions. However, if you have specific health 
concerns, consult your doctor. People with severely compromised immune systems, infants, and some 
elderly may be at increased risk. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their 
healthcare providers. General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available 
from EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-300-426-4791. 

What does this mean? 

This is not an emergency. A portion of the City was notified to boil their water at the time of the incident 
until it was resolved. Coiiform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. 

Conforms are bacteria which are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that 
other, potentially harmful, bacteria may be present. Conforms were found in more samples than were 
allowed and this was a warning of potential problems. 

Usually, coliforms are a sign that there could be a problem with the system’s treatment or distribution 
system (pipes). Whenever we detect coiiform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if 
other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coiiform or E. coii, are present. We did not find any of 
these bacteria in our subsequent testing, and further testing shows that this problem has been resolved. 

What happened? What was done? On September 5, 2014, after routine and repeat samples showed 
the presence of total coiiform, a boil water order was issued to the affected area. That area was flushed 
and resampled until samples were non-detect for total coiiform. The boil order was lifted on September 9, 
2014. Samples collected since then show that all results met acceptable limits. 

For more information, please contact Mr. Brent Wright, Water Plant Supervisor, City Of Flint - DPW at

FLINT- Some Flint residents are complaining that the city’s water is causing skin problems for some children. 

Hundreds of people turned out Tuesday to discuss Flint’s water quality' at a meeting with the mayor and city council members. Flint resident Qiana 
Dawson said her 4-year-old and 2-year-o!d have broken out in rashes because of the water, resulting in high doctor’s bills. 

“You all need to work with me on money,” she said. 

LeeAnne Walters said her 3-year-old, who has a compromised immune system, has been suffering from skin problems after bathing in the water. 
“We got bad water,” said City Councilman Eric Mays, who hosted the meeting. “If you buy a bad product, you return it for a refund.” 

The meeting was held hours after demonstrators gathered outside Flint City Hal! to protest water quality and rising bills. The Flint Journal reported . 
The city insists the water is safe.

Some Flint residents complain of skin problems from water 

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said officials needs to focus on how to improve the water. 

“I’m talking with people about water every single day,” Walling said, “We need to work together as a community, with the cooperation of the state and 
federal government, to fix this issue.” 

Issues with the city’s water supply emerged after Flint stopped buying water from Detroit’s water department. Flint officials this month said they were 
dealing with elevated levels of a disinfection byproduct. 

Flint switched from using Lake Huron as its drinking water source in April. The city plans to use the Flint River as its water source until the end of 
2016, when the Karegnondi Water Authority expects to complete construction of a new Lake Huron water pipeline. 

Some want Flint to switch back to using Detroit’s water. 

Walling has supported the decision by state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley to hire a consultant to correct the treatment of water from the 
Flint River. Gev#Rick Snyder on Tuesday announced that Earley would be put in charge of the struggling Detroit Public Schools district. 

Earley said last week that going back to Detroit water was cost prohibitive and that the city “can ill-afford to switch course.”

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DRINKING WATER 


City of Flint Did Not Meet Treatment Requirements 

Our water system was recently found to be in violation of a drinking water standard. Although this incident was not 
an emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we are doing to correct this 
situation. 

We routinely monitor for the presence of drinking water contaminants. Samples were collected for total 
trihalomethanes {TTHM) analysis from eight locations on a quarterly basis (May 21, August 21, and November 20 of 
2014). The average of the results at ANY of the eight locations must not exceed the maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) for TTHMs, otherwise our water system exceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). The standard for 
TTHMs is 80 ug/L. The location reporting the highest TTHM level was 99 ug/L; thus, our water system exceeds the 
TTHM MCL. 

What should I do? 

« There is nothing you need to do unless you have a severely compromised immune system, have an infant, 
or are elderly. In that case, you may be at increased risk and should seek advice about drinking water from 
your health care provider. 

• You do not need to boi! your water or take other corrective actions. If a situation arises where the water is 
no longer safe to drink, you will be notified within 24 hours. 

What does this mean? 

This is not an emergency. If it had been an emergency, you would have been notified within 24 hours. 

People who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the MCL over many years may experience problems 
with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer. 

What is being done? 

We are currently working on solutions to correct the problem. We anticipate resolving the problem in 2015. 

For more information, please contact Mr. Brent Wright or Mike Glasgow at 810-787-6537 or the Water Plant at 4500 
North Dort Highway, Flint, Ml 48505. 

Please share this information with all the other people who drink this water, especially those who may not have 
received this notice directly (for example/ people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses). You can 
do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies by hand or mail. 

This notice is being sent to you by the City of Flint. 


CERTIFICATION: FI SB

City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests 
revealed too much disinfection byproduct 

Ron Fonger | rfongerl@mlive.com By Ron Fonger | rfongerl@mlive.com

FLINT, MI — The city says there's been too much disinfection byproduct in Flint's water system recently, 
something that — over many years could cause liver, kidney or central nervous system problems and an 
increased risk of cancer. 

The notice from the city says Flint water is safe to drink but warns those with "a severely compromised 
immune system, (who) have an infant or are elderly" that they "may be at increased risk and should seek 
advice about drinking water from your health care provider." 

For others, there is no need to boil water or take other actions, the notice says. 

"It 's been a rocky road," City Council President Josh Freeman said. "It's not acceptable. 

"People have a reasonable expectation that they are going to have quality drinking water. This is obviously 
going to rattle people." 

Mailed Friday, Jan. 2, the customer notices come after the state Department of Environmental Quality issued 
a notice of violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act for maximum contaminant levels for trihalomethanes — 
orTTHM — a group of four chemicals that are formed as a byproduct of disinfecting water. 

As city water plant operators used additional chlorine to fight bacteria in the Flint water system this summer, 
disinfectant byproduct levels also likely increased, city officials said Friday. 

Levels of TTHM have decreased since that time, and in Nov. 20, testing at eight locations showed only one 
that exceeded maximum contamination levels, according to the state's notice of violation. 

Testing on Aug. 21 showed contaminant levels were higher than maximum levels allowed at each of the 
same eight locations. 

"The water in our system today is not in violation" because of efforts to improve the distribution system and 
adjust water treatment, said Doughtery Johnson, utilities administrator at the Flint water treatment plant. 

Those changes "have likely contributed in part to the reduction in TTHM levels reported in the most recent

quarter, and suggest the city may be able to achieve compliance with the TTHM standard/' the state's 
violation notice says. 

City officials released a statement Friday saying its actions "appear to have corrected ... known compliance 
issues with the system, including a recent temporary increase in the maximum contamination level (MCL) of 
trihaiomethanes (TTHM) 

"Both the city of Flint and the MDEQ expect the corrective measures being implemented will resolve the 
issue by early 2015," the statement says. 

The city's recent violation for excessive disinfectant byproducts is the latest in a series of issues for the Flint 
water system since officials changed the water source pumped to homes and business from treated Lake 
Huron water purchased from the city of Detroit to water drawn directly from the Flint River and treated in 
Flint. 

The use of Flint River water is expected to be temporary because the city is a partner in the Karegnondi 
Water Authority, which is building a new water pipeline to Lake Huron. 

Once that system is put into service, something that's expected to happen by the end of 2016, Flint will be 
in a position to return to using lake water. 

Freeman said that long-term plan remains "the right path to be on" and said the city appears to be on 
course to fix the problem of disinfection byproduct levels, but Councilman Eric Mays called on the City 
Council to hold an inquiry about drinking water quality. 

"Sworn information given under oath is the only information I trust," Mays said. 

Residents have complained to the council about the smell and taste of the water since Flint stopped the flow 
of lake water here and there were three boil water advisories in a 22-day span this summer after positive 
tests for total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria. 

In October, General Motors announced that it would no longer use treated river water at its engine plant 
here because of fears high chloride levels would cause corrosion. 

Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft said that the city's aging water distribution system 
remains the biggest obstacle to meeting Safe Drinking Water standards but officials have also said the 
relatively low quality of untreated river water and the need to more carefully manage chemical treatment 
has also been a factor. 

Croft told a City Council committee in September that river water has proven hard to treat and to keep safe 
because of variables that wouldn't be factors in lake water, like temperature fluctuation and rain.

But Croft said the city has made improvements to its distribution system and said additional improvements 
are on the way, including pipe replacements, leak detection and hydraulic monitoring. 

Johnson said the size of Flint's water system, which once served more than 200,000 people and now serves 
about half that number, also makes keeping water fresh in distribution pipes difficult. 

Stagnant water is more susceptible to contamination, officials have said. 

Flint will remain in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act until every test site in the city has acceptable 
levels of disinfectant byproducts, Johnson and Croft said. 

The next round of testing is scheduled to take place in February.

Lower TTHM levels put Flint in compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act

Lower TTHM levels put Flint in compliance with Safe Drinking 
Water Act

FLINT, MI — The city is no longer in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act because the level of 
total trihalomethanes in water samples collected last month has fallen, the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality says. 

The DEQ notified the city of the test results in a letter Wednesday, Sept. 2, ending eight months of the city 
under a violation of the act. The city will no longer have to send water customers warning notices about 
TTHM levels. 

"Creative measures by the city have been successful in achieving compliance with this standard," reads the 
letter from Michael F. Prysby of the DEQ. "These measures have included replacement of anthracite filter 
media with granular activated carbon as well as the optimization of water treatment plant and distribution 
system processes and operations as recommended through operational evaluations conducted by the city. 

"It is important that the city continue to follow these recommendations in order to limit disinfection 
byproduct formation and maintain compliance (with state requirements)," the letter says. "While 
(requirements have) now been met at all eight compliance sampling sites, an individual TTHM concentration 
above (80 parts per billion) was measured at one location ... in August 2015." 

The location of the highest TTHM test in August was at Salem Housing, 3216 King Boulevard, which 
registered 90 ppb. Flint's violation of the federal law was the result of the annua! average of TTHM above 80 
ppb at a minimum of one of the eight testing locations. 

City officials have said they expected improved TTHM levels after the installation of the new $1.6 million 
carbon filter this summer. 

"The city of Flint is continuing to improve its water system, including both the areas of treatment and 
distribution," Mayor Dayne Walling said in a news release issued by the city Thursday, Aug. 3. 

TTHM is a colorless, odorless byproduct of chlorinating water with high levels of total organic carbon. The 
city began having problems managing TTHM after it began using the Flint River as its water source in April 
2014.

Lower TTHM levels put Flint in compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act 


Page 2 of 2 


In past notices mailed to Flint water customers, the city has warned that drinking water with excess 
amounts of TTHM can pose increased health risks for those with a compromised immune system, the elderly, 
pregnant women and infants. 

The good news on TTHM comes the day after researchers at Virginia Tech published an online report, saying 
tests show Flint drinking water is "very corrosive" and is "causing lead contamination in homes." 

A statement from Walling on the lead issue says the city will work with the DEQ on a plan aimed at reducing 
the corrosive effects of water on older transmission pipes and home service lines.

Scary: Leaded Water and One Flint Family’s 
Toxic Nightmare 


July 9th, 2015, 11:28 PM

Curt Guyette is an investigative reporter for the ACLU of Michigan. His work, funded by a grant from the Ford 
Foundation, focuses on emergency management and open government. He writes regularly for Michigan 
Democracy Watch Blog, (http://www.aclumich.org/democracywatch/index.php/entry/hard-to-swallow-toxic-water- 
in-a-toxic-system) 

By Curt Guyette 

It took a while for LeeAnne Waiters to realize the full impact of the 

Walters — a stay-at home mom with four sons and a husband in 
the Navy — had seen other numbers reflecting the quality of 
drinking water at her Flint home that were devastating. But 
13,200? She’d never seen anything like this. 

The city had tested her water twice in this past March and both 
times found dangerously high levels of lead — 104 parts per 
billion (ppb) and 397 ppb, respectively. 

Those numbers filled her with dread, because they meant her family had been exposed to high 
levels of a terribly toxic heavy metal that put her children’s future in jeopardy. 

But it was the result of a third test of the tap water in her home, performed by independent 
experts at Virginia Tech University, that most stunned Walters. 

"It took a while for me to wrap my head around it,” said Waiters. 

The VT researchers discovered lead levels in Walters’ water reached a jaw-dropping 13,200 
ppb — more than twice the amount at which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies 


number: 13,200.

water as hazardous waste. 

“When I saw those numbers I was shocked,” said Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, a 
former MacArthur Fellow and respected authority on corrosion in drinking-water systems, who 
oversaw the tests. 

Edwards played a key role in discovering and addressing the problem of corroded water pipes 
and lead in Washington, D.C. during the early 2000s, in what's described as the worst 
contamination crisis ever seen in a major urban water system. 

In terms of lead levels, the Walters family's numbers eclipsed even the worst D.C. homes. 

“I have never in my 25-year career seen such outrageously high levels going into another home 
in the United States,” said Edwards. “This was literally hazardous-waste levels.” 

But the condition of Walters’ tap water raises a much more far-reaching question: Since the city 
moved away from Detroit’s water system and began pumping water from the Flint River, how 
many other families have been put at risk by the city’s questionable testing procedures and 
handling of the water supply? 

The Walters family surely isn’t alone in dealing with the threat of lead-laced drinking water. Flint 
has tens of thousands of homes that are a half-century old or older, built at a time when water 
service lines were typically made of lead. 

And according to various experts, including an EPA water-quality specialist, the city’s actions are 
only exacerbating the threat. 

“What the public needs is accurate information,” explained Miguel Del Toral, regulations manager 
for the Ground Water and Drinking Water Branch of the EPA's Region 5. 

Instead, the city is utilizing testing measures that almost ensure that worst-case scenarios such 
as the one facing the Walters family escape detection, asserted Del Toral in an internal EPA 
memo provided to the ACLU of Michigan. 

Compounding the threat is what Del Toral describes as the continued inability of officials to 
adequately treat water coming into people's homes from the Flint River. 

“I don’t want to scare people unnecessarily," said Del Toral in a phone interview from his home in 
Chicago. “But there is absolutely a problem in Flint that needs to be addressed right away.” 

During his interview with the ACLU of Michigan, Del Toral said he was willing to go on the record 
with his concerns, but that he was doing so as a private citizen, not as a representative of the 
EPA. 

EPA rules, he said, required that such interviews be routed through the agency’s public affairs 
people. But he's willing to speak out nonetheless, he said, because of the potential harm to the 
public is so great, 

WATERING DOWN THE TESTS 

Perhaps the most vexing problem in all of this is the contamination caused by the city’s 
decades-old network of lead and iron pipes — a problem directly connected to the switch to river

water, and the city’s failure to adequately treat it. 

Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules, if 
lead reaches a level of 1 5 parts per billion in water, the source 
of the problem must be identified and corrected. 

In early March, after months of requests (and only after Walters 
had received a doctor’s note raising concerns about problems 
with the water), the city finally conducted a test. It found lead 
levels of 1 04 ppb the first time. A second test recorded a level 
of 397 ppb. 

Blood tests, taken after those water-sample numbers were reported, revealed that one of her 
children, a four year old, had lead poisoning. 

The news was devastating, said Walters, and the concern it creates for her child’s future is 
haunting. 

“Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body,” according to the EPA’s web site. 
“Children six years old and younger are most susceptible ... Even low levels of lead in the blood 
of children can result in: behavior and learning problems; lower IQ and hyperactivity; slowed 
growth; and hearing problems.” 

Those dangers made Walters all the more determined to get her questions answered. 

For one thing, she wanted to know why residents were being instructed to “pre-flush” water lines 
before drawing samples that would be tested by the city 

After much searching, she found Del Toral at the EPA’s Region 5 in Chicago. He explained to her 
that her instincts were right, and that she had good cause to be concerned about the way testing 
was being done. 

“The practice of pre-flushing before collecting compliance samples has been shown to result in 
the minimization of lead capture and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water,” 
wrote Del Toral in an internal memo dated June 24. 

Del Toral went on to say that the city’s testing methods were a “serious concern” because they 
“could provide a false sense of security to the residents of Flint regarding lead levels in the 
water.” As a result, he warned, residents could fail to take the necessary precautions to protect 
their families from lead in the drinking water. 

Virginia Tech’s Edwards completely agrees with Del Toral’s assessment. 

“The net effect of a ‘pre-flush’ is to greatly reduce the likelihood of detecting lead in samples 
collected ... that would normally be present in the consumers drinking water,” Edwards wrote in 
an email. “I have long maintained that the practice should be banned, as it artificially iowers the 
amount of lead detected in samples versus typical consumer exposure.” 

Asked about these concerns, city spokesman Jason Lorenz offered the following email reply: 
“While I cannot directly respond to Mr. Del Toral's remarks without first contacting the EPA

Region 5 office, I can say that the City of Flint follows all the testing procedures and schedules as 
required by the U.S. EPA.” 

He added that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) endorses the city’s 
sampling method. The MDEQ did not respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking its comments 
on the controversy. 

Del Toral contended in an interview that what Flint’s doing is actually exploiting a "loophole” in the 
law. 

“From a technical standpoint, there’s no justification for the way Flint is conducting its tests," Del 
Toral said. “Any credible scientist will tell you [the city’s] method is not the way to catch 
worst-case conditions." 

There is no legitimate reason for the city’s methodology, said Del Toral. 

During his interview with the ACLU of Michigan, Del Toral said he was willing to go on the record 
with his concerns, but that he was doing so as a private citizen, not as a representative of the 
EPA. 

EPA rules, he said, required that such interviews be routed through the agency’s public affairs 
people. But he was willing to speak out nonetheless, he said, because of the potential harm to 
the public. 

FLUSHING OUT REAL ANSWERS 

it was Del Toral who, after determining that the lead problem plaguing the Walters family was 
coming from outside their home, connected LeeAnne with Edwards at Virginia Tech. 

Instead of taking a single sample after a line had been “pre-flushed” under the city’s direction, 
Edwards instructed Walters to collect a series of samples from water that had been allowed to sit 
in the service line long enough to accurately reflect levels the family could be exposed to under 
normal use. 

(Meanwhile, that same service line, dug up and replaced after the sample collection, was found 
to be made of lead in one section and iron in another.) 

Edwards tested the water and discovered that the lead contamination ranged from 200 ppb to the 
13,200 ppb figure that stunned LeeAnne Walters — and should likewise shock many others. 

Given the age of much of Flint’s infrastructure, Edwards agrees with Del Toral’s assessment that 
the test results they found at the Walters home amount to an alarm going off, and others in the 
city need to pay attention. 

“1 do not see any reason why there would not be serious problems occurring in at least some 
other Flint homes,” said Edwards. 

In 1986, the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act was amended to prohibit the use of lead pipes in public 
water systems. Every house built before that is potentially at risk, said Edwards. About half of 
Flint’s roughly 40,000 homes are at least 50 years old. 

Making things worse is the fact that the high levels of chlorine being used to treat Flint’s dirty river

water lead to the creation of a carcinogenic byproduct know as total trihalomenhanes, or TTH7M. 
To keep TTHM levels down, the city is adding ferric chloride. The trouble is, that additive can also 
accelerate the corrosion of lead and iron pipes. 

Adding yet another layer to the problem is something the city is not doing. 

According to Del Toral, Flint should be adding corrosion-control chemicals designed to help keep 
lead and copper in pipes from leaching into drinking water. Doing so is required by federal 
regulations, wrote Del Toral in his memo. 

“To our knowledge, that is inaccurate,” said Flint spokesman Lorenz. “Before the plant was 
placed in operation, the City (and our engineering firm) had numerous discussions with DEQ 
personnel and inquired if corrosion-control chemicals - typically phosphates -needed to be 
included in the treatment process. The use of these chemicals was not required or mandated." 

What’s indisputable is this: 

Flint’s water contained corrosion-control chemicals until Aprii 2014, when Flint’s ties to the Detroit 
water system were severed. Flint officials hailed that changeover as a cost-cutting move for a city 
facing a financial crisis so severe it had been placed under the control of a state-appointed 
emergency manager. 

Discontinuing the use of the anti-corrosion chemicals allowed toxic scale built up on the insides 
of pipes over the past decades to be released into water flowing into people’s homes, explained 
Dei Toral. 

In his memo, Del Toral warned: “The lack of mitigating treatment is especially concerning as the 
high lead levels [that result] will likely not be reflected in the City of Flint’s compliance samples 
due to sampling procedures used...” 

In other words, at the same time the city is exacerbating the problem, it’s conducting tests that 
will probably fail to identity the true extent of the threat. 

Del Toral described the situation as a “major concern.” 

“in the absence of any corrosion control treatment, lead levels in drinking water can be expected 
to increase,” he warned in his memo. 

The EPA offered Fiint officials the use of agency experts to help get the situation under control, 
said Del Toral, but added that, to his knowledge, the city has so far declined all help. 

LeeAnne Waiters said that when she asked why city officials weren’t taking the EPA's offer of 
assistance, she was told, “We don’t need it.” 

Flint spokesman Lorenz, on the other hand, maintained that “the city continues to work closely 
with the MDEQ and the EPA Regional Office.” 

As for Walters’s family, that the city has finally replaced the service line leading to their home, 
and lead levels have dropped below the 15 ppb EPA action level. 

The problem now, she said, is that water currently coming out of her tap tinged yellow and smells 
of rotten eggs. City officials have given her no explanation as to the possible cause of that.

It is just one more in a long list of questions that need to be addressed. 

“What we need,” said Walters, “are more answers." 

But it’s not just answers the people of Flint require. 

They also need solutions. And, as Del Torai’s EPA memo emphasizes, they need them 
immediately.

Lead leaches Into 'very corrosive 1 Flint drinking water,

FLINT, MI — Flint drinking water is "very 
corrosive" and "causing lead contamination 
in homes," researchers from Virginia Tech 
University reported online Wednesday, Sept. 2. 


Flint Journal file photo 


"On a scientific basis, Flint River water leaches more lead from plumbing than does Detroit water," the report 
concludes. "This is creating a public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead solder." 


The Virginia Tech report comes as students there, overseen by Professor Marc Edwards, are in the final days 
of testing water collected from 300 sample kits distributed to Flint residents. 

On Monday, Aug. 31, the researchers reported 42 percent of 120 initial samples from Fiint had lead levels 
that were more than 5 parts per billion, "which suggests a serious lead-in-water problem, according to our 
experience and criteria." 

Virginia Tech was initially contacted by a Flint resident who had concerns about lead in Flint water. It has 
been working with citizen groups in Flint such as Water You Fighting For. 

Twenty percent of the first samples also exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lead action limit 
of 15 ppb, the report said. 

The EPA requires water systems like Flint's to collect tap samples from sites that are more likely to have 
plumbing materials containing lead. 

If more than 10 percent of samples exceed 15 ppb, then water systems are required to take action, 
including steps to optimize corrosion control treatment. 


Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many years in products found in and around homes, according to 
EPA. 


"Even at low levels, lead may cause a range of health effects, including behavioral problems and learning 
disabilities," EPA's website says. "Children 6 years old and under are most at risk because this is when the

brain is developing. " 

The Virginia Tech report on Flint River water comes two days after representatives of three organizations 
delivered more than 26,000 online petition signatures to Mayor Dayne Walling, demanding the city end 

its use of the Flint River and reconnect the city to the Detroit water system. 

The petition language says high lead levels are one reason the city should no longer use the river as a 
drinking water source. 

Walling and Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft issued statements in response to questions 
about lead in Flint water Wednesday after Croft declined to discuss the issue in a news conference Tuesday. 

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz said the two would not comment further Wednesday. 

"The city of Flint is currently in compliance with the safety mandates of the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality and continues to work with them to stay in compliance with all safety and quality 
standards," Croft's statement said. "We have also been in constant contact with Virginia Tech, sharing 
information as it becomes available." 

Walling, who has supported Flint's continued use of the Flint River as a drinking water source, said, "Lead 
can be a concern in communities with older public and private infrastructure. 

"The city of Fiint has offered free and independent testing to residents since spring, and I encourage people 
to use this service if they have questions," Walling's statement said. 

Edwards, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, said the elevated lead levels he has seen in 
Fiint tap water are tied to a corrosive water source that contains about eight times more chloride than 
Detroit water does. 

"Chloride is generally considered to be very corrosive to iron. For instance, chloride present in road salts 
applied in the winter causes iron in cars and bridges to rust," the Virginia Tech team's website says. 

"This could be a huge public health problem. ... The Flint water just ate the pipe up," Edwards said of the 
testing he has overseen so far. 

In the testing, researchers took copper pipe pieces joined with lead solder inside them, according to the 
report, which says lead solder is probably present in plumbing systems of many Flint homes built before 
1986. 

Lead solder-copper pipe test pieces were placed in containers filled with water from Detroit and Flint in the 
experiment, according to the report.

"If it were me, I would not be using (Flint River water) for cooking or drinking unless I had it tested for 
lead," said Edwards, who previously mounted a six-year campaign that succeeded in forcing the U.S. 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to admit it had misled the public about the risk of lead in the 
Washington, D.C., area's drinking water, according to The Washington Post. 

"Bottled or filtered water (is what I would use for) children under 6 years old or if I was pregnant," he said. 

Brad Wurfel, communications director for the state Department of Environmental Quality, said the 
preliminary water testing results from Virginia Tech don't jibe with two separate rounds of testing during the 
past year by the city. 

That testing indicated "Flint drinking water meets state and federal safe drinking water standards," Wurfel 
said. 

Wurfel said lead levels detected in testing are not the result of water containing lead when it leaves Flint's 
treatment plant, But he said the state "has requested Flint optimize its water treatment to further limit 
exposure to lead from plumbing in homes." 

The concerns about lead are the latest challenge for the Flint water system since the city started using the 
Flint River to replace Lake Huron water sold by the city of Detroit in April 2014. 

Since the switch, the city has been plagued by issues such as water main breaks and boil water advisories 
because of bacteria and has been in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of high levels of total 
trihalomethanes (TTHM), a byproduct of chlorinating river water. 

The Rev. Allen Overton, who hand-delivered petitions to Walling on Monday, asking that city officials 
reconnect the Flint water system to Detroit, said Wednesday that the Virginia Tech experiment is more 
evidence Flint is not using the best quality of water available. 

"We have a major health issue here, (and) they are not being honest with the citizens of Flint," Overton 
said. 

City Council President Josh Freeman said the city has been willing to provide customers with free water 
testing and has taken action — such as installing a new $1.6 million filtration system — to address problems 
such as TTHM. 

Councilman Eric Mays said, as more water testing is done, it becomes clearer that Flint should be negotiating 
with Detroit for a new, short-term water contract as work continues on the Karegnondi Water Authority 
pipeline. 

The pipeline, a partnership between the city and Genesee County, is expected to bring untreated Lake Huron

We are now three weeks into our laboratory experiment w.r.t. testing the 
relative corrosivity- of Flint River water versus Detroit water 
(http://fiintwaterstudv.org/2015/09/flint-rivers-water-is-verv-corrosive-to- 
lead-and-causing-lead-contamination-in-homes/) . As the test continues, it 
becomes a more accurate measure of the relative corrosivity of the two 
waters. We previously noted, that it would be expected that Flint River water 
would be much more corrosive than Detroit water, due to its higher chloride 
content.

Experiment: When we visited Flint, we took pieces of copper pipe joined 
with lead solder (old solder is 50% lead by weight 

(http://www.copper.Org/environment/water/e p lead.html)) inside them. 

Lead solder is probably present in the plumbing of many Detroit/Flint homes 
built before 1986 when it was banned from use in drinking water systems 
(http://www.copper.org/environment/water/e__p_lead.html) . We put the 
lead solder-copper pipe test pieces in 250 mL containers, and filled them 
with the following three waters: 

Test l) Detroit water 

Test 2) Current Flint River water 

Test 3) Current Flint River water with orthophosphate (a typical corrosion 
inhibitor (http://www.lenntech.com/ products /chemicals/water-treatment- 
chemicals.htm#Corrosion%20inhibitors)) 

Test 3 was conducted, to see if adding orthophosphate to Flint River water 
would stop lead corrosion. About 50% of water companies in the U.S. add 
orthophosphate to their water to control lead corrosion, but it is not 
currently added to Flint River water.

Figure 1 - Data from Week 3 comparing lead corrosion in Detroit water (left), current Flint water 
(middle), and Flint water with orthophosphate (right) 


From the data shown above in Figure 1, it is clear that Detroit water is much 
less corrosive to lead solder than the Flint River water. On average, Detroit 
water is 19 times (or 19X) less corrosive than the Flint River water 
currently in use. That is, the current Flint River water leaches 19X more 
lead to the water than Detroit water. This explains why the lead in Flint’s 
water in our survey, is so high, (http:/ /flintwaterstudy.org/information-for- 
flint-residents/results-for-citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/) even when it 
was low before when Detroit water was being used. 

We can actually still see the high lead in the Flint River water test by eye (Le- 
as white particles suspended in the water 

(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/09/flint-rivers-water-is-verv-corrosive-to-

with Flint River water, were slightly above hazardous waste levels (5000 
ppb), which is still lower than the worst levels of lead we detected in the

home of Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters 

(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/08/hazardous-waste-levels-of-lead-found- 
in-a-flint-households-water f ) . 

Orthophosphate still does not seem to help stop lead leaching in Flint 
River water, which is also consistent with expectations based on 
experiments in high chloride water 

(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010938X1100Q382) . 

There is a slight improvement, but even with phosphate, Flint River water 
has 16 times more lead compared to the same condition using Detroit water. 

We will continue to run these tests, but at present it does not seem like 
orthophosphate will provide a quick answer to the very high lead levels in 
Flint water. 

Conclusion: On a scientific basis, Flint River water leaches more lead 
from plumbing than does Detroit water as predicted before 
(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/08/why-is-it-possible-that-flint-river- 
water-cannot-be-treated-to-meet-federal-standards/) . This is creating a 
public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead 
solder. Unfortunately, adding orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor to 
the Flint River water, does not solve the lead problem. 


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS 


We believe, that in the weeks and months ahead, MDEQ and Flint will be 
forced to admit they failed to protect public health as required under the 
Federal Lead and Copper Rule. The question that will then be asked is “What 
can be done to protect residents?” 

Step 1: Issue Scientifically Sound Advice. 


http://flintwaterstudy.org/20 1 5 /09/test-update-flint-river- water- 1 9x-more-corrosive-than~d. . . 1 0/2/20 1 5 




Test Update: Flint River water 19X more corrosive than Detroit water for Lead Solder; N... Page 5 of 12 

The first step is to admit that the water in Flint is not safe for cooking or 
drinking (http://flintwaterstudv.org/information-for-flint- 
residents/results-for-citizen-testing-for-lead~300~kits/) — a fact that MDEQ 
still denies. According to MDEQ statements provided to reporter Ronald 
Fonger this week, which were presented to us for comment, MDEQ’s Brad 
Wurfel asserts that: 


“the issue here isn’t Flint’s water source or water plants. It’s the high 
number of older homes with lead pipes and lead service 
connections.,, .Folks who have concerns should get a water specialist to 
take a look at their home and see what they need to do to achieve 
peace of mind, because lead and copper are home plumbing problems 
that no water source can eliminate entirely.” 


We note that this is the exact same position that MDEQ and the city took 
months ago, after Lee-Anne Walters* child was lead poisoned from exposure 
to high lead in Flint water (http:/ / www.abcl2.com/home/headlines/Flint- 
mother-said-the-water-gave-her-son-Lead-poisoning-3 244965 5 1 .html) . After 
MDEQ and the City blamed Ms. Walters home plumbing for the problem, an 
EPA water specialist did come to her home and inspected her plumbing. His 
finding: There were no lead plumbing sources in her home 
(http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/file/EPAWaterReportQ62415.pdf) . 
How does that finding, provide Ms. Walters and other Flint residents, with 
“peace of mind?” 

Likewise, during our sampling events in Flint homes 
(http://flintwaterstudv.org/information-for-flint-residents/results-for- 
citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/) . we are finding very high lead in other 
homes with modern lead free plumbing, which again points to city owned 
lead pipes and corrosive water as the problem. 


http://flintwaterstudy.org/20 1 5/09/test-update-flint-river- water- 1 9x-raore-corrosive-than-d. .. 1 0/2/20 1 5 




Test Update: Flint River water 19X more corrosive than Detroit water for Lead Solder; N... Page 6 of 12 


On the basis of these facts, we consider MDEQ’s position to be both 
unscientific and irresponsible, and we stand by our 
recommendations to Flint consumers, that they immediately reduce 
their exposure to high lead in Flint’s water by implementing 
protective measures when using tap water for drinking or cooking. 


Step 2. Implement Corrosion Control. 

The second step will ultimately require some sort of corrosion control 
treatment to reduce lead in Flint water. Three options are possible as 
detailed below: 

1. Switch back to the non-corrosive Detroit water. It is our opinion, 
based on years of experience, that Flint’s lead levels would drop 
markedly in about one month. 

2. Add orthophosphate to Flint River water. As indicated in this work, 
orthophosphate will not reduce lead leaching from all lead plumbing 
sources. On the basis of our extensive experience, we would only expect 
modest improvements to water lead levels if orthophosphate was 
added. 

3. Wait for KWA pipeline. If orthophosphate was added to water from 
the KWA pipeline, it would be about the same corrosivity as Detroit 
water (Option A). In that case, Flint residents will have to live with the 
very high lead in their water, until at least one month after the pipeline 
is connected. 

Politicians and residents will ultimately have to look at which of the above 
options is best for Flint, after weighing feasibility and costs.

Lead levels in Flint water spiked after switch to river, state 
records show

FLINT, MI -- City officials insist their 
own testing shows Flint water is 
safe and within federal guidelines 
for lead. 


Flint Journal file photo 


But those same tests also show lead levels have been rising since the city began using the Flint River 
for water 16 months ago. 

The results of Flint’s testing for lead since 1992, released by the state Department of Environmental 
Quality to The Flint Journal-MLive, show 10 percent of homes sampled in the city's most recent 
testing contained 11 parts per billion or more of lead, with six of 69 samples exceeding the federal 
lead limit of 15 ppb. 

Those are the highest lead levels measured in Flint by the city in more than 20 years, the state data 
shows. 


In contrast, the city's tests of Lake Huron water from Detroit for one 10-year period -- from June 
2001 until September 2011 -- resulted in just one of 155 samples registering higher than 15 ppb of 
lead. 


Flint began treating river water in April 2014 after Detroit terminated an expired contract for selling 
water to the city. The cutoff came after Flint joined Genesee County to form the Karegnondi Water 
Authority, which is building a new pipeline to Lake Huron, a project that's expected to be completed 
sometime next year. 

City and state officials have pointed to their own testing as evidence that Flint water is safe and 
under the 15 ppb limit, but have said little about the lead level drifting up. 

Marc Edwards, who is supervising separate water testing in Flint by Virginia Tech University, 
said there's no mistaking the pattern.

Lead levels in Flint water spiked after switch to river, state recor... http://blog.mlive.com/newsnow_impact/print.html?entry=/2015... 


"The Flint River -- based on the chemistry — has an obvious propensity for lead to be released to 
water," Edwards said. "There should have been red lights flashing (when the city began using the 
river in April 2014) — knowing that if you put that water into Flint's system without corrosion control, 
you're going to see a massive lead release." 

That release is what Edwards' testing has shown as 10 percent of homes sampled by students and 
faculty from Virginia Tech have had lead levels of at least 25 ppb. 

Since the testing started, Mayor Dayne Walling announced Flint would speed up development of a 
plan for reducing corrosiveness of city water and called for $10 million in state funds to begin 
replacing lead and lead solder in water service lines and plumbing. 

Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft would not attribute higher lead levels to the 
river alone, but said the source of the water is one variable as is the amount of time water is 
stagnant in pipes, 

"Lead is in there. It's always been there," Croft said. "We would like there to be no lead, (but) I'm 
happy how aggressively we are responding" to what the city has. 

Steve Busch, Lansing and Jackson district supervisor in the DEQ's office of drinking water and 
municipal assistance, said lead testing results vary in many areas and a shift doesn't necessarily 
show Flint River water is more susceptible to higher lead levels than lake water. 

"We see numbers fluctuate with the same treatment and the same water," Busch said. "We have 
levels go up and down from monitoring round to monitoring round." 

Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many year in products found in and around homes, according 
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Even at low levels, lead may cause health effects such 
as behavioral problems and learning disabilities. 

Current regulations for lead in water began in 1992 and require a limited amount of testing to 
measure the degree to which lead leaches into tap water after flowing through lead service lines and 
lead solder in home plumbing. 

If more than 10 percent of tap water samples from water systems exceed 15 ppb, the water system 
can be required to take steps like making water less corrosive or replacing lead service lines. 

Since the EPA announced its lead and copper rule in 1991, Flint has collected 33 samples every six to 
36 months but the number of tests increased after the city changed its water source to the river,

Lead levels in Flint water spiked after switch to river, state recor... http://blog.mlive.com/newsnow_impact/print.html?entiy=/2015... 


according to state data. 

State records show 100 samples were collected from Flint in the last six months of 2014, showing 
two sites with readings of more than 15 ppb of lead and 10 percent of homes registering at 6 ppb or 
more. 

From January until June this year, the city collected just 69 samples, a reduction that was allowed 
because Flint's population had dropped below 100,000, Busch said. 

The last time testing by the city showed a higher percentage of water samples above 11 parts per 
biilion was 1992, immediately after new lead and copper rules went into effect. 

In that case, the city of Detroit took five years to develop a plan to better control corrosion and lead 
levels and brought lead levels down from a high of 15 ppb in 10 percent of samples taken in Flint.

The water in Flint is likely poisoning kids. 

That’s what pediatricians in the city say, after looking at lead levels in young children before 
and after the city switched the source of its drinking water from the Detroit water system to 
the Flint River.

There's a long list of complaints about Flint's water. But physicians are really concerned about this one.

“My research shows that lead levels have gone up. I cannot say it’s from the water, but that’s 
the thing that has happened," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician with Hurley 
Children’s Hospital. 

Hanna-Attisha says she decided to look into blood-lead levels after researchers from 
Virginia Tech found elevated lead levels in tap water due to the corrosive nature of the river 
water. 

She analyzed blood test results of 1,746 children age five and younger from Flint, and 1,670 
non-Flint children. Before the switch, 2.1% of Flint children had elevated blood lead levels. 
After the switch, that rate jumped to 4%. By comparison, the rate for non-Flint children 
went from .6% to 1%, which Hanna-Attisha says is statistically insignificant. 

She calls the city’s response to water quality problems “inadequate,” and says precautions 
need to be taken immediately. 


“Because the impact of not doing anything will haunt us for years to come,” says Hanna- 
Attisha, citing interventions like special education, lost productivity, and incarceration costs 
associated with high lead levels. “The cost will be astronomical in decades to come. So we 
cannot wait until this year or next year. We have to think five years from now, ten years 
from now." 

Hanna-Attisha and other physicians are urging the city to issue an advisory about how to 
minimize exposure to lead in the water. The county health department says it’s drafting that 
advisory now. 

The news about the elevated lead levels did not surprise Lee Anne Walters. She found out 
her son had alarmingly high lead levels in April of this year. 


“I kept talking to the doctors, trying to figure out why he wasn’t growing,” says Walters. "He 
was 27 pounds at four years old. His hair was thinning, breaking out in rashes." 

Walters says her son would get a rash when he took baths. There would be a line on his body 
that corresponded with where the bath water ended. Above it, his skin was fine. Below it, 
where his skin was underwater, he’d get a rash.

“The doctors in the city gave me a hard time testing my kids,” says Walters. “I took them out 
the city to a dermatologist down in Brighton, who ran the test and called me personally to 
tell me that he did have lead poisoning and anemia from the lead poisoning, and he's having 
speech problems.” 

It turns out the rash was probably from a chlorine byproduct the city had to dump into the 
river water to kill the E. coli that had made people sick the summer before. 

People knew that chemical - it’s called TTHM - was a problem. But lead wasn’t on many 
people’s radar until a guy named Marc Edwards came to town. 

Edwards is a researcher from Virginia Tech. 

His tests of Flint tap water found lead levels 
in some homes that were higher than federal 
regulators allow - and a lot higher than the 
city found in the tests it conducted. He says 
the river water is so corrosive it’s eating the 
lead from old pipes and solder. 

"That’s why we are actually asking for 

funding to help with infrastructure,” said Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson. "It’s 
not a secret that the city is very financially distressed." 

Henderson and other city officials say they’re working with state and federal regulators to 
get a handle on the problem. 

But they’re quick to point out that the city's own tests show it's in compliance with the Safe 
Drinking Water Act. 

But activists say they don't trust how the city arrived at that conclusion, and point to the 
Virginia Tech results as evidence that the city has been conducting flawed testing. 

"I want them to take responsibility,” says Lee Anne Walters, the mother whose son has 
experienced health problems since the switch. "I want them to quit poisoningtheir citizens.” 


”1 want them to take 
responsibility. ! want them 
to quit poisoning their 
citizens.”

michigan man • 

Let's be clear.. .this situation is at least partly a result of massive cuts in state revenue 
sharing, which led the city to take dramatic steps to cut its costs... and now people are 
paying the price. But hey, we cut taxes at the state level (and our per cap income is still 
in the bottom 15 in the nation). 


Allison MacArthur-Ruesink • 

This has nothing to do with Cost Cuts. The MDEQ is rife with corruption, 
perhaps the "employee" who had oversight of this facility was also 
hired and promoted based upon a family connection with a member of the Water 
Division's "Hot Tub Club" instead of experience and education!? I 
complained about the problems as far back as the early 2000's, even to Governor 
Grandholm's husband via Reading for Leading. Nothing was corrected !! Employees 
who speak out are harassed mercilessly and even worse as in my case. When I did 
not voluntarily retire after being asked 3x by MDEQ’s Jon E. Russell, he conspired 
and fabricated a case to get rid of me!! I took a polygraph from Forensic 
Polygraph Services (Mr. Neil Myers) to prove I was telling the truth 

but Michigan's corrupt Attorney General Bill Schuette and his equally corrupt 
Assistant AG Joseph Yung-Kung Ho (P-77390) have denied me any measure of 
Justice!! It is not a coincidence that the Judge involved with my case Thomas 
Wilson Jackson County Michigan used to work for the AG's Office. Everything was 
filed in a timely manner!! The MDEQ have even refused my receiving copies of my 
OWN PERSONNEL FILE! This is Michigan's way of saying "Thanks for 30 years 
of Service" They pulled this BS 65 days before my 55th birthday so they 
could deny my collecting my Retirement Benefits before age 60. Does someone 
have to die before the Bureaucracy cleans its own house?! Read "Well of 
Lies" about how inept and unqualified public servants who are unqualified 
or just plain corrupt, can injure innocent people!!

Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch

Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch 


6:44 pan. EDT September 25 r 2015 

with lead poisoning jumps after Flint water switch, says researcher. 

Flint's ongoing water woes are now associated with an immediate and irreversible danger — possible lead 
poisoning of some of the city's children, according to a review of blood lest results by a Hurley Children’s 
Hospital pediatrician. 

"I was hoping not to find anything, but what we found ... is concerning," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha who also 
leads the pediatric residency program at Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine, 

This is not something you mess around with,” she said. “Our population already has so many issues from 
poverty, from unemployment, from violence.” 

State officials say their own review of blood test results have not shown the same increase that Hanna-Attisha found. Moreover, water tests have similarly 
shown lead within federally accepted levels, they say. 

Hanna-Attisha examined results from blood samples of Genesee County children taken both before and after the city ended its water contract with the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department fhtto://www.dwsd.oroA and began pulling water from the Flint River. 

The number of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels — 5 micrograms per deciliter or more — jumped from 2.1% in the 20 months prior to Sept. 

15, 2013, to 4.0% between Jan. 1 and Sept. 15 this year. In certain ZIP Codes, the change was even more troubling, she said — jumping from 2.5% of 
the children tested to 6.3%. 

Blood is often drawn by pediatricians as part of routine lead-level testing, especially among children who are on Medicaid. That gave Hanna-Attisha 1,746 
test results from Flint children to compare against 1 ,640 results from elsewhere in Genesee County. Children in Genesee County outside of Flint showed 
{ no significant increase in blood-lead levels. 

Health officials have said no lead levels are safe fhttD://www.cdc.aov/nceh/leadA . Lead can lead to serious developmental problems, reducing a child's IQ 
and causing serious behavioral and emotional problems. Though levels can fall in individuals over time, the damage is permanent. 

If Hanna-Attisha's analysis is correct, this upward trend in Flint interrupts years of progress in reducing dangerous blood-lead levels. 

State data show that the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels have been falling for years. In fact in 2013, 3.6% of Flint children 
younger than 6 had elevated blood-lead levels, compared with the state-wide rate of 3.9%. 

Though Hanna-Attisha's review didn't try to determine cause, “we can't think of another reason' for the trend other than the change in Flint's water 
source. 

The review is sure to ratchet up tension in Flint. 

In 201 4, city officials ended the city's contract f/s1orv/news/local/michigan/2015/01/22/water-woes-l3test-hit-flint/22193291A with the Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department fhttp://www,dwsd. ora/I . saying that water costs were too high. They opted instead to pull from the Karegnondi Water Authority, 
which is building a system to supply Genesee County with water pulled from Lake Huron. In the long run, this will mean lower water costs, officials have 
said. 

But until the new system comes online in 2016, Flint is temporarily pulling water from the Flint River. Since it made the switch, residents have complained 
that the water smells, is discolored and makes them sick. 

Soon after the switch, tests indicated the presence of coliform bacteria, which can suggest the presence of other disease-carrying pathogens. The water 
was then treated with disinfectants, and city officials maintain the water is safe. 

The question is not that whether there is a higher level of lead in water from the Flint River — it's that river water may be more corrosive as it travels 
through lead pipes on residential properties and in homes, said Brad Wurfel, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. About 
1 5,000 of the 40,000 Flint customers have lead pipes connecting to the city system, he said. 

But he said testing has shown that lead levels in the Flint water system — both before and after the switch in 2014 — have been under the acceptable 
limit of 15 parts per billion during every three-year testing cycle since 1992. Additionally, two rounds of supplemented tests since the system switch put

lead levels at 6 parts per billion and then at 11 parts per billion — a change that Wurfel said fits in tine with previous fluctuations. 

Congressman Dan Kildee, a Flint Democrat, called state and local testing ‘'lackluster." 

For one thing, Flint residents collect samples, and there are concerns that there are too few samples and that they represent only some parts of the 
city. And Wurfei confirmed that about 60 bottles of water samples were turned in by citizens in the last round of testing, even though 200 bottles were 
sent out. 

In the best of circumstances — with enough sampling and previous clean tests of water — citizen sampling might be adequate. But, in Flint — where 
there's a major change in the system that some residents say have led to heaith problems, "it seems to be a much higher standard would apply,” Kildee 
said. 

In addition to water testing, Wurfel a said state public health officials have reexamined results of blood-lead level testing among Flint children. In short, 
that data doesn’t show the same upward trend that Hanna-Attisha's found, he said. 

Wurfel said environmental officials aren't taking the matter lightly, and they realize the water system is in "dire" need of an overhaul. They've requested a 
meeting with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorities to "review protocols" to make sure the state's testing is adequate. 

"Lead is serious. Lead builds up. Lead effects children. It's not something we take lightly," he said. "WeTe confident with what we’ve done, but we know 
there are concerns." 

Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, any increase in the past year in blood-lead levels among 
Flint children is attributed to predicable seasonal spikes. 

In the year preceding the change in the water system, 95 Flint children younger than 16, or 2.4% of those tested, had elevated blood-lead levels, 
according to state data. The following year, 123 children, or 3.2%, of those tested had elevated blood-lead levels. 

There is "cause for concern in Flint," but it cannot be attributed to the water, she said.

Lead' s toll fhttos://www.nlm.nih.aov/medlineolus/ency/artide/002473,htrn1 on children: 

Lead can affect many parts of the body, and is most harmful when there is repeated exposure, even to small amounts. Even low levels of lead exposure 
can harm a child's mental development, and the problems worsen as blood-lead levels get higher. 

The younger the child, the more harmful the exposure; unborn children are the most vulnerable, according to the National Institutes of Health, 

Among possible complications: 

• Behavior or attention problems 

• Failure at school 

• Hearing problems 

• Kidney damage 

• Reduced IQ 

• Slowed body growth 

Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, a staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while 
switching waters 

SEPTEMBER 27. 5015 BY DAVID ERYAN IN HEALTH 0 COMMENT f V g* © in

Catastrophic floods threaten the 
entire East Coast of America 
july29 2015 




t's exhausting to know the resounding yawn that appears to 
have emanated .from the governor's workplace, following 
information that an growing share of Flint children have been 
lead poisoned after a change within the metropolis's water 
provide. 


A spokeswoman for the Michigan Division of Well being and 
Human Providers despatched a Free Press knowledge analyst 
a chart she claimed would refute a report issued by a Hurley 
Medical Heart researcher, who discovered that because the 
metropolis began pumping water from the Flint River final 
April, the share of Flint youngsters with elevated blood-lead 
ranges has greater than doubled in some ZIP codes. 


In reality, the state's information helps the Hurley researcher's 
declare — the variety of children with lead poisoning had been 
falling in Flint and throughout the state, till the water change. 
Now it is rising. 


A spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder wrote in an e-mail that 
the Hurley knowledge had been “spliced and diced," a 
suggestion that it's one thing apart from correct — though the 
state’s personal knowledge bolsters the Hurley report. 

And officers 
throughout the 
administration 
have hastened 
to insist that 
Flint's water is 

protected and to recommend that though printed reviews say 
Michigan Division of Environmental High quality information 
present elevated lead ranges in Flint's water, there's no motive 
to suspect that has prompted extra Flint children to undergo 
from lead poisoning. And thus far, none of it has it spurred 
them to motion. 


However here is the scenario: There's extra lead in Flint's 
water than there was. And extra Flint youngsters have lead of their blood, one thing that results in severe, 
irreversible behavioral and developmental issues. 


The way it occurred 


The Metropolis of Flint determined in 2013 to affix the brand new Karegnondi Water Authority, together with 
Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties, That system will not be full till 2016. Within the interim, the town 
— below former emergency supervisor Darnell Earley — opted to pump its water from the Flint River, as a 
substitute of constant to buy it from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Division — partly, state officers say, as a 
result of DWSD deliberate to lift its charges for a brief-time period contract. Town thought-about mixing Lake 
Huron and Flint River water, however finally selected to tug waterfront the Flint River alone. Genesee County, 
in distinction, wiii proceed to buy its water from DWSD whereas the brand new system is below building.

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while switching waters | Statesman Tribune 

Researchers say ihat Flint River water, extra corrosive than the Lake Huron water pumped by the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Division, is leaching lead from the town’s ageing infrastructure into the water provide. 

The town, and its residents, need assistance. Within the close to time period, residents —particularly 
residents with formulation-fed infants, whose diets are composed virtually fully of water — residing in 
poverty want help to buy bottled water or filtration programs. And town wants to think about its lengthy-time 
period choices, particularly, whether or not to reconnect to DWSD till the Karegnondi system is full. 

That would not be a easy course of. Former Flint EM Darnell Earley, now EM for Detroit Public 
Colleges, wrote in an e-mailed assertion that he was not concerned within the determination to make use of 
river water, though it occurred throughout his tenure. He was additionally EM when a 9-mi!e part of pipe was 
bought to Genesee County, a call he wrote was within the works earlier than his appointment, which means 
the town cannot reconnect to the Detroit system with out the cooperation of Genesee County. 

Neither is the upper value of shopping for water from DWSD — about $1.5 million a month — within the 
metropolis’s price range, Flint Mayor Dayne Waiting mentioned. The town, which emerged from state 
oversight this yr, would want the approval of its transitional advisory board to extend its water price range. 

Flint, by the way in which, is broke. 

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee and state Senate Majority Chief Jim Ananich, each Flint Democrats, have pledged to 
deliver monetary and sensible help to the district. 

For now, Walling mentioned, Flint’s water therapy plant will start so as to add anticorrosive brokers to the Flint 
River water, which can take weeks to affect the water provide. 

If I lived in Flint, I might be mad. If I had been a Flint mum or dad, with a little one who'd spent the final 12 
months and a half ingesting lead-contaminated water, I might be in despair. 

We’re speaking a few public well being disaster — one that would have been prevented. 

Whose fault is it? 

Throughout their tenures, emergency managers are the last word authority within the cities they serve. 

And so toe accountability for Flint's water ties, finally, with Snyder, and the emergency managers he 
appointed — and it's Snyder who should come to Flint's rescue. Walling says Flint’s residents want funds for 
instant aid, however that the town wants grants to begin to improve its growing older, lead-ridden water 
infrastructure. 

Snyder hasn’t hesitated to nominate or retain emergency managers in struggling cities throughout the state, a 
stance the Free Press Editorial Board has largely supported, with one caveat: Emergency managers need to 
make issues higher. 

That's the premise on which the emergency supervisor legislation is based. Cities are the creation of toe 
state. The state has a accountability to took after the well being and welfare of its residents, and typically, 
cities face challenges not fixable on the native degree. !n these instances, the state should step in. 

That is actually the case in Ftint, which has suffered from the identical lack of inhabitants — and tax base 
— as Detroit however with fewer property with which to leverage a passable consequence. 

In these circumstances, the Free Press editorial board has argued, the state has a accountability to behave, 
to revive some fiscal stability, and thus service supply and high quality of life for residents. 

That is the catch. 

it would be straightforward to stability any metropolis's finances: Lay off all of the cops, promote all of the 
ambulances, liquidate town parks. However that would not make life higher for residents. That is the 
steadiness emergency managers should be conscious of — value financial savings versus high quality of life. 

Spending cuts versus service supply. A metropolis's backside line cannot be revenue-pushed. 

That is the evident weak spot within the emergency supervisor legislation, and it on full show in Flint. 

Snyder spokeswoman Sara Wurfel stated the state signed off on the swap on the behest of Walling and fhe 
Flint Metropolis Council, and solely “with severe reservations." 

That is not precisely how Walling remembers it. 

“I didn't assist it come what may," he mentioned. "It wasn't my resolution. I had tots of issues about it that i 
raised internally, however the funds was in place ... i had loads of considerations about it, however when it 
was determined that was the choice ... t didn’t protest."

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while switching waters j Statesman Tribune 

When the Flint Metropolis Council voted this 12 months to reconnect to the Detroit water system, then- 
emergency supervisor Jerry Ambrose known as its resolution “in comp re hen si ble”: "Water from Detroit isn’t 
any safer than water from Flint,'' Ambrose stated, as reported within the Flint Journal. 

It is fairly clear that is not true. It isn’t dear what anybody from the State of Michigan is ready to do about it. 

Sixteen months in the past, Earley and Walling celebrated the town's departure from DWSD, elevating 
glasses of Flint River water, ready to toss them again, with a toast that strikes a hole word at present: Here is 
to Flint.

The Capitol Record Since 1906 


Volume #54, Report #195, Article #1 -Thursday, October 1, 2015 

Senate Activity Report j House Activity Report 


Pressure M< 


A coalition of Flint and state organizations asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to 
order a switchover of the Flint water system with the Detroit Water and Sewerage system, in what is one of 
the most striking actions in the controversy. The demand came as state officials plan to announce a series of 
actions on Flint on Friday dealing with the water problems in the city. 


One legislator - who also complained he had been denied documents from the state dealing with the switch 
from the Detroit system to using water from the Flint River (a state official said the wrong documents had 
been requested) - said there had been a general discussion, but no specifics about what Mr. Snyder might 
announce. Rep. Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) said he expected the state would provide more filters to residents to 
help curb lead in the water. Filters will be helpful, Mr. Phelps said, but not enough. 


Governor Rick Snyder will not be at the event, to be held at Kettering University, but Flint Mayor Dayne 
Walling, along with Environmental Quality Director Dan Wvant . Health and Human Services Director Nick 
Lvon . Urban Initiatives Director Harvey Hollins and the state's chief medical officer, Eden Wells, will speak on 
the initiatives being pursued. 

The presentation will be at 1:30 p.m.at the university's innovation Center, 1300 Bluff Street, 

The controversy over the water in Flint has grown exponentially since indications that lead levels, caused 
mainly by antique pipes and their connections, were elevated in children who were tested. Researchers said 
they could not absolutely say the elevated levels were from the water, but the measures showed the increase 
since the city made the switch. Also on Thursday, it was announced that the city had received donations to 
provide some 5,000 water filters to help contain the lead. 

Prior to the discovery about elevated lead levels, the controversy over the system dealt largely with the smell 
and taste of the water. Flint switched from using Detroit water to drawing water from the Flint River in 2014 as 
the city prepared to build its own system that would draw water from Lake Huron. The switch was made 
largely because Flint and Detroit could not agree on a short-term contract to use the water, and the city, under 
a state-appointed emergency manager because of financial problems, did not want to pay the cost of Detroit 
water. 


In a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Snyder acknowledged that in making the switch, not all factors 
were probably considered. 

The request for the EPA to order both the city and state to make the switch to Detroit water came with a 
variety of city and state groups, including the Concerned Pastors for Social Action, the Flint Water Study 


http://www.gongwer.com/programming/printerFriencHyTempSate.cfm 


1/3 



10/9/2015 Gongwer News Service 

Team, the Michigan Nurses Association, the NAACP-Michigan State Conference, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and the Michigan branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, getting involved. 

The request charged that neither the state nor Flint were doing enough to fix the problem and urged that both 
be ordered to immediately have Flint's water system reconnected with the Detroit system, and that city 
residents be provided with a free source of water that meets EPA standards. 

Mr. Phelps, meanwhile, complained that the Department of Environmental Quality denied and the Department 
of Treasury ignored a Freedom of Information Act request for documents related to the city's switch from 
Detroit water to river water. Anytime there is a change in water systems of the course of water, the community 
has to apply to the state for that authority. 

But Brad Wurfel, with the DEQ, said Flint did not have to file that application because the city had always 
listed the Flint River as its back-up should it need it for a water supply. 

However, there are other documents that are available - to Mr. Phelps or anyone - dealing with the process the 
city and state took preparing for the switch, Mr. Wurfel said. 

Mr. Phelps said a DEQ official contacted him and said there were documents available and that they would be 
sent to him. The official asked that he drop his FOIA request, Mr. Phelps said. 

On the advice of his lawyers, Mr. Phelps said he did not drop the request. But he had also asked the 
department for any documents that might have to do with the switch. After his request was denied, he 
received several documents dealing with the system, but the documents were from 2007 and did not have to 
do with the switch. 

Mr. Phelps was surprised by the refusal and was planning what steps to next take. 

In terms of what the state should do to help in the situation, Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) 
told reporters after session on Thursday that he thought the state should first help with distributing filters to 
residents, especially those who may be most vulnerable, listing pregnant women, children, women that are 
nursing, those with immune system issues and the elderly among them. 

"That should be done immediately," Mr. Ananich said. "I think we need to have corrosion control put in place 
as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, I think we need some independent, outside testers to come in and 
develop the confidence level that's just not there with traditional people in place. And I think we need to have a 
serious look at reconnecting with Detroit. I think the state needs to help us find a new source of water." 

He said he would reserve judgment about how well the state has responded to the situation until after the 
administration makes its recommendations and remains unsure about any estimates on how much it might 
cost for Flint to reconnect to Detroit water. 

"There's been some negotiations going on at the local level, but I think it's important to get the real cost 
because it's a public health issue. And I'm hopeful we'll find that. I would hope that all folks, with an issue of 
this magnitude, would not try to gouge a community that's been suffering the way they are," Mr. Ananich said. 
"I think we need to all, at the state level, make sure people are negotiating in good faith." 

And Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof (R-West Olive) said he is unsure what the state's role should be 
in terms of helping Flint. The Senate did, on Thursday, include a $100 placeholder to deal with Flint's water

crisis in an appropriations supplemental it passed, but that was to keep the conversation going, Mr. Ananich 
said (see separate story). 

"I don't know that we really have a solution there yet," Mr. Meekhof said after session. "We could use 
revolving funds maybe. I don't think the city of Flint is in as bad of financial trouble as the city of Detroit, so if 
they need to bond for something, they would have assets with which to bond and maybe fix the problem. 
There's lots of options that are out there."

Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State of 
Michigan, City of Flint 

State , city failed to release documents sought in FOIA request 


i 



LANSING — State Representative Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) announced earlier today that 
he is filing suit against the state of Michigan and the city of Flint to force them to release 
public documents he requested last month under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

"It's an absolute shame that I have to file suit to force our government to comply with 
the law," Phelps said. "I was shocked at their response, because prior to receiving the denials, 
officials from both the city and state had told me that not only did documents exist, but they 
would be happy to share them with me." 

On Sept. 4 of this year, Phelps requested that the city and state turn over all documents 
and emails regarding the permit and application process that Flint's emergency manager was 
required to complete before the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality gave the go 
ahead to the city to start using the Flint River as its source of drinking water. Late last month, 
the state and the city both denied Phelps' request, saying that no such documents exist. 

In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also quoted in 
several articles on Mlive.com, making comments about the permit application process for Flint 
to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit's system to the Flint River. 

"I want to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality of the river water 
before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent actions, it almost seems 
they knew a lot more than they are letting on to," Phelps said. "Flint residents deserve better 
than this, they deserve to know the truth about the decisions that were made, and if I have to 
fight this in court to get the truth, so be it."

VERIFIED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT COMPLAINT 

There is no other pending or resolved civil 
action arising out of the transaction or 
occurrence alleged in the Complaint against 
Defendant. 


Keith D. Flynn 

Plaintiff Phil Phelps, (“Plaintiff”), by and through his attorneys, Miller Cohen, 


P.L.C., for his Freedom of Information Act Complaint, states as follows: 

Since Spring 2014, families in the City of Flint have been exposed to a significant threat to 
their health and well-being caused by the decision to switch the City’s water supply from Lake 
Huron water to Flint River water. This decision was made by the State’s appointed Emergency 
Manager in the name of saving money. In the process, the health and welfare of Flint residents has 
been carelessly jeopardized with thousands of residents being exposed to contaminants, including 
E.coli, disinfectant byproduct, and, most recently, lead.

This threat is the very reason why the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(DEQ) exists — to protect the public by insisting upon compliance with federal and state 
environmental regulations. The DEQ is supposed to work with suppliers of water, such as the City 
of Flint, and approve or reject applications for permits to alter existing water systems, including 
changes that are made to the source of water. MCL § 325. 1004(6). Part of this process requires 
localities to provide the DEQ with detailed technical information evaluating any impact that 
proposed alterations might have on the quality of water provided to the public. Id. 

State Representative Phil Phelps issued information requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the Michigan 
Department of Treasury, and the City of Flint. Representative Phelps wants to see if the State and 
City knew in advance about the potential hazards now faced by Flint residents. He wants to see 
what had been done to avoid this disaster. He requests documents concerning evaluations of the 
quality of water in the Flint River, documents specifically pertaining to the application and permit 
process, and other documents relating to the change in the City’s water source. 

In public statements, State and City officials have discussed documents addressing the 
change from Detroit to Flint River water as Flint’s primary source of water. However, in response 
to Representative Phelps’ FOIA requests, they now deny that such documents exist. The 
cleanliness of the water is a critical health and safety issue, which must be revealed to the public. 

I The Defendants cannot make public assurances of the existence of documents, only to refuse to 
turn those documents over. 

As a result, Representative Phelps is now forced to file this action, along with another action 
in the Michigan Court of Claims, seeking to disclose information that the public has the right to 
know. For those reasons, Plaintiff Phelps seeks an Order from this Court requiring the City to 
respond to Plaintiffs FOIA requests and seeking costs and attorney fees for having to file this action.

THE DECISION TO SWITCH FROM DWSD WATER TO FLINT RIVER WATER 

1 2 . Prior to switching from DW SD to Flint River water, the City of Flint, in conjunction 
with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of 
Treasury engaged in a process to evaluate the potential of using the Flint River as Flint’s primary 
source of water. {Exhibit A, 91-95) 

13. Gerald Ambrose, the financial advisor to the emergency manager for the City of 
Flint at the time, testified that: “There was brief evaluation of whether the City would be better off 
to simply use the Flint River as its primary source of water over the long term. That was 
determined not to be feasible.” (Id. at 91) 

14. Mr. Ambrose went on to testify that the determination that it was not feasible was 
made by “the emergency management team based on conversations with the MDEQ that indicated 
they would not be supportive of the use of the Flint River on a long-term basis as a primary source 
of water.” (Id.) 

15. Mr. Ambrose also testified in regards to an independent study that was conducted 
by the State Department of Treasury as to the feasibility of changing the source of water to the 

I 

| Flint River. (Id. at 93-94) 

16. Notwithstanding this evaluation, the City of Flint decided to move forward with 
changing the source of its drinking water to the Flint River until the KWA pipeline was finished. 

17. In order to do so, however, the City of Flint was required by the Safe Drinking 
Water Act to apply for a permit to change the source of water:

(6) Before commencing the construction of a waterworks system or an alteration, 
addition, or improvement to a system, a supplier of water shall submit the plans and 
specifications for the improvements to the department and secure from the department 
a permit for construction as provided by rule. Plans and specifications submitted to the 
department shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed under article 20 of the 
occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.2001 to 339.2014. A contractor, builder, 
or supplier of water shall not engage in or begin the construction of a waterworks 
system or an alteration, addition, or improvement to a waterworks system until a valid 
permit for the construction has been secured from the department. A contractor, builder, 
or supplier of water who permits or allows construction to proceed without a valid 
permit, or in a manner not in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by 
the department, violates this act. A supplier of water shall not issue a voucher or check 
or in any other way expend money or provide consideration for construction of a 
waterworks system unless a valid permit issued by the department is in effect. The 
department may issue a permit with conditions to correct minor design deficiencies. If 
eligible, a supplier may request an expedited review of an application for a permit under 
section 4a. 

MCL § 325.1004(6). 

18. The Safe Drinking Water Act provides that the DEQ administers the Act and 
promulgates administrative rules to enforce its requirements. One of those administrative rules 
defines “alteration” to include “modification of, or addition to, an existing waterworks system, or 
portion of the system, that affects ... the source . . . .” Admin. Rule 325.10102. 

19. On the DEQ’s website, the DEQ provides the application discussed above. 
{Exhibit B ) 

20. The application requires the submission of highly technical plans and analysis for 


the alteration of the Water System. (Id.) 


21. Failure of a “supplier of water” — which include municipalities — to apply and 
receive a permit prior to alteration of a Water System violates the Act punishable by a fine of not 
more than $5,000.00 for each day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or 
both. MCL § 325.1021. 

22. Prior to switching to the Flint River, it was reported that the City was in the process 
of applying for such a permit. {Exhibit C)

23. On March 28, 2014, it was reported that the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality halted the City’s attempt to move forward with the switch in water source 
without receiving the permit. (Id.) Steve Busch, the Lansing and Jackson district supervisor for 
the DEQ, noted that the DEQ had only received “preliminary design plans and preliminary 
specifications” that the agency had commented on. (Id.) 

24. Howard Croft, Flint’s Director of Public Works, denied the inadequacy of the plans 
provided noting that the City had provided “A fully engineered construction package, including 
all the work to be performed.” (Id.) He went on to note that, “The submittal package has been 
under review for more than 30 days. The city has had ongoing discussions with the DEQ regarding 
the process and we anticipate a favorable response soon.” (Id.) 

25. On April 5, 2014, Emergency Manager Earley stated that the final application for 
the permit was filed with the DEQ noting that “We expect to have the permit early next week.” 
{Exhibit D ) 

26. Sure enough, the very next week, the spokesman for the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ), Brad Wurfel, was reported on April 10, 2014 as saying that the 
DEQ issued “a series of construction permits” noting that “They are racing to get all this work 
done.” {Exhibit E) 

27. The switch to Flint River water took place on April 25, 2014. {Exhibit F)

28. Since switching to Flint River water, Flint residents have been placed in jeopardy 
being exposed to substantial threats to their health and safety due to contaminants found in their 
drinking water. 

29. On August 14, 2014, the water tested positive for fecal coliform bacteria, E.coli, 
leading the City to issue a boil water advisory. {Exhibit G ) 

30. The water once again tested positive on August 1 9, 201 4 with boil water advisories 
extending into late September 2014. {Exhibit H) 

31. On January 2, 2015, a new threat to public health and safety was identified. In an 
effort to eliminate the bacteria, the City increased the chlorine used in the System. Residents began 
complaining that the water was causing skin rashes and their hair falling out. {Exhibit I) 

32. Then, on January 2, 2015, the City of Flint officially announced that the level of 
trihalomethanes (TTHMs) — a byproduct of disinfectant — was higher than the allowable amount 
provided for in federal law forcing the City to provide notice to residents. {Exhibit J) 

33. Long term exposure to TTHMs can create liver, kidney, or central nervous system 
problems, and may increase the risk of cancer, especially amongst those who have severely 

compromised immune systems such as infants or the elderly. (Id.) 

I 

34. Over nine months later, the City was finally able to reduce TTHM levels to the 
federal limit. {Exhibit K) 

35. Most recently, in July 2015, Virginia Tech University researchers released the 
results of their own independent study of Flint’s water supply revealing incredibly high amounts 
of lead far exceeding the allowable limitations of lead content under federal law. {Exhibit L)

36. On September 2, 2015, the researchers at Virginia Tech released another study that 
compared the DWSD water to the Flint River water (. Exhibit L) That study concluded that the 
natural corrosive properties of Flint River water is leaching lead from the City’s aging 
infrastructure. {Exhibit L ) 

37. On September 24, 2015, the results of a subsequent study by Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha, program director for the pediatric residency at the Hurley Children’s Hospital at Hurley 
Medical Center in Flint were released finding an elevated level of lead in the blood samples of 
Flint children. {Exhibit M) Specifically, the study showed that the number of children in the City 
with elevated blood levels nearly doubled after the city started using the river. (Id.) 

38. According to Dr. Hanna- Attisha: “What we found in our data is concerning.” (Id.) 
Dr. Hanna- Attisha noted that “This is not something you mess around with.” (Id.) 

REPRESENTATIVE PHELPS SEEKS DOCUMENTS RELATING TO 
CHANGING THE CITY’S SOURCE OF WATER TO 

THE FLINT RIVER AND THE CITY AND STATE FAILED TO COMPLY 

39. In response to this health crisis, Representative Phelps requested the following 
records from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of 
Treasury, and the City of Flint pursuant to FOIA on September 4, 2015: 


1. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality], or its agents, has in its possession, 
including correspondence, related to any waivers, permits or applications to use the 
Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the City of Flint or any 
other municipality or municipal entity. 

2. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality], or its agents, has in its possession, 
including correspondence, related to any communications between the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality, or its agents, and/or the Michigan 
Department of Treasury, or its agents, regarding any waivers, permits or 
applications to use the Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for 
the City of Flint or any other municipality or municipal entity.

3:00pm and ending around 4:20pm. Representative Sheldon Neeley was also present during the 
meeting. 

41. Both Representative Phelps and Neeley asked several questions regarding the 
switch to Flint River water, the permits and applications surrounding the switch, potential hold 
ups/delays in the switch due to DEQ’s approval process, and correspondence between the City of 
Flint and the DEQ regarding all of the previous items. 

42. Howard Croft said that they did in fact have documents related to those topics and 
stated that it would be no problem to share them with both Representatives. 

43. On September 14, 2015, the City of Flint changed its story. In the City of Flint’s 
formal response to Representative Phelps’ FOIA requests dated September 14, 2015, the City has 
refused to provide those documents. {Exhibit O) 

44. Contradicting Mr, Croft’s earlier assertions as well as statements made to the press 

in 2014, the City of Flint asserted that no such documents exist: 

The records which you have requested do not exist under the name given by the 
requester or by another name reasonably known to this public body or are not retained 
by this public body in the performance of an official functions. This is a certification 
of their non-existence. No Records — -Requested documents do not exist. 



45. The DEQ responded on or about September 1 6 th by telephone indicating that it was 
DEQ policy to provide copies of documents to members of the State Legislature free of charge 
and noting that there were several documents that would be sent over to Representative Phelps’ 

| office via email, but only if he withdrew his FOIA request. 

46. Representative Phelps indicated that he had to contact his attorney to discuss 
whether he should withdraw the FOIA requests. Since that day, Representative has not received 
any verbal communication with the DEQ. 

47. On September 28, 2015, after Representative Phelps refused to withdraw his FOIA 
request, the DEQ changed its tone like the City of Flint. {Exhibit P) 

48. Brad Wurfel, the spokesman for the DEQ stated in an interview with Gongwer that 
“Flint did not have to file an application because the City has always listed the Flint River as its 
back-up should it need it for a water supply.” {Exhibit Q) 

49. Obviously, Mr. Wurfel’s most recent statement ignores the statements that he, and 
others, made to the media prior to the switch. They all maintained that Flint was required to file 
an application for a permit with the DEQ and did in fact file an application that was ultimately 
approved by the DEQ on or about April 10, 2014, 

50. Nonetheless, Mr. Wurfel indicated during that interview that “other documents . . . 
are available — to Mr. Phelps or anyone — dealing with the process the city and state took preparing 
for the switch.” (Id.) To date, Representative Phelps has not received these other documents. 

51. Similarly, the Michigan Department of Treasury denied Representative Phelps’ 
FOIA request on the same grounds as the City of Flint and the DEQ on September 29, 2015.

53. The public has a right to know the degree to which the State knew about or took 
any action to determine the potential hazards of making this switch, prior to the decision being 
implemented by the State-appointed Emergency Manager. It is for that reason that Representative 
Phil Phelps brings this suit to compel the City of Flint to provide the documents requested pursuant 
to FOIA. 

COUNT I 

VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 

54. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference each of the preceding paragraphs. 

55. Documents, such as correspondence and communications, relating to any waivers, 
pennits or applications to use the Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the 
City of Flint or any other municipality or municipal entity constitute public records subject to 
FOIA. 

56. Plaintiff reasonably described the documents that he was seeking. 

57. No exemption recognized under FOIA applies to Representative Phelps’ requests. 

58. The Defendant’s denial is wholly without merit as acknowledged by the 
Defendant’s own agents in the past. Defendant failed to perform a good faith effort to conduct a 
search for the requested records using methods reasonably expected to produce the requested 
information. 

59. Hence, Defendant violated the FOIA, and for the violation, the Defendant should 
face all fines, costs and fees as pursuant to the FOIA statute, as well as be ordered to immediately 
tender the information. 

60. Due to the Defendant’s refusal to respond to the FOIA requests, the Defendant now 
bears the burden to sustain the reason for its denial. MCL §15.240(4).

61. MCL § 15.240(5) provides that actions commenced pursuant to FOIA “shall be 
assigned for hearing and trial and for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in 


every way. 


WHEREFORE, and for the above-stated reasons, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable 
Court grant the following relief: 


a. Order an expedited hearing as required by MCL § 1 5.240(5); 


b. Order that the Defendant to immediately respond to the FOIA requests of 
Plaintiff as found in the Exhibit N letters;

c. Find that the Defendant made a final determination to deny the FOIA requests, 
and such determination was in violation of the FOIA and arbitrary and 
capricious. Thus, Order that the Defendant pay to Plaintiff reasonable 
attorney’s fees, costs and disbursements, and order punitive damages of $5.00; 

d. Award all other relief as this Court deems appropriate.

talking about, are you referring to the cost of the 
City's participation in the pipeline? 

Q Both . 

A I had no direct involvement in any discussions relating 
to the actual cost estimates for the construction of the 
pipeline. I was, however, involved in doing the analysis 
of the cost benefit to the City of participating in the 
Karegnondi Water Authority as compared to continuing to 
receive, to purchase water from the Detroit Water and 
Sevier System. 

Q Were any other options — did you look at any other 

options apart from those two or variations of those two? 

A There was brief evaluation of whether the City would be 
better off to simply use the Flint River as its primary 
source of water over the long term. That was determined 
not to be feasible. 

Q Who determined that it wasn't feasible? 

A It was a collective decision of the emergency management 
team based on conversations with the MDEQ that indicated 
they would not be supportive of the use of the Flint 
River on a long-term basis as a primary source of water. 

Q What was the reason that they gave? 

A You'll have to ask them. 

Q Okay. You don't recall? 

A I do not recall.

Q Now, am I correct in that is actually what is happening ; 

f 

now, for at least a short-term — j 

i 

A That's correct. . 

Q — the City of Flint is using its own facilities and 
supplying its own water through the Flint River? 

A That is correct. . 

Q When was the possibility of using that as a long-term 
solution abandoned? 

MR. WARREN: Do you mean the Flint River? 

MR. ALEC GIBBS: Yes. ■ 

THE WITNESS: Probably sometime in FY13. I j 

don't recall specifically. | 

MR. BADE: I'm just going to object to the form ■ 

of the question. Abandoned by whom? ' 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) By the collective body that was 

responsible for making the ultimate decision by the City : 

i 

of Flint, I assume. Sometime in fiscal year 2013? 

A Sometime between — I guess sometime probably during '13, 

I believe, or perhaps even midway through '12. 

Q Okay. ' 

A I don't recall the specific dates. 

Q But it was based on communications from the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality. 

MR. WARREN: Objection; asked and answered. 

You can answer.

River . j 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) Who are the City of Flint sources who 
communicated the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality’s position? 

MR. WARREN: Object to lack of foundation. You 

can answer.

administrator, our public works director.

A Howard Croft, Daugherty Johnson. • 

Q Are you aware of an independent study on the feasibility 
of alternative plans for water supply for the City of

Flint that was commissioned by the Department of ; 

Treasury? i 

MR. WARREN: I'm going to object to relevance. 

We're getting really far afield here. I'm not directing 
him not to answer, but hopefully this can be tied up very ; 
quickly and we can all move on. 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) I’m just asking if you're aware of 

the study. j 

A Tell me what the name of the study is. 

Q I have it here. Mark this as Exhibit 5.

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) Do you recognize this study? 

A I do not recall seeing this actual document, but I am 

aware of the study. 

Q Okay. Do you remember when this study was commissioned? 

A I don't know. Apparently it was completed in February of 

2013. 

Q The study makes reference to a number of meetings between 
the City of Flint and the Department of Treasury 
concerning the investigation into water supply options 
for the City of Flint. Did you participate in any of 
those meetings? 

A I did. 

Q What meetings do you recall participating in?

remember when. 

Q Do you remember if one of those meetings took place in 
December of 2012? 

A I do not recall the date. 

Q Do you remember who participated in these meetings? 

A I do not recall. I was in attendance with the emergency 
manager then Michael Brown, as I recall, or Ed Kurtz. I 
honestly do not recall the dates and the timing.

the study, it says although it appeared that this was

treatment plant to supply the City of Flint without being 
supplied from either DWSD or KWA was initially 
considered. The preliminary investigation evaluated the 1 
cost associated with the required improvements to the 
plant and the Flint River dam system. And that although 
it appeared that this was a viable option, Flint, in a 
meeting on December 20th, 2012 with the treasury, stated 
that the City did not want to pursue that option and it

is no longer being considered.

annual contributions will be over the term of years for 
the loan bond amounts? In other words, what are Flint's i

construction going to be on an annual basis?

FLINT, MI - Not so fast, state officials are telling Flint administrators charging toward an April 18 date to 
begin using the Flint River for all of the city’s water needs. 

The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality says it hasn't received the proper paperwork from the 
city. When the state does get it, a review of the application for state permission to use the river could take 
30 to 45 days. 

The city is switching over from buying treated water from Detroit to using the Flint River for drinking water 
temporarily. Once the Karegnondi Water Authority completes its pipeline from Lake Huron to Genesee 
County, Flint will switch to the KWA. 

"In regards to the actual application, we haven't received one," said Steve Busch, Lansing and Jackson 
district supervisor in the DEQ's office of drinking water and municipal assistance. "We've received 
preliminary design plans and preliminary specifications and we've commented on those. They may be 
waiting until they have all the comments worked out before they submit the application." 

Flint has bought treated Lake Huron water from Detroit, but that contract was terminated when Flint signed 
on to purchase 18 million gallons of raw water per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. The contract 
termination goes into effect April 17. 

The under-construction pipeline will bring raw Lake Huron water to Flint and Genesee County when it is 
complete by the end of 2016. 

People in the city will drink Flint River water until the pipeline is complete. The Detroit Water and Sewerage

Department said it would stop selling water to Flint and Genesee County on its current contract on April 
17, 2014. Genesee County is negotiating with Detroit for water until the KWA pipeline is flowing. 

Busch said state reviews generally take between 30 and 45 days, but would not comment on if Flint would 
be ready to transition to river water by the time Detroit terminates the contract with the city. 

"A fully engineered construction package, including all the work to be performed, has been submitted to the 
DEQ by the city of Flint in preparation for the transition to use of the Flint River as a temporary primary 
water source," said Howard Croft, Flint's director of public works, in a statement. "The submittal package 
has been under review for more than 30 days. The city has had ongoing discussions with the DEQ regarding 
the process and we anticipate a favorable response soon." 

If the state hasn't approved Flint's use of river water by April 18, Busch said, the city would just continue to 
buy water from Detroit on a non-contract price until Flint has state OK to begin using the river. 

"I don't think there is any scenario that we will just willy-nilly cut off service for Flint," said Bill Johnson, a 
consultant and spokesman for Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. "Negotiations are continuing." 

Croft said the DEQ has been reviewing the request and asking questions throughout, 

"When both sides come to an agreement and all issues have been addressed, then the permit is granted," 
Croft said in the statement. "Flint has been in ongoing communication with Genesee County and the DWSD 
to ensure that there is no interruption of water service to Flint customers. As the Mayor (Dayne Walling) said 
in his State of the City address ’beginning this spring, we will be using treated water from the Flint River as 
our temporary primary water source. 1 We are still on target to meet this goal.” 

Croft said there will be a series of public forums where residents can ask questions about the city's water 
transition, what that will mean for rates and others. He did not have specifics about when and where those 
meetings will take place.

Emergency manager says city could have permit to use Flint 
River water by next week

FLINT, MI — The city expects to have a state permit that will allow it to use the Flint River for drinking water 
by next week. 

Emergency manager Darnell Earley said today, April 4, that the final application for the permit has been filed 
with the state Department of Environmental Quality after months of working with the state to ensure smooth 
sailing for the application. 

"We expect to have the permit early next week," said Earley. "We are still on track to operate our treatment 
plant this spring." 

The emergency manager's comments come after a story in MLive-The Flint Journal last week indicated 
the DEQ had not received the proper paperwork from the city for permission to use the river. 

DEQ officials said in the story that the application process could take 30-45 days, but Earley challenged the 
idea that it will take that long and said city and state officials have been working closely in advance of 
submitting the final application. 


The city is attempting to switch from buying treated water from the city of Detroit to using the Flint River for 
drinking water temporarily by mid-April. 

Once the Karegnondi Water Authority completes its pipeline to Lake Huron, the city has committed to 
switching back to using water from Lake Huron and the KWA again 

Earley said he expects to transition from Detroit water to Flint River water by April 17, the date Detroit 
officials have set for terminating the existing arrangement between the two cities. 

"We don't think there will be a lag" between those dates, he said. 

Earley said he has a contingency plan if the switch to the Flint River isn't made by April 17. Detroit Water

Flint gets final permit approvals from state to use Flint River for

FLINT, MI — Bottoms up, Flint. 

The state of Michigan has issued the permits needed for the city to begin using the Flint River for drinking water, a 
major step toward ending water purchases from the city of Detroit as eariy as next week. 

''They've got a series of construction permits" that were issued Wednesday, April 10, said Brad Wurfel, a spokesman 
for the state Department of Environmental Quality. "They areracing to get all this work done." 

The permits have been on Flint's to-do list since the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it was terminating 
its contract to sell water here on April 17. 

That deadline was issued one year ago, and city and state water officials have been working and consulting on 
required upgrades at Flint's water treatment plant since. 

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz said today, April 10,that the city is still targeting April 17 as the day to shut off Lake 
Huron water — treated and pumped here by DWSD -- and to turn on the intakes into the river. 

Because work is still going on inside and outside the city's treatment plant, the exact time and date for the switch 
hasn't been set yet, Lorenz said. 

Earlier this week, Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley called the city's ability to cut out the cost of water 
purchases from Detroit a "monumental change" for the city. 

"The city of Flint will be able to control water costs," Earley said. "I'm kind of glad we're not a part of that discussion 
(about the future of the Detroit water system) anymore." 

A consultant hired by Earley is expected to recommend new water rates during a City Council committee meeting at 
5 p.m. today. The emergency manager has already saidrates will not be reduced because of upgrades that are 
needed in Flint’s water distribution system, 

Flint officials will need that infrastructure upgrade whether they use river or lake water. City officials have signed an 
agreement to use Lake Huron water supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority once the pipeline it is building is 
completed — something that's expected to happen in 2016.

FLINT, MI - Mayor Dayne Walling asked fora countdown from the group of about a dozen people huddled 
inside a small building on Friday, April 25. 

"Three, two, one," they counted, then Wailing pushed a small black button. 

Seconds later, a green light winked out, and that was it. 

Watch the video to see Flint effectively cut its water ties with Detroit when the mayor pushes the button. 

Flint will use the river until the Karegnondi Water Authority builds its pipeline to Genesee County. The $274 
million project is expected to be complete sometime in 2016. 

Friday's event at the Flint water treatment plant also featured Walling and other elected officials 
drinking Flint River water. 

"It tastes like. ..water," said Fourth Ward Councilman Joshua Freeman after drinking a cup. 

It should take about two days for the residual Detroit water to clear the city's water system before all Flint 
customers will be drinking treated river water. 

"Water is an absolute vital service that most everyone takes for granted," Walling said. "It's a historic 
moment for the city of Flint to return to its roots and use our own river as our drinking water supply."

Second positive coliform bacteria test means Flint's west side water boil notice still in effect Page 1 of 3 



Second positive coliform bacteria test means Flint's west side 
water boil notice still in effect

(This story has been updated to correct 
information about water test results in the 
boil water advisory area.) 

FLINT, MI — A second water sample in an 
area where residents have been told to 
boil their drinking water has tested 
positive for total coliform, meaning owners 
of businesses and residents there should 
continue to boil water until further notice - 
- at least until Wednesday, Aug. 19. 

"We don't know yet what caused this. We 
don't have a smoking pistol," said 
Mike Prysby, an engineer with the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. 

Update: Flint officials say 'abnormal' test to blame in E. coli scare 

Flint officials have ramped up testing in the boil-water area, a half-mile square area on the city's west side, 
since a positive test for fecal coliform bacteria on Thursday, Aug. 14. 

Fecal coliform bacteria — also known as E.coli — can make people sick, and are a particular concern for 
those with weakened immune systems. 

Prysby called fecal coliform bacteria in drinking water unusual, something that typically happens fewer than 
a half-dozen times in any given year statewide. Sometimes, doesn't happen anywhere in Michigan over a full 
calendar year, he said. 

The second positive test for total coliform came from samples taken Saturday, Aug. 16, according to Prysby. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says positive total coliform tests suggest there may be a pathway

for pathogens and/or fecal contamination to enter the drinking water distribution system. 

For drinking water, total coliforms are used to determine the adequacy of water treatment and the integrity 
of the distribution system, according to ERA. 


"The absence of total coiiforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecal pathogens are 
present," the agency Web site says. "Thus, total coliforms are used to determine the vulnerability of a 
system to fecal contamination," 


Fecal coliform and E. coli are bacteria that 
indicate water may be contaminated with 
human or animal feces. 


This is the area in which a boil water advisory is in effect on the west 
side of the city of Flint. 


Microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms, and may also 
pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely 
compromised immune systems, according to a news release from the city. 

Flint's boil advisory is in an area bordered by Mann Hall Avenue on the north and east, Whitney Avenue on 
the south, and the city limits on the west. 

The contamination is a concern for Sandi Blackmon, owner of Sandi's Elegant Catering on South Ballenger 
Highway, who said she's scrambling to keep up with her work with a boil advisory in effect. 

Not only does the advisory say water for drinking should be boiled, but also water for washing dishes — even 
brushing teeth. 

"I’m concerned, because I'm a former culinary arts student. I know about what food-born bacteria can do ... 
E.coli can be deadly," Blackmon said. 

Representatives of other restaurants in the busy commercial area of Balleneger and Corunna Road said they 
were boiling water Monday and will be until they receive an all-clear message from City Hail. 

"It's inconvenient but we do it — we do the best we can," said David Todorovsky, an owner of Atlas Coney 
Island. 


Flint Counciiwoman Vicki VanBuren, who represents the area, has another reason for concern about the boil 
water advisory. 

"My mother lives in that area," VanBuren said. "She has a lot of health concerns (so) I took her over some 
bottled water and told her not to use (tap water) to drink or cook with it.

"This would concern me no matter what part of the city it was in," she said. 

Council members could get more information on the water contamination and what may have caused it at 
committee meetings this week. 

In the meantime, Prysby said there are multiple possible explanations for the contamination, including water 
main breaks in the area, chlorine levels that are off-kilter or a poor sample location or collection technique. 

Prysby said water coming out of Flint's water treatment plant continues to meet all drinking water standards, 
meaning the problem is within the water distribution system. 

"We haven't confirmed a reason," he said of the results, "We're still investigating further. In some situations, 
we never find out why." 

The city is warning the people in the localized area to not drink the water without boiling it first for one 
minute, and letting it cool before using. 

Boiled or bottled water should be used for not just drinking, but for making ice, brushing teeth, washing 
dishes and preparing food.

Mike Prysby, district engineer for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, said water in the half- 
square-mile area tested positive for total coliform on Saturday, Aug. 16, and Sunday, Aug. 17. 

Flint officials have ramped up testing in the boil-water area since a positive test for fecal coliform 
bacteria on Thursday, Aug. 14. 


The boil-water area is Mann Hall Avenue on the north and east, Whitney Avenue on the south, and the city 
limits on the west. 


Fecal coliform bacteria — also known as E.coli -- can make people sick, and are a particular concern for 
those with weakened immune systems.

"The absence of total conforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecal pathogens are

system to fecal contamination." 

The city of Flintissued a statement Monday, Aug. 18, saying "testing over the last 48 hours has shown no 
signs of E. coii or fecal coliform bacteria in the water," but makes no mention of the total coliform test 
results. 


The city's statement says a sampling error is believed to be to blame for the initial abnormal test,

Page 2 of 2 


Prysby said the back-to-back positive total coliform tests are a "general indicator there could be 
more pathogenic organisms present" in water but is "not a direct indicator." 

"We haven't narrowed it down to any one possibility (but) we don't play Russian roulette with public health," 
Prysby said of the abnormal samples and the need to continue testing. 

Prysby said test results are "moving in the right direction" because there have been no additional discoveries 
of E. coli or fedcal coliform bacteria in water.

FLINT, MI — The city has issued a boil 
advisory for a portion of Flint, saying water 
in the area has tested positive for total 
coliform bacteria. 

The area of the advisory is bordered by 
Dayton Street on the north, DuPont Street 
on the east, the Flint River on the south, 
and by Lavelle Road to the Flint River on 
the west, the city said in a news released 
issued today. Sept. 5. 

The latest advisory marks the second 
time in less than 30 days that residents 
and businesses in a part of the city have 
been told to boii or use bottled water for 
drinking, bathing, making ice, brushing 
teeth, washing dishes, and preparing food. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Boiling water kills bacteria or other harmful organisms, according to the city's advisory. 

"Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Conforms are bacteria which are naturally 
present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially-harmful, bacteria may be 
present," the city's statement says. 

"Usually, coliforms are a sign that there couid be a problem with the treatment or distribution system 
(pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if other bacteria 
of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E. coli, are present. We did not find any of these bacteria in our 
subsequent testing," the statement says. 

The city says it will flush the system in the boil advisory area and increase chlorine added to water. 

All water testing results at the city's Water Treatment Plant have shown Flint's water, which is drawn from 
the Flint River, meets all Safe Water Drinking Standards when it leaves the facility. 

The city says anyone with questions about the advisory or any other water issues should call 810-787-6537.

important Information About Your Drinking Water 

Tests showed coiiform bacteria in the City of Flint water 

Our water system recently violated a drinking water standard. Although this incident was not an 
emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we did to correct the 
situation. 

We routinely monitor for drinking water contaminants. We took 150 samples to test for the presence of 
coiiform bacteria during September 2014. 15 of those samples (10%) showed the presence of coiiform 
bacteria. The standard is that no more than 5 percent of our samples may do so. 

What should ! do? 

You do not need to boil your water or take other corrective actions. However, if you have specific health 
concerns, consult your doctor. People with severely compromised immune systems, infants, and some 
elderly may be at increased risk. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their 
healthcare providers. General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available 
from EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-300-426-4791. 

What does this mean? 

This is not an emergency. A portion of the City was notified to boil their water at the time of the incident 
until it was resolved. Coiiform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. 

Conforms are bacteria which are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that 
other, potentially harmful, bacteria may be present. Conforms were found in more samples than were 
allowed and this was a warning of potential problems. 

Usually, coliforms are a sign that there could be a problem with the system’s treatment or distribution 
system (pipes). Whenever we detect coiiform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if 
other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coiiform or E. coii, are present. We did not find any of 
these bacteria in our subsequent testing, and further testing shows that this problem has been resolved. 

What happened? What was done? On September 5, 2014, after routine and repeat samples showed 
the presence of total coiiform, a boil water order was issued to the affected area. That area was flushed 
and resampled until samples were non-detect for total coiiform. The boil order was lifted on September 9,

FLINT- Some Flint residents are complaining that the city’s water is causing skin problems for some children. 

Hundreds of people turned out Tuesday to discuss Flint’s water quality' at a meeting with the mayor and city council members. Flint resident Qiana 
Dawson said her 4-year-old and 2-year-o!d have broken out in rashes because of the water, resulting in high doctor’s bills. 

“You all need to work with me on money,” she said. 

LeeAnne Walters said her 3-year-old, who has a compromised immune system, has been suffering from skin problems after bathing in the water. 
“We got bad water,” said City Councilman Eric Mays, who hosted the meeting. “If you buy a bad product, you return it for a refund.” 

The meeting was held hours after demonstrators gathered outside Flint City Hal! to protest water quality and rising bills. The Flint Journal reported . 
The city insists the water is safe.

Some Flint residents complain of skin problems from water 

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said officials needs to focus on how to improve the water. 

“I’m talking with people about water every single day,” Walling said, “We need to work together as a community, with the cooperation of the state and 
federal government, to fix this issue.” 

Issues with the city’s water supply emerged after Flint stopped buying water from Detroit’s water department. Flint officials this month said they were 
dealing with elevated levels of a disinfection byproduct. 

Flint switched from using Lake Huron as its drinking water source in April. The city plans to use the Flint River as its water source until the end of 
2016, when the Karegnondi Water Authority expects to complete construction of a new Lake Huron water pipeline. 

Some want Flint to switch back to using Detroit’s water. 

Walling has supported the decision by state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley to hire a consultant to correct the treatment of water from the 
Flint River. Gev#Rick Snyder on Tuesday announced that Earley would be put in charge of the struggling Detroit Public Schools district. 

Earley said last week that going back to Detroit water was cost prohibitive and that the city “can ill-afford to switch course.”

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DRINKING WATER 


City of Flint Did Not Meet Treatment Requirements 

Our water system was recently found to be in violation of a drinking water standard. Although this incident was not 
an emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we are doing to correct this 
situation. 

We routinely monitor for the presence of drinking water contaminants. Samples were collected for total 
trihalomethanes {TTHM) analysis from eight locations on a quarterly basis (May 21, August 21, and November 20 of 
2014). The average of the results at ANY of the eight locations must not exceed the maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) for TTHMs, otherwise our water system exceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). The standard for 
TTHMs is 80 ug/L. The location reporting the highest TTHM level was 99 ug/L; thus, our water system exceeds the 
TTHM MCL. 

What should I do? 

« There is nothing you need to do unless you have a severely compromised immune system, have an infant, 
or are elderly. In that case, you may be at increased risk and should seek advice about drinking water from 
your health care provider. 

• You do not need to boi! your water or take other corrective actions. If a situation arises where the water is 
no longer safe to drink, you will be notified within 24 hours. 

What does this mean? 

This is not an emergency. If it had been an emergency, you would have been notified within 24 hours. 

People who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the MCL over many years may experience problems 
with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer. 

What is being done? 

We are currently working on solutions to correct the problem. We anticipate resolving the problem in 2015. 

For more information, please contact Mr. Brent Wright or Mike Glasgow at 810-787-6537 or the Water Plant at 4500 
North Dort Highway, Flint, Ml 48505. 

Please share this information with all the other people who drink this water, especially those who may not have 
received this notice directly (for example/ people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses). You can

City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests 
revealed too much disinfection byproduct 

Ron Fonger | rfongerl@mlive.com By Ron Fonger | rfongerl@mlive.com 

on January 02, 2015 at 9:09 PM, updated January 17, 2015 at 10:04 AM 

FLINT, MI — The city says there's been too much disinfection byproduct in Flint's water system recently, 
something that — over many years could cause liver, kidney or central nervous system problems and an 
increased risk of cancer. 

The notice from the city says Flint water is safe to drink but warns those with "a severely compromised 
immune system, (who) have an infant or are elderly" that they "may be at increased risk and should seek 
advice about drinking water from your health care provider." 

For others, there is no need to boil water or take other actions, the notice says. 

"It 's been a rocky road," City Council President Josh Freeman said. "It's not acceptable. 

"People have a reasonable expectation that they are going to have quality drinking water. This is obviously 
going to rattle people." 

Mailed Friday, Jan. 2, the customer notices come after the state Department of Environmental Quality issued 
a notice of violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act for maximum contaminant levels for trihalomethanes — 
orTTHM — a group of four chemicals that are formed as a byproduct of disinfecting water. 

As city water plant operators used additional chlorine to fight bacteria in the Flint water system this summer, 
disinfectant byproduct levels also likely increased, city officials said Friday. 

Levels of TTHM have decreased since that time, and in Nov. 20, testing at eight locations showed only one 
that exceeded maximum contamination levels, according to the state's notice of violation. 

Testing on Aug. 21 showed contaminant levels were higher than maximum levels allowed at each of the 
same eight locations. 

"The water in our system today is not in violation" because of efforts to improve the distribution system and 
adjust water treatment, said Doughtery Johnson, utilities administrator at the Flint water treatment plant. 

Those changes "have likely contributed in part to the reduction in TTHM levels reported in the most recent

quarter, and suggest the city may be able to achieve compliance with the TTHM standard/' the state's 
violation notice says. 

City officials released a statement Friday saying its actions "appear to have corrected ... known compliance 
issues with the system, including a recent temporary increase in the maximum contamination level (MCL) of 
trihaiomethanes (TTHM) 

"Both the city of Flint and the MDEQ expect the corrective measures being implemented will resolve the 
issue by early 2015," the statement says. 

The city's recent violation for excessive disinfectant byproducts is the latest in a series of issues for the Flint 
water system since officials changed the water source pumped to homes and business from treated Lake 
Huron water purchased from the city of Detroit to water drawn directly from the Flint River and treated in 
Flint. 

The use of Flint River water is expected to be temporary because the city is a partner in the Karegnondi 
Water Authority, which is building a new water pipeline to Lake Huron. 

Once that system is put into service, something that's expected to happen by the end of 2016, Flint will be 
in a position to return to using lake water. 

Freeman said that long-term plan remains "the right path to be on" and said the city appears to be on 
course to fix the problem of disinfection byproduct levels, but Councilman Eric Mays called on the City 
Council to hold an inquiry about drinking water quality. 

"Sworn information given under oath is the only information I trust," Mays said. 

Residents have complained to the council about the smell and taste of the water since Flint stopped the flow 
of lake water here and there were three boil water advisories in a 22-day span this summer after positive 
tests for total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria. 

In October, General Motors announced that it would no longer use treated river water at its engine plant 
here because of fears high chloride levels would cause corrosion. 

Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft said that the city's aging water distribution system 
remains the biggest obstacle to meeting Safe Drinking Water standards but officials have also said the 
relatively low quality of untreated river water and the need to more carefully manage chemical treatment 
has also been a factor. 

Croft told a City Council committee in September that river water has proven hard to treat and to keep safe 
because of variables that wouldn't be factors in lake water, like temperature fluctuation and rain.

City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests revealed too much disinfection b... Page 3 of 3 

But Croft said the city has made improvements to its distribution system and said additional improvements 
are on the way, including pipe replacements, leak detection and hydraulic monitoring. 

Johnson said the size of Flint's water system, which once served more than 200,000 people and now serves 
about half that number, also makes keeping water fresh in distribution pipes difficult. 

Stagnant water is more susceptible to contamination, officials have said. 

Flint will remain in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act until every test site in the city has acceptable 
levels of disinfectant byproducts, Johnson and Croft said. 

The next round of testing is scheduled to take place in February.

Lower TTHM levels put Flint in compliance with Safe Drinking 
Water Act

FLINT, MI — The city is no longer in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act because the level of 
total trihalomethanes in water samples collected last month has fallen, the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality says. 

The DEQ notified the city of the test results in a letter Wednesday, Sept. 2, ending eight months of the city 
under a violation of the act. The city will no longer have to send water customers warning notices about 
TTHM levels. 

"Creative measures by the city have been successful in achieving compliance with this standard," reads the 
letter from Michael F. Prysby of the DEQ. "These measures have included replacement of anthracite filter 
media with granular activated carbon as well as the optimization of water treatment plant and distribution 
system processes and operations as recommended through operational evaluations conducted by the city. 

"It is important that the city continue to follow these recommendations in order to limit disinfection 
byproduct formation and maintain compliance (with state requirements)," the letter says. "While 
(requirements have) now been met at all eight compliance sampling sites, an individual TTHM concentration 
above (80 parts per billion) was measured at one location ... in August 2015." 

The location of the highest TTHM test in August was at Salem Housing, 3216 King Boulevard, which 
registered 90 ppb. Flint's violation of the federal law was the result of the annua! average of TTHM above 80 
ppb at a minimum of one of the eight testing locations. 

City officials have said they expected improved TTHM levels after the installation of the new $1.6 million 
carbon filter this summer. 

"The city of Flint is continuing to improve its water system, including both the areas of treatment and 
distribution," Mayor Dayne Walling said in a news release issued by the city Thursday, Aug. 3. 

TTHM is a colorless, odorless byproduct of chlorinating water with high levels of total organic carbon. The 
city began having problems managing TTHM after it began using the Flint River as its water source in April 
2014.

In past notices mailed to Flint water customers, the city has warned that drinking water with excess 
amounts of TTHM can pose increased health risks for those with a compromised immune system, the elderly, 
pregnant women and infants. 

The good news on TTHM comes the day after researchers at Virginia Tech published an online report, saying 
tests show Flint drinking water is "very corrosive" and is "causing lead contamination in homes." 

A statement from Walling on the lead issue says the city will work with the DEQ on a plan aimed at reducing 
the corrosive effects of water on older transmission pipes and home service lines.

Scary: Leaded Water and One Flint Family’s 
Toxic Nightmare

Curt Guyette is an investigative reporter for the ACLU of Michigan. His work, funded by a grant from the Ford 
Foundation, focuses on emergency management and open government. He writes regularly for Michigan 
Democracy Watch Blog, (http://www.aclumich.org/democracywatch/index.php/entry/hard-to-swallow-toxic-water-

It took a while for LeeAnne Waiters to realize the full impact of the 

Walters — a stay-at home mom with four sons and a husband in 
the Navy — had seen other numbers reflecting the quality of 
drinking water at her Flint home that were devastating. But 
13,200? She’d never seen anything like this. 

The city had tested her water twice in this past March and both 
times found dangerously high levels of lead — 104 parts per 
billion (ppb) and 397 ppb, respectively. 

Those numbers filled her with dread, because they meant her family had been exposed to high 
levels of a terribly toxic heavy metal that put her children’s future in jeopardy. 

But it was the result of a third test of the tap water in her home, performed by independent 
experts at Virginia Tech University, that most stunned Walters. 

"It took a while for me to wrap my head around it,” said Waiters. 

The VT researchers discovered lead levels in Walters’ water reached a jaw-dropping 13,200 
ppb — more than twice the amount at which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies 


number: 13,200.

water as hazardous waste. 

“When I saw those numbers I was shocked,” said Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, a 
former MacArthur Fellow and respected authority on corrosion in drinking-water systems, who 
oversaw the tests. 

Edwards played a key role in discovering and addressing the problem of corroded water pipes 
and lead in Washington, D.C. during the early 2000s, in what's described as the worst 
contamination crisis ever seen in a major urban water system. 

In terms of lead levels, the Walters family's numbers eclipsed even the worst D.C. homes. 

“I have never in my 25-year career seen such outrageously high levels going into another home 
in the United States,” said Edwards. “This was literally hazardous-waste levels.” 

But the condition of Walters’ tap water raises a much more far-reaching question: Since the city 
moved away from Detroit’s water system and began pumping water from the Flint River, how 
many other families have been put at risk by the city’s questionable testing procedures and 
handling of the water supply? 

The Walters family surely isn’t alone in dealing with the threat of lead-laced drinking water. Flint 
has tens of thousands of homes that are a half-century old or older, built at a time when water 
service lines were typically made of lead. 

And according to various experts, including an EPA water-quality specialist, the city’s actions are 
only exacerbating the threat. 

“What the public needs is accurate information,” explained Miguel Del Toral, regulations manager 
for the Ground Water and Drinking Water Branch of the EPA's Region 5. 

Instead, the city is utilizing testing measures that almost ensure that worst-case scenarios such 
as the one facing the Walters family escape detection, asserted Del Toral in an internal EPA 
memo provided to the ACLU of Michigan. 

Compounding the threat is what Del Toral describes as the continued inability of officials to 
adequately treat water coming into people's homes from the Flint River. 

“I don’t want to scare people unnecessarily," said Del Toral in a phone interview from his home in 
Chicago. “But there is absolutely a problem in Flint that needs to be addressed right away.” 

During his interview with the ACLU of Michigan, Del Toral said he was willing to go on the record 
with his concerns, but that he was doing so as a private citizen, not as a representative of the 
EPA. 

EPA rules, he said, required that such interviews be routed through the agency’s public affairs 
people. But he's willing to speak out nonetheless, he said, because of the potential harm to the 
public is so great, 

WATERING DOWN THE TESTS 

Perhaps the most vexing problem in all of this is the contamination caused by the city’s 
decades-old network of lead and iron pipes — a problem directly connected to the switch to river

water, and the city’s failure to adequately treat it. 

Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules, if 
lead reaches a level of 1 5 parts per billion in water, the source 
of the problem must be identified and corrected. 

In early March, after months of requests (and only after Walters 
had received a doctor’s note raising concerns about problems 
with the water), the city finally conducted a test. It found lead 
levels of 1 04 ppb the first time. A second test recorded a level 
of 397 ppb. 

Blood tests, taken after those water-sample numbers were reported, revealed that one of her 
children, a four year old, had lead poisoning. 

The news was devastating, said Walters, and the concern it creates for her child’s future is 
haunting. 

“Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body,” according to the EPA’s web site. 
“Children six years old and younger are most susceptible ... Even low levels of lead in the blood 
of children can result in: behavior and learning problems; lower IQ and hyperactivity; slowed 
growth; and hearing problems.” 

Those dangers made Walters all the more determined to get her questions answered. 

For one thing, she wanted to know why residents were being instructed to “pre-flush” water lines 
before drawing samples that would be tested by the city 

After much searching, she found Del Toral at the EPA’s Region 5 in Chicago. He explained to her 
that her instincts were right, and that she had good cause to be concerned about the way testing 
was being done. 

“The practice of pre-flushing before collecting compliance samples has been shown to result in 
the minimization of lead capture and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water,” 
wrote Del Toral in an internal memo dated June 24. 

Del Toral went on to say that the city’s testing methods were a “serious concern” because they 
“could provide a false sense of security to the residents of Flint regarding lead levels in the 
water.” As a result, he warned, residents could fail to take the necessary precautions to protect 
their families from lead in the drinking water. 

Virginia Tech’s Edwards completely agrees with Del Toral’s assessment. 

“The net effect of a ‘pre-flush’ is to greatly reduce the likelihood of detecting lead in samples 
collected ... that would normally be present in the consumers drinking water,” Edwards wrote in 
an email. “I have long maintained that the practice should be banned, as it artificially iowers the 
amount of lead detected in samples versus typical consumer exposure.” 

Asked about these concerns, city spokesman Jason Lorenz offered the following email reply: 
“While I cannot directly respond to Mr. Del Toral's remarks without first contacting the EPA

Region 5 office, I can say that the City of Flint follows all the testing procedures and schedules as 
required by the U.S. EPA.” 

He added that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) endorses the city’s 
sampling method. The MDEQ did not respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking its comments 
on the controversy. 

Del Toral contended in an interview that what Flint’s doing is actually exploiting a "loophole” in the 
law. 

“From a technical standpoint, there’s no justification for the way Flint is conducting its tests," Del 
Toral said. “Any credible scientist will tell you [the city’s] method is not the way to catch 
worst-case conditions." 

There is no legitimate reason for the city’s methodology, said Del Toral. 

During his interview with the ACLU of Michigan, Del Toral said he was willing to go on the record 
with his concerns, but that he was doing so as a private citizen, not as a representative of the 
EPA. 

EPA rules, he said, required that such interviews be routed through the agency’s public affairs 
people. But he was willing to speak out nonetheless, he said, because of the potential harm to 
the public. 

FLUSHING OUT REAL ANSWERS 

it was Del Toral who, after determining that the lead problem plaguing the Walters family was 
coming from outside their home, connected LeeAnne with Edwards at Virginia Tech. 

Instead of taking a single sample after a line had been “pre-flushed” under the city’s direction, 
Edwards instructed Walters to collect a series of samples from water that had been allowed to sit 
in the service line long enough to accurately reflect levels the family could be exposed to under 
normal use. 

(Meanwhile, that same service line, dug up and replaced after the sample collection, was found 
to be made of lead in one section and iron in another.) 

Edwards tested the water and discovered that the lead contamination ranged from 200 ppb to the 
13,200 ppb figure that stunned LeeAnne Walters — and should likewise shock many others. 

Given the age of much of Flint’s infrastructure, Edwards agrees with Del Toral’s assessment that 
the test results they found at the Walters home amount to an alarm going off, and others in the 
city need to pay attention. 

“1 do not see any reason why there would not be serious problems occurring in at least some 
other Flint homes,” said Edwards. 

In 1986, the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act was amended to prohibit the use of lead pipes in public 
water systems. Every house built before that is potentially at risk, said Edwards. About half of 
Flint’s roughly 40,000 homes are at least 50 years old. 

Making things worse is the fact that the high levels of chlorine being used to treat Flint’s dirty river

water lead to the creation of a carcinogenic byproduct know as total trihalomenhanes, or TTH7M. 
To keep TTHM levels down, the city is adding ferric chloride. The trouble is, that additive can also 
accelerate the corrosion of lead and iron pipes. 

Adding yet another layer to the problem is something the city is not doing. 

According to Del Toral, Flint should be adding corrosion-control chemicals designed to help keep 
lead and copper in pipes from leaching into drinking water. Doing so is required by federal 
regulations, wrote Del Toral in his memo. 

“To our knowledge, that is inaccurate,” said Flint spokesman Lorenz. “Before the plant was 
placed in operation, the City (and our engineering firm) had numerous discussions with DEQ 
personnel and inquired if corrosion-control chemicals - typically phosphates -needed to be 
included in the treatment process. The use of these chemicals was not required or mandated." 

What’s indisputable is this: 

Flint’s water contained corrosion-control chemicals until Aprii 2014, when Flint’s ties to the Detroit 
water system were severed. Flint officials hailed that changeover as a cost-cutting move for a city 
facing a financial crisis so severe it had been placed under the control of a state-appointed 
emergency manager. 

Discontinuing the use of the anti-corrosion chemicals allowed toxic scale built up on the insides 
of pipes over the past decades to be released into water flowing into people’s homes, explained 
Dei Toral. 

In his memo, Del Toral warned: “The lack of mitigating treatment is especially concerning as the 
high lead levels [that result] will likely not be reflected in the City of Flint’s compliance samples 
due to sampling procedures used...” 

In other words, at the same time the city is exacerbating the problem, it’s conducting tests that 
will probably fail to identity the true extent of the threat. 

Del Toral described the situation as a “major concern.” 

“in the absence of any corrosion control treatment, lead levels in drinking water can be expected 
to increase,” he warned in his memo. 

The EPA offered Fiint officials the use of agency experts to help get the situation under control, 
said Del Toral, but added that, to his knowledge, the city has so far declined all help. 

LeeAnne Waiters said that when she asked why city officials weren’t taking the EPA's offer of 
assistance, she was told, “We don’t need it.” 

Flint spokesman Lorenz, on the other hand, maintained that “the city continues to work closely 
with the MDEQ and the EPA Regional Office.” 

As for Walters’s family, that the city has finally replaced the service line leading to their home, 
and lead levels have dropped below the 15 ppb EPA action level. 

The problem now, she said, is that water currently coming out of her tap tinged yellow and smells 
of rotten eggs. City officials have given her no explanation as to the possible cause of that.

It is just one more in a long list of questions that need to be addressed. 

“What we need,” said Walters, “are more answers." 

But it’s not just answers the people of Flint require. 

They also need solutions. And, as Del Torai’s EPA memo emphasizes, they need them 
immediately.

FLINT, MI — Flint drinking water is "very 
corrosive" and "causing lead contamination 
in homes," researchers from Virginia Tech 
University reported online Wednesday, Sept. 2.

"On a scientific basis, Flint River water leaches more lead from plumbing than does Detroit water," the report 
concludes. "This is creating a public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead solder." 


The Virginia Tech report comes as students there, overseen by Professor Marc Edwards, are in the final days 
of testing water collected from 300 sample kits distributed to Flint residents. 

On Monday, Aug. 31, the researchers reported 42 percent of 120 initial samples from Fiint had lead levels 
that were more than 5 parts per billion, "which suggests a serious lead-in-water problem, according to our 
experience and criteria." 

Virginia Tech was initially contacted by a Flint resident who had concerns about lead in Flint water. It has 
been working with citizen groups in Flint such as Water You Fighting For. 

Twenty percent of the first samples also exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lead action limit 
of 15 ppb, the report said. 

The EPA requires water systems like Flint's to collect tap samples from sites that are more likely to have 
plumbing materials containing lead. 

If more than 10 percent of samples exceed 15 ppb, then water systems are required to take action, 
including steps to optimize corrosion control treatment. 


Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many years in products found in and around homes, according to 
EPA. 


"Even at low levels, lead may cause a range of health effects, including behavioral problems and learning 
disabilities," EPA's website says. "Children 6 years old and under are most at risk because this is when the

brain is developing. " 

The Virginia Tech report on Flint River water comes two days after representatives of three organizations 
delivered more than 26,000 online petition signatures to Mayor Dayne Walling, demanding the city end 

its use of the Flint River and reconnect the city to the Detroit water system. 

The petition language says high lead levels are one reason the city should no longer use the river as a 
drinking water source. 

Walling and Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft issued statements in response to questions 
about lead in Flint water Wednesday after Croft declined to discuss the issue in a news conference Tuesday. 

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz said the two would not comment further Wednesday. 

"The city of Flint is currently in compliance with the safety mandates of the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality and continues to work with them to stay in compliance with all safety and quality 
standards," Croft's statement said. "We have also been in constant contact with Virginia Tech, sharing 
information as it becomes available." 

Walling, who has supported Flint's continued use of the Flint River as a drinking water source, said, "Lead 
can be a concern in communities with older public and private infrastructure. 

"The city of Fiint has offered free and independent testing to residents since spring, and I encourage people 
to use this service if they have questions," Walling's statement said. 

Edwards, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, said the elevated lead levels he has seen in 
Fiint tap water are tied to a corrosive water source that contains about eight times more chloride than 
Detroit water does. 

"Chloride is generally considered to be very corrosive to iron. For instance, chloride present in road salts 
applied in the winter causes iron in cars and bridges to rust," the Virginia Tech team's website says. 

"This could be a huge public health problem. ... The Flint water just ate the pipe up," Edwards said of the 
testing he has overseen so far. 

In the testing, researchers took copper pipe pieces joined with lead solder inside them, according to the 
report, which says lead solder is probably present in plumbing systems of many Flint homes built before 
1986. 

Lead solder-copper pipe test pieces were placed in containers filled with water from Detroit and Flint in the 
experiment, according to the report.

"If it were me, I would not be using (Flint River water) for cooking or drinking unless I had it tested for 
lead," said Edwards, who previously mounted a six-year campaign that succeeded in forcing the U.S. 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to admit it had misled the public about the risk of lead in the 
Washington, D.C., area's drinking water, according to The Washington Post. 

"Bottled or filtered water (is what I would use for) children under 6 years old or if I was pregnant," he said. 

Brad Wurfel, communications director for the state Department of Environmental Quality, said the 
preliminary water testing results from Virginia Tech don't jibe with two separate rounds of testing during the 
past year by the city. 

That testing indicated "Flint drinking water meets state and federal safe drinking water standards," Wurfel 
said. 

Wurfel said lead levels detected in testing are not the result of water containing lead when it leaves Flint's 
treatment plant, But he said the state "has requested Flint optimize its water treatment to further limit 
exposure to lead from plumbing in homes." 

The concerns about lead are the latest challenge for the Flint water system since the city started using the 
Flint River to replace Lake Huron water sold by the city of Detroit in April 2014. 

Since the switch, the city has been plagued by issues such as water main breaks and boil water advisories 
because of bacteria and has been in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of high levels of total 
trihalomethanes (TTHM), a byproduct of chlorinating river water. 

The Rev. Allen Overton, who hand-delivered petitions to Walling on Monday, asking that city officials 
reconnect the Flint water system to Detroit, said Wednesday that the Virginia Tech experiment is more 
evidence Flint is not using the best quality of water available. 

"We have a major health issue here, (and) they are not being honest with the citizens of Flint," Overton 
said. 

City Council President Josh Freeman said the city has been willing to provide customers with free water 
testing and has taken action — such as installing a new $1.6 million filtration system — to address problems 
such as TTHM. 

Councilman Eric Mays said, as more water testing is done, it becomes clearer that Flint should be negotiating 
with Detroit for a new, short-term water contract as work continues on the Karegnondi Water Authority 
pipeline. 

The pipeline, a partnership between the city and Genesee County, is expected to bring untreated Lake Huron

disgrace."

We are now three weeks into our laboratory experiment w.r.t. testing the 
relative corrosivity- of Flint River water versus Detroit water 
(http://fiintwaterstudv.org/2015/09/flint-rivers-water-is-verv-corrosive-to- 
lead-and-causing-lead-contamination-in-homes/) . As the test continues, it 
becomes a more accurate measure of the relative corrosivity of the two 
waters. We previously noted, that it would be expected that Flint River water 
would be much more corrosive than Detroit water, due to its higher chloride 
content.

Experiment: When we visited Flint, we took pieces of copper pipe joined 
with lead solder (old solder is 50% lead by weight 

(http://www.copper.Org/environment/water/e p lead.html)) inside them. 

Lead solder is probably present in the plumbing of many Detroit/Flint homes 
built before 1986 when it was banned from use in drinking water systems 
(http://www.copper.org/environment/water/e__p_lead.html) . We put the 
lead solder-copper pipe test pieces in 250 mL containers, and filled them 
with the following three waters: 

Test l) Detroit water 

Test 2) Current Flint River water 

Test 3) Current Flint River water with orthophosphate (a typical corrosion 
inhibitor (http://www.lenntech.com/ products /chemicals/water-treatment- 
chemicals.htm#Corrosion%20inhibitors)) 

Test 3 was conducted, to see if adding orthophosphate to Flint River water 
would stop lead corrosion. About 50% of water companies in the U.S. add 
orthophosphate to their water to control lead corrosion, but it is not 
currently added to Flint River water. 

Results and Observations:

Figure 1 - Data from Week 3 comparing lead corrosion in Detroit water (left), current Flint water 
(middle), and Flint water with orthophosphate (right) 


From the data shown above in Figure 1, it is clear that Detroit water is much 
less corrosive to lead solder than the Flint River water. On average, Detroit 
water is 19 times (or 19X) less corrosive than the Flint River water 
currently in use. That is, the current Flint River water leaches 19X more 
lead to the water than Detroit water. This explains why the lead in Flint’s 
water in our survey, is so high, (http:/ /flintwaterstudy.org/information-for- 
flint-residents/results-for-citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/) even when it 
was low before when Detroit water was being used. 

We can actually still see the high lead in the Flint River water test by eye (Le- 
as white particles suspended in the water 

(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/09/flint-rivers-water-is-verv-corrosive-to-

with Flint River water, were slightly above hazardous waste levels (5000 
ppb), which is still lower than the worst levels of lead we detected in the

home of Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters 

(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/08/hazardous-waste-levels-of-lead-found- 
in-a-flint-households-water f ) . 

Orthophosphate still does not seem to help stop lead leaching in Flint 
River water, which is also consistent with expectations based on 
experiments in high chloride water 

(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010938X1100Q382) . 

There is a slight improvement, but even with phosphate, Flint River water 
has 16 times more lead compared to the same condition using Detroit water. 

We will continue to run these tests, but at present it does not seem like 
orthophosphate will provide a quick answer to the very high lead levels in 
Flint water. 

Conclusion: On a scientific basis, Flint River water leaches more lead 
from plumbing than does Detroit water as predicted before 
(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/08/why-is-it-possible-that-flint-river- 
water-cannot-be-treated-to-meet-federal-standards/) . This is creating a 
public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead 
solder. Unfortunately, adding orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor to 
the Flint River water, does not solve the lead problem. 


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS 


We believe, that in the weeks and months ahead, MDEQ and Flint will be 
forced to admit they failed to protect public health as required under the 
Federal Lead and Copper Rule. The question that will then be asked is “What 
can be done to protect residents?” 

Step 1: Issue Scientifically Sound Advice. 


http://flintwaterstudy.org/20 1 5 /09/test-update-flint-river- water- 1 9x-more-corrosive-than~d. . . 1 0/2/20 1 5 




Test Update: Flint River water 19X more corrosive than Detroit water for Lead Solder; N... Page 5 of 12 

The first step is to admit that the water in Flint is not safe for cooking or 
drinking (http://flintwaterstudv.org/information-for-flint- 
residents/results-for-citizen-testing-for-lead~300~kits/) — a fact that MDEQ 
still denies. According to MDEQ statements provided to reporter Ronald 
Fonger this week, which were presented to us for comment, MDEQ’s Brad 
Wurfel asserts that: 


“the issue here isn’t Flint’s water source or water plants. It’s the high 
number of older homes with lead pipes and lead service 
connections.,, .Folks who have concerns should get a water specialist to 
take a look at their home and see what they need to do to achieve 
peace of mind, because lead and copper are home plumbing problems 
that no water source can eliminate entirely.” 


We note that this is the exact same position that MDEQ and the city took 
months ago, after Lee-Anne Walters* child was lead poisoned from exposure 
to high lead in Flint water (http:/ / www.abcl2.com/home/headlines/Flint- 
mother-said-the-water-gave-her-son-Lead-poisoning-3 244965 5 1 .html) . After 
MDEQ and the City blamed Ms. Walters home plumbing for the problem, an 
EPA water specialist did come to her home and inspected her plumbing. His 
finding: There were no lead plumbing sources in her home 
(http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/file/EPAWaterReportQ62415.pdf) . 
How does that finding, provide Ms. Walters and other Flint residents, with 
“peace of mind?” 

Likewise, during our sampling events in Flint homes 
(http://flintwaterstudv.org/information-for-flint-residents/results-for- 
citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/) . we are finding very high lead in other 
homes with modern lead free plumbing, which again points to city owned 
lead pipes and corrosive water as the problem. 


http://flintwaterstudy.org/20 1 5/09/test-update-flint-river- water- 1 9x-raore-corrosive-than-d. .. 1 0/2/20 1 5 




Test Update: Flint River water 19X more corrosive than Detroit water for Lead Solder; N... Page 6 of 12 


On the basis of these facts, we consider MDEQ’s position to be both 
unscientific and irresponsible, and we stand by our 
recommendations to Flint consumers, that they immediately reduce 
their exposure to high lead in Flint’s water by implementing 
protective measures when using tap water for drinking or cooking. 


Step 2. Implement Corrosion Control. 

The second step will ultimately require some sort of corrosion control 
treatment to reduce lead in Flint water. Three options are possible as 
detailed below: 

1. Switch back to the non-corrosive Detroit water. It is our opinion, 
based on years of experience, that Flint’s lead levels would drop 
markedly in about one month. 

2. Add orthophosphate to Flint River water. As indicated in this work, 
orthophosphate will not reduce lead leaching from all lead plumbing 
sources. On the basis of our extensive experience, we would only expect 
modest improvements to water lead levels if orthophosphate was 
added. 

3. Wait for KWA pipeline. If orthophosphate was added to water from 
the KWA pipeline, it would be about the same corrosivity as Detroit 
water (Option A). In that case, Flint residents will have to live with the 
very high lead in their water, until at least one month after the pipeline 
is connected. 

Politicians and residents will ultimately have to look at which of the above 
options is best for Flint, after weighing feasibility and costs.

FLINT, MI -- City officials insist their 
own testing shows Flint water is 
safe and within federal guidelines 
for lead. 


Flint Journal file photo 


But those same tests also show lead levels have been rising since the city began using the Flint River 
for water 16 months ago. 

The results of Flint’s testing for lead since 1992, released by the state Department of Environmental 
Quality to The Flint Journal-MLive, show 10 percent of homes sampled in the city's most recent 
testing contained 11 parts per billion or more of lead, with six of 69 samples exceeding the federal 
lead limit of 15 ppb. 

Those are the highest lead levels measured in Flint by the city in more than 20 years, the state data 
shows. 


In contrast, the city's tests of Lake Huron water from Detroit for one 10-year period -- from June 
2001 until September 2011 -- resulted in just one of 155 samples registering higher than 15 ppb of 
lead. 


Flint began treating river water in April 2014 after Detroit terminated an expired contract for selling 
water to the city. The cutoff came after Flint joined Genesee County to form the Karegnondi Water 
Authority, which is building a new pipeline to Lake Huron, a project that's expected to be completed 
sometime next year. 

City and state officials have pointed to their own testing as evidence that Flint water is safe and 
under the 15 ppb limit, but have said little about the lead level drifting up. 

Marc Edwards, who is supervising separate water testing in Flint by Virginia Tech University, 
said there's no mistaking the pattern.

Lead levels in Flint water spiked after switch to river, state recor... http://blog.mlive.com/newsnow_impact/print.html?entry=/2015... 


"The Flint River -- based on the chemistry — has an obvious propensity for lead to be released to 
water," Edwards said. "There should have been red lights flashing (when the city began using the 
river in April 2014) — knowing that if you put that water into Flint's system without corrosion control, 
you're going to see a massive lead release." 

That release is what Edwards' testing has shown as 10 percent of homes sampled by students and 
faculty from Virginia Tech have had lead levels of at least 25 ppb. 

Since the testing started, Mayor Dayne Walling announced Flint would speed up development of a 
plan for reducing corrosiveness of city water and called for $10 million in state funds to begin 
replacing lead and lead solder in water service lines and plumbing. 

Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft would not attribute higher lead levels to the 
river alone, but said the source of the water is one variable as is the amount of time water is 
stagnant in pipes, 

"Lead is in there. It's always been there," Croft said. "We would like there to be no lead, (but) I'm 
happy how aggressively we are responding" to what the city has. 

Steve Busch, Lansing and Jackson district supervisor in the DEQ's office of drinking water and 
municipal assistance, said lead testing results vary in many areas and a shift doesn't necessarily 
show Flint River water is more susceptible to higher lead levels than lake water. 

"We see numbers fluctuate with the same treatment and the same water," Busch said. "We have 
levels go up and down from monitoring round to monitoring round." 

Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many year in products found in and around homes, according 
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Even at low levels, lead may cause health effects such 
as behavioral problems and learning disabilities. 

Current regulations for lead in water began in 1992 and require a limited amount of testing to 
measure the degree to which lead leaches into tap water after flowing through lead service lines and 
lead solder in home plumbing. 

If more than 10 percent of tap water samples from water systems exceed 15 ppb, the water system 
can be required to take steps like making water less corrosive or replacing lead service lines. 

Since the EPA announced its lead and copper rule in 1991, Flint has collected 33 samples every six to 
36 months but the number of tests increased after the city changed its water source to the river,

according to state data. 

State records show 100 samples were collected from Flint in the last six months of 2014, showing 
two sites with readings of more than 15 ppb of lead and 10 percent of homes registering at 6 ppb or 
more. 

From January until June this year, the city collected just 69 samples, a reduction that was allowed 
because Flint's population had dropped below 100,000, Busch said. 

The last time testing by the city showed a higher percentage of water samples above 11 parts per 
biilion was 1992, immediately after new lead and copper rules went into effect. 

In that case, the city of Detroit took five years to develop a plan to better control corrosion and lead 
levels and brought lead levels down from a high of 15 ppb in 10 percent of samples taken in Flint.

The water in Flint is likely poisoning kids. 

That’s what pediatricians in the city say, after looking at lead levels in young children before 
and after the city switched the source of its drinking water from the Detroit water system to 
the Flint River. 


Listen 

3:28 


There's a long list of complaints about Flint's water. But physicians are really concerned about this one.

“My research shows that lead levels have gone up. I cannot say it’s from the water, but that’s 
the thing that has happened," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician with Hurley 
Children’s Hospital. 

Hanna-Attisha says she decided to look into blood-lead levels after researchers from 
Virginia Tech found elevated lead levels in tap water due to the corrosive nature of the river 
water. 

She analyzed blood test results of 1,746 children age five and younger from Flint, and 1,670 
non-Flint children. Before the switch, 2.1% of Flint children had elevated blood lead levels. 
After the switch, that rate jumped to 4%. By comparison, the rate for non-Flint children 
went from .6% to 1%, which Hanna-Attisha says is statistically insignificant. 

She calls the city’s response to water quality problems “inadequate,” and says precautions 
need to be taken immediately. 


“Because the impact of not doing anything will haunt us for years to come,” says Hanna- 
Attisha, citing interventions like special education, lost productivity, and incarceration costs 
associated with high lead levels. “The cost will be astronomical in decades to come. So we 
cannot wait until this year or next year. We have to think five years from now, ten years 
from now." 

Hanna-Attisha and other physicians are urging the city to issue an advisory about how to 
minimize exposure to lead in the water. The county health department says it’s drafting that 
advisory now. 

The news about the elevated lead levels did not surprise Lee Anne Walters. She found out 
her son had alarmingly high lead levels in April of this year. 


“I kept talking to the doctors, trying to figure out why he wasn’t growing,” says Walters. "He 
was 27 pounds at four years old. His hair was thinning, breaking out in rashes." 

Walters says her son would get a rash when he took baths. There would be a line on his body 
that corresponded with where the bath water ended. Above it, his skin was fine. Below it, 
where his skin was underwater, he’d get a rash.

“The doctors in the city gave me a hard time testing my kids,” says Walters. “I took them out 
the city to a dermatologist down in Brighton, who ran the test and called me personally to 
tell me that he did have lead poisoning and anemia from the lead poisoning, and he's having 
speech problems.” 

It turns out the rash was probably from a chlorine byproduct the city had to dump into the 
river water to kill the E. coli that had made people sick the summer before. 

People knew that chemical - it’s called TTHM - was a problem. But lead wasn’t on many 
people’s radar until a guy named Marc Edwards came to town. 

Edwards is a researcher from Virginia Tech. 

His tests of Flint tap water found lead levels 
in some homes that were higher than federal 
regulators allow - and a lot higher than the 
city found in the tests it conducted. He says 
the river water is so corrosive it’s eating the 
lead from old pipes and solder. 

"That’s why we are actually asking for 

funding to help with infrastructure,” said Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson. "It’s 
not a secret that the city is very financially distressed." 

Henderson and other city officials say they’re working with state and federal regulators to 
get a handle on the problem. 

But they’re quick to point out that the city's own tests show it's in compliance with the Safe 
Drinking Water Act. 

But activists say they don't trust how the city arrived at that conclusion, and point to the 
Virginia Tech results as evidence that the city has been conducting flawed testing. 

"I want them to take responsibility,” says Lee Anne Walters, the mother whose son has 
experienced health problems since the switch. "I want them to quit poisoningtheir citizens.” 


”1 want them to take 
responsibility. ! want them 
to quit poisoning their 
citizens.”

michigan man • 

Let's be clear.. .this situation is at least partly a result of massive cuts in state revenue 
sharing, which led the city to take dramatic steps to cut its costs... and now people are 
paying the price. But hey, we cut taxes at the state level (and our per cap income is still 
in the bottom 15 in the nation). 


Allison MacArthur-Ruesink • 

This has nothing to do with Cost Cuts. The MDEQ is rife with corruption, 
perhaps the "employee" who had oversight of this facility was also 
hired and promoted based upon a family connection with a member of the Water 
Division's "Hot Tub Club" instead of experience and education!? I 
complained about the problems as far back as the early 2000's, even to Governor 
Grandholm's husband via Reading for Leading. Nothing was corrected !! Employees 
who speak out are harassed mercilessly and even worse as in my case. When I did 
not voluntarily retire after being asked 3x by MDEQ’s Jon E. Russell, he conspired 
and fabricated a case to get rid of me!! I took a polygraph from Forensic 
Polygraph Services (Mr. Neil Myers) to prove I was telling the truth 

but Michigan's corrupt Attorney General Bill Schuette and his equally corrupt 
Assistant AG Joseph Yung-Kung Ho (P-77390) have denied me any measure of 
Justice!! It is not a coincidence that the Judge involved with my case Thomas 
Wilson Jackson County Michigan used to work for the AG's Office. Everything was 
filed in a timely manner!! The MDEQ have even refused my receiving copies of my 
OWN PERSONNEL FILE! This is Michigan's way of saying "Thanks for 30 years 
of Service" They pulled this BS 65 days before my 55th birthday so they 
could deny my collecting my Retirement Benefits before age 60. Does someone 
have to die before the Bureaucracy cleans its own house?! Read "Well of 
Lies" about how inept and unqualified public servants who are unqualified 
or just plain corrupt, can injure innocent people!!

Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch

Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch 


6:44 pan. EDT September 25 r 2015 

with lead poisoning jumps after Flint water switch, says researcher. 

Flint's ongoing water woes are now associated with an immediate and irreversible danger — possible lead 
poisoning of some of the city's children, according to a review of blood lest results by a Hurley Children’s 
Hospital pediatrician. 

"I was hoping not to find anything, but what we found ... is concerning," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha who also 
leads the pediatric residency program at Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine, 

This is not something you mess around with,” she said. “Our population already has so many issues from 
poverty, from unemployment, from violence.” 

State officials say their own review of blood test results have not shown the same increase that Hanna-Attisha found. Moreover, water tests have similarly 
shown lead within federally accepted levels, they say. 

Hanna-Attisha examined results from blood samples of Genesee County children taken both before and after the city ended its water contract with the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department fhtto://www.dwsd.oroA and began pulling water from the Flint River. 

The number of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels — 5 micrograms per deciliter or more — jumped from 2.1% in the 20 months prior to Sept. 

15, 2013, to 4.0% between Jan. 1 and Sept. 15 this year. In certain ZIP Codes, the change was even more troubling, she said — jumping from 2.5% of 
the children tested to 6.3%. 

Blood is often drawn by pediatricians as part of routine lead-level testing, especially among children who are on Medicaid. That gave Hanna-Attisha 1,746 
test results from Flint children to compare against 1 ,640 results from elsewhere in Genesee County. Children in Genesee County outside of Flint showed 
{ no significant increase in blood-lead levels. 

Health officials have said no lead levels are safe fhttD://www.cdc.aov/nceh/leadA . Lead can lead to serious developmental problems, reducing a child's IQ 
and causing serious behavioral and emotional problems. Though levels can fall in individuals over time, the damage is permanent. 

If Hanna-Attisha's analysis is correct, this upward trend in Flint interrupts years of progress in reducing dangerous blood-lead levels. 

State data show that the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels have been falling for years. In fact in 2013, 3.6% of Flint children 
younger than 6 had elevated blood-lead levels, compared with the state-wide rate of 3.9%. 

Though Hanna-Attisha's review didn't try to determine cause, “we can't think of another reason' for the trend other than the change in Flint's water 
source. 

The review is sure to ratchet up tension in Flint. 

In 201 4, city officials ended the city's contract f/s1orv/news/local/michigan/2015/01/22/water-woes-l3test-hit-flint/22193291A with the Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department fhttp://www,dwsd. ora/I . saying that water costs were too high. They opted instead to pull from the Karegnondi Water Authority, 
which is building a system to supply Genesee County with water pulled from Lake Huron. In the long run, this will mean lower water costs, officials have 
said. 

But until the new system comes online in 2016, Flint is temporarily pulling water from the Flint River. Since it made the switch, residents have complained 
that the water smells, is discolored and makes them sick. 

Soon after the switch, tests indicated the presence of coliform bacteria, which can suggest the presence of other disease-carrying pathogens. The water 
was then treated with disinfectants, and city officials maintain the water is safe. 

The question is not that whether there is a higher level of lead in water from the Flint River — it's that river water may be more corrosive as it travels 
through lead pipes on residential properties and in homes, said Brad Wurfel, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. About 
1 5,000 of the 40,000 Flint customers have lead pipes connecting to the city system, he said. 

But he said testing has shown that lead levels in the Flint water system — both before and after the switch in 2014 — have been under the acceptable 
limit of 15 parts per billion during every three-year testing cycle since 1992. Additionally, two rounds of supplemented tests since the system switch put

lead levels at 6 parts per billion and then at 11 parts per billion — a change that Wurfel said fits in tine with previous fluctuations. 

Congressman Dan Kildee, a Flint Democrat, called state and local testing ‘'lackluster." 

For one thing, Flint residents collect samples, and there are concerns that there are too few samples and that they represent only some parts of the 
city. And Wurfei confirmed that about 60 bottles of water samples were turned in by citizens in the last round of testing, even though 200 bottles were 
sent out. 

In the best of circumstances — with enough sampling and previous clean tests of water — citizen sampling might be adequate. But, in Flint — where 
there's a major change in the system that some residents say have led to heaith problems, "it seems to be a much higher standard would apply,” Kildee 
said. 

In addition to water testing, Wurfel a said state public health officials have reexamined results of blood-lead level testing among Flint children. In short, 
that data doesn’t show the same upward trend that Hanna-Attisha's found, he said. 

Wurfel said environmental officials aren't taking the matter lightly, and they realize the water system is in "dire" need of an overhaul. They've requested a 
meeting with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorities to "review protocols" to make sure the state's testing is adequate. 

"Lead is serious. Lead builds up. Lead effects children. It's not something we take lightly," he said. "WeTe confident with what we’ve done, but we know 
there are concerns." 

Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, any increase in the past year in blood-lead levels among 
Flint children is attributed to predicable seasonal spikes. 

In the year preceding the change in the water system, 95 Flint children younger than 16, or 2.4% of those tested, had elevated blood-lead levels, 
according to state data. The following year, 123 children, or 3.2%, of those tested had elevated blood-lead levels. 

There is "cause for concern in Flint," but it cannot be attributed to the water, she said.

Lead' s toll fhttos://www.nlm.nih.aov/medlineolus/ency/artide/002473,htrn1 on children: 

Lead can affect many parts of the body, and is most harmful when there is repeated exposure, even to small amounts. Even low levels of lead exposure 
can harm a child's mental development, and the problems worsen as blood-lead levels get higher. 

The younger the child, the more harmful the exposure; unborn children are the most vulnerable, according to the National Institutes of Health, 

Among possible complications: 

• Behavior or attention problems 

• Failure at school 

• Hearing problems 

• Kidney damage 

• Reduced IQ 

• Slowed body growth 

Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, a staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.

April, the share of Flint youngsters with elevated blood-lead 
ranges has greater than doubled in some ZIP codes. 


In reality, the state's information helps the Hurley researcher's 
declare — the variety of children with lead poisoning had been 
falling in Flint and throughout the state, till the water change. 
Now it is rising. 


A spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder wrote in an e-mail that 
the Hurley knowledge had been “spliced and diced," a 
suggestion that it's one thing apart from correct — though the 
state’s personal knowledge bolsters the Hurley report. 

And officers 
throughout the 
administration 
have hastened 
to insist that 
Flint's water is 

protected and to recommend that though printed reviews say 
Michigan Division of Environmental High quality information 
present elevated lead ranges in Flint's water, there's no motive 
to suspect that has prompted extra Flint children to undergo 
from lead poisoning. And thus far, none of it has it spurred 
them to motion. 


However here is the scenario: There's extra lead in Flint's 
water than there was. And extra Flint youngsters have lead of their blood, one thing that results in severe, 
irreversible behavioral and developmental issues. 


The way it occurred 


The Metropolis of Flint determined in 2013 to affix the brand new Karegnondi Water Authority, together with 
Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties, That system will not be full till 2016. Within the interim, the town 
— below former emergency supervisor Darnell Earley — opted to pump its water from the Flint River, as a 
substitute of constant to buy it from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Division — partly, state officers say, as a 
result of DWSD deliberate to lift its charges for a brief-time period contract. Town thought-about mixing Lake 
Huron and Flint River water, however finally selected to tug waterfront the Flint River alone. Genesee County, 
in distinction, wiii proceed to buy its water from DWSD whereas the brand new system is below building.

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while switching waters | Statesman Tribune 

Researchers say ihat Flint River water, extra corrosive than the Lake Huron water pumped by the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Division, is leaching lead from the town’s ageing infrastructure into the water provide. 

The town, and its residents, need assistance. Within the close to time period, residents —particularly 
residents with formulation-fed infants, whose diets are composed virtually fully of water — residing in 
poverty want help to buy bottled water or filtration programs. And town wants to think about its lengthy-time 
period choices, particularly, whether or not to reconnect to DWSD till the Karegnondi system is full. 

That would not be a easy course of. Former Flint EM Darnell Earley, now EM for Detroit Public 
Colleges, wrote in an e-mailed assertion that he was not concerned within the determination to make use of 
river water, though it occurred throughout his tenure. He was additionally EM when a 9-mi!e part of pipe was 
bought to Genesee County, a call he wrote was within the works earlier than his appointment, which means 
the town cannot reconnect to the Detroit system with out the cooperation of Genesee County. 

Neither is the upper value of shopping for water from DWSD — about $1.5 million a month — within the 
metropolis’s price range, Flint Mayor Dayne Waiting mentioned. The town, which emerged from state 
oversight this yr, would want the approval of its transitional advisory board to extend its water price range. 

Flint, by the way in which, is broke. 

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee and state Senate Majority Chief Jim Ananich, each Flint Democrats, have pledged to 
deliver monetary and sensible help to the district. 

For now, Walling mentioned, Flint’s water therapy plant will start so as to add anticorrosive brokers to the Flint 
River water, which can take weeks to affect the water provide. 

If I lived in Flint, I might be mad. If I had been a Flint mum or dad, with a little one who'd spent the final 12 
months and a half ingesting lead-contaminated water, I might be in despair. 

We’re speaking a few public well being disaster — one that would have been prevented. 

Whose fault is it? 

Throughout their tenures, emergency managers are the last word authority within the cities they serve. 

And so toe accountability for Flint's water ties, finally, with Snyder, and the emergency managers he 
appointed — and it's Snyder who should come to Flint's rescue. Walling says Flint’s residents want funds for 
instant aid, however that the town wants grants to begin to improve its growing older, lead-ridden water 
infrastructure. 

Snyder hasn’t hesitated to nominate or retain emergency managers in struggling cities throughout the state, a 
stance the Free Press Editorial Board has largely supported, with one caveat: Emergency managers need to 
make issues higher. 

That's the premise on which the emergency supervisor legislation is based. Cities are the creation of toe 
state. The state has a accountability to took after the well being and welfare of its residents, and typically, 
cities face challenges not fixable on the native degree. !n these instances, the state should step in. 

That is actually the case in Ftint, which has suffered from the identical lack of inhabitants — and tax base 
— as Detroit however with fewer property with which to leverage a passable consequence. 

In these circumstances, the Free Press editorial board has argued, the state has a accountability to behave, 
to revive some fiscal stability, and thus service supply and high quality of life for residents. 

That is the catch. 

it would be straightforward to stability any metropolis's finances: Lay off all of the cops, promote all of the 
ambulances, liquidate town parks. However that would not make life higher for residents. That is the 
steadiness emergency managers should be conscious of — value financial savings versus high quality of life. 

Spending cuts versus service supply. A metropolis's backside line cannot be revenue-pushed. 

That is the evident weak spot within the emergency supervisor legislation, and it on full show in Flint. 

Snyder spokeswoman Sara Wurfel stated the state signed off on the swap on the behest of Walling and fhe 
Flint Metropolis Council, and solely “with severe reservations." 

That is not precisely how Walling remembers it. 

“I didn't assist it come what may," he mentioned. "It wasn't my resolution. I had tots of issues about it that i 
raised internally, however the funds was in place ... i had loads of considerations about it, however when it 
was determined that was the choice ... t didn’t protest."

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while switching waters j Statesman Tribune 

When the Flint Metropolis Council voted this 12 months to reconnect to the Detroit water system, then- 
emergency supervisor Jerry Ambrose known as its resolution “in comp re hen si ble”: "Water from Detroit isn’t 
any safer than water from Flint,'' Ambrose stated, as reported within the Flint Journal. 

It is fairly clear that is not true. It isn’t dear what anybody from the State of Michigan is ready to do about it. 

Sixteen months in the past, Earley and Walling celebrated the town's departure from DWSD, elevating 
glasses of Flint River water, ready to toss them again, with a toast that strikes a hole word at present: Here is 
to Flint.

The Capitol Record Since 1906 


Volume #54, Report #195, Article #1 -Thursday, October 1, 2015 

Senate Activity Report j House Activity Report 


Pressure M< 


A coalition of Flint and state organizations asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to 
order a switchover of the Flint water system with the Detroit Water and Sewerage system, in what is one of 
the most striking actions in the controversy. The demand came as state officials plan to announce a series of 
actions on Flint on Friday dealing with the water problems in the city. 


One legislator - who also complained he had been denied documents from the state dealing with the switch 
from the Detroit system to using water from the Flint River (a state official said the wrong documents had 
been requested) - said there had been a general discussion, but no specifics about what Mr. Snyder might 
announce. Rep. Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) said he expected the state would provide more filters to residents to 
help curb lead in the water. Filters will be helpful, Mr. Phelps said, but not enough. 


Governor Rick Snyder will not be at the event, to be held at Kettering University, but Flint Mayor Dayne 
Walling, along with Environmental Quality Director Dan Wvant . Health and Human Services Director Nick 
Lvon . Urban Initiatives Director Harvey Hollins and the state's chief medical officer, Eden Wells, will speak on 
the initiatives being pursued. 

The presentation will be at 1:30 p.m.at the university's innovation Center, 1300 Bluff Street, 

The controversy over the water in Flint has grown exponentially since indications that lead levels, caused 
mainly by antique pipes and their connections, were elevated in children who were tested. Researchers said 
they could not absolutely say the elevated levels were from the water, but the measures showed the increase 
since the city made the switch. Also on Thursday, it was announced that the city had received donations to 
provide some 5,000 water filters to help contain the lead. 

Prior to the discovery about elevated lead levels, the controversy over the system dealt largely with the smell 
and taste of the water. Flint switched from using Detroit water to drawing water from the Flint River in 2014 as 
the city prepared to build its own system that would draw water from Lake Huron. The switch was made 
largely because Flint and Detroit could not agree on a short-term contract to use the water, and the city, under 
a state-appointed emergency manager because of financial problems, did not want to pay the cost of Detroit 
water. 


In a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Snyder acknowledged that in making the switch, not all factors 
were probably considered. 

The request for the EPA to order both the city and state to make the switch to Detroit water came with a 
variety of city and state groups, including the Concerned Pastors for Social Action, the Flint Water Study

Team, the Michigan Nurses Association, the NAACP-Michigan State Conference, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and the Michigan branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, getting involved. 

The request charged that neither the state nor Flint were doing enough to fix the problem and urged that both 
be ordered to immediately have Flint's water system reconnected with the Detroit system, and that city 
residents be provided with a free source of water that meets EPA standards. 

Mr. Phelps, meanwhile, complained that the Department of Environmental Quality denied and the Department 
of Treasury ignored a Freedom of Information Act request for documents related to the city's switch from 
Detroit water to river water. Anytime there is a change in water systems of the course of water, the community 
has to apply to the state for that authority. 

But Brad Wurfel, with the DEQ, said Flint did not have to file that application because the city had always 
listed the Flint River as its back-up should it need it for a water supply. 

However, there are other documents that are available - to Mr. Phelps or anyone - dealing with the process the 
city and state took preparing for the switch, Mr. Wurfel said. 

Mr. Phelps said a DEQ official contacted him and said there were documents available and that they would be 
sent to him. The official asked that he drop his FOIA request, Mr. Phelps said. 

On the advice of his lawyers, Mr. Phelps said he did not drop the request. But he had also asked the 
department for any documents that might have to do with the switch. After his request was denied, he 
received several documents dealing with the system, but the documents were from 2007 and did not have to 
do with the switch. 

Mr. Phelps was surprised by the refusal and was planning what steps to next take. 

In terms of what the state should do to help in the situation, Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) 
told reporters after session on Thursday that he thought the state should first help with distributing filters to 
residents, especially those who may be most vulnerable, listing pregnant women, children, women that are 
nursing, those with immune system issues and the elderly among them. 

"That should be done immediately," Mr. Ananich said. "I think we need to have corrosion control put in place 
as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, I think we need some independent, outside testers to come in and 
develop the confidence level that's just not there with traditional people in place. And I think we need to have a 
serious look at reconnecting with Detroit. I think the state needs to help us find a new source of water." 

He said he would reserve judgment about how well the state has responded to the situation until after the 
administration makes its recommendations and remains unsure about any estimates on how much it might 
cost for Flint to reconnect to Detroit water. 

"There's been some negotiations going on at the local level, but I think it's important to get the real cost 
because it's a public health issue. And I'm hopeful we'll find that. I would hope that all folks, with an issue of 
this magnitude, would not try to gouge a community that's been suffering the way they are," Mr. Ananich said. 
"I think we need to all, at the state level, make sure people are negotiating in good faith." 

And Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof (R-West Olive) said he is unsure what the state's role should be 
in terms of helping Flint. The Senate did, on Thursday, include a $100 placeholder to deal with Flint's water

crisis in an appropriations supplemental it passed, but that was to keep the conversation going, Mr. Ananich 
said (see separate story). 

"I don't know that we really have a solution there yet," Mr. Meekhof said after session. "We could use 
revolving funds maybe. I don't think the city of Flint is in as bad of financial trouble as the city of Detroit, so if 
they need to bond for something, they would have assets with which to bond and maybe fix the problem. 
There's lots of options that are out there."

beyond state takeovers.pdf; ATT00001.htm; flint EM years.pdf; ATT00002.htm 


Importance: 


High 


Please see attached and below. We're starting to get numerous media inquiries on these. 

MSU, Sed by Professor Eric Scorsone with the bulk of work paid for by the Mott Foundation, has apparently released two 
new reports today both related to EM law. One on Flint and one in general. 


Haven't had a chance to read in depth yet, but one key take away as highlighted by Scorsone is this: 


Our research points to the fact that Mmrnmrn isOMfEMM i&: rbof bkl lilill te- come afiotzd fisrsi distress, not the only 
cause bat a major contributing factor. This is the first time we are aware of being able to quantify this conventional 
wisdom and place it in the fifty state context. And also that EMs often focus too much on just immediate fiscal crisis 
rather than public services, which is a major shortcoming of the Saw. 


Working on points now, but will likely center around lacking public services is one of the key reasons and our 
administration has made tackling that a priority and we never lose sight of that - exhibit A is Detroit and the rationale 
the Governor had outlined for action. That working to invest in local communities with targeted resources and 
programs is key and we have numerous examples of that. That we have had work groups help look at issue and identify 
root causes, ways to stem, early warning signs to prevent situations from rising to fiscal crises, etc. 


If anyone has any other immediate thoughts or feedback, please advise asap. 


Thanks, 

SW

Subject: New reports on Flint and local government issued by MSU 

Good Morning, 


Please find attached some new reports from MSU regarding the Flint EM years (201 1-2014) 
which is a follow-up to our 2011 report on Flint. 

Find here the original Flint report: 

https://w%vw.cityofflint.com/wp-content/u p loads/Re p orts/MSUE_FlintStudy20ii.pdf 


The second report documents the role of state government in the fiscal affairs of Local 
Government. In particular, you will note: 


Page 9, figure 4 that Michigan escalated its local tax limitations more than almost any 
state except Colorado 


3 



Page 1 1, figure 5, Michigan is a stick state in regards to local aid 

Page 14, figure 6, MI is ranked as being high cost and high revenue pressure (meaning 
revenue restrictions) which is the worst of both worlds 


Our research points to the fact that Michigan policies are a major part of the cause of local fiscal 
distress, not the only cause but a major contributing factor. This is the first time we are aware of 
being able to quantify this conventional wisdom and place it in the fifty state context. 

Thank you

Executive Summary 


One provocative pattern to emerge from the Great 
Recession is that instances of acute local fiscal distress 
have clustered in certain states and not others. As recently 
as last year in Michigan, a state appointed Emergency 
Manager was operating in each of 17 local governments 
and school districts. A recent California Policy Center 
report suggests that more than a dozen cities and counties 
in California - a state that has already experienced three 
recent, high-profile municipal bankruptcies and a near- 
bankruptcy in San Jose, the “capital of Silicon Valley” - are 
on the cusp of defaulting on general obligation bonds 

With the generous support of the C.S. Mott Foundation 
and Michigan State University, we have engaged in a 
multi-pronged, multi-method research program to assess 
the crucial but often overlooked role of state governments 
in shaping the ways in which cities respond to financial 
difficulties. This report, based on our analysis of a unique, 
nearly half-century-long dataset of state and local financial 
and policy information and correspondence with state 
officials, analysts and legal experts involved in state-local 
fiscal affairs, elaborates several key findings: 

• Municipal fiscal distress is not simply a local problem. 
State laws and policies provide state governments with 
extraordinary influence over the ability of cities to 
balance revenue and expenditure flows. The common 
perception that critical taxing and spending decisions 
are largely within a city government’s control tends to 
conceal this fundamental detail about American state- 
local fiscal relations. 

• The ways in which state lawmakers act on this 
influence varies from state to state and over time. We 
refer to the complex mix of laws and policies that 
prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions as 
the state context for local fiscal distress. Section 1 of 
this report assesses key elements of this state context 
for the lower 48 states since 1970. 

• Some states incubate local financial stress by 
simultaneously driving up spending pressures on 
their cities while curtailing their capacity to raise 
critical revenue. Since the 1970s, the proliferation of 
state-imposed tax revenue limitations, coupled with 
recurring cuts to state aid, has fostered a system that 
limits a city’s ability to fund critical services. Some 
state governments further undermine the fiscal capacity 


of their cities via state laws and policies that engender 
steep expenditure-side pressures (e.g., devolving 
program responsibilities or driving up labor costs). We 
classify these states as incubators of fiscal distress. 

• Michigan incubates financial stress among its local 
governments. Michigan’s particular mix of stringent 
limitations on local revenue and its relatively low level 
of financial assistance to cities, coupled with spending 
pressures stemming from spiking local service burdens 
and increased labor costs, creates conditions that drive 
up the potential for local fiscal distress. 

• Because state governments can foster dramatically 
different state contexts for local fiscal stress, there is no 
single model policy for state intervention in distressed 
cities or for prevention of local fiscal distress. A 
policy that does not address a state’s unique context 

is unlikely to help cities escape financial trouble over 
the long term. State lawmakers must decide which 
legal and political tradeoffs they are willing to make 
to support city fiscal health. Michigan lawmakers, 
for instance, must recognize that the state context 
contributes to the problem of local fiscal distress. An 
aggressive intervention policy does little to curtail the 
consequences of this state-imposed context. Section 
2 of this report draws policy lessons from comparable 
states in an effort to illustrate alternative approaches to 
state involvement in local fiscal affairs. 

This report’s practical recommendations are aimed at 
assisting the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
policy and legal approach to local fiscal crises. These are 
not overly startling recommendations, yet they are easy to 
neglect because policymakers tend to focus more on short- 
term political gain rather than the histories and unintended 
consequences of policies that, over time, become 
increasingly difficult to alter. Some key recommendations: 

• Creating a state agency that coordinates services to 
local governments and offers technical support and 
fiscal monitoring. 

• Raising awareness among citizens and state decision 
makers that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at 
the local level. Though state governments are certainly 
part of the solution, they can be a big part of the 
problem as well. 


Introduction 


A recent spate of research and media reports suggest that as 
the fiscal consequences of the Great Recession continue to 
subside, state and local fiscal conditions are on the upswing. 
American cities and locales, however, are not yet out of 
the woods. A recent analysis from the National League of 
Cities strikes the proper tone of caution when reporting 
that, though indeed state governments have recovered (albeit 
slowly), “...local fiscal health has not yet fully returned to pre- 
recession levels. ... While tax revenues continue to improve, 
increases in service costs, long-term infrastructure needs, 
employee wages, and pension and healthcare obligations, 
along with decreased levels of state and federal aid, continue 
to constrain the [local] fiscal oudook” (McFarland and 
Pagano, 2014, p. 1, emphasis added). 

One thought-provoking pattern to emerge from the aftermath 
of the Great Recession is that the fiscal outlook seems to 
be particularly bleak among local governments in certain 
states. The city of Detroit’s bankruptcy proceedings may 
have indicated that Michigan is something of a hotbed for 
local financial disaster. Yet a far more damning indicator 
is the prevalence of financial distress among the state’s 
other local governments. As recently as last year, 17 local 
governments and school districts were operating under the 
control of a state-appointed emergency financial manager. 
Recently, Michigan’s most populous county, Wayne, was 
recently designated for financial emergency status as well. 
Michigan does not stand alone. News from California, a 
state that has already seen four cities enter the municipal 
bankruptcy process since 2008, is equally discouraging. The 
authors of a recent report conducted for the California Policy 
Center argue that more than a dozen cities and counties in 
California are statistically far more likely than “a typical U.S. 
city or county” to enter bankruptcy proceedings or default 
on general obligation bonds, with several cities - such as 
Compton, King City, Sutter Creek and lone - are a whopping 
20 to 40 times more likely to experience acute financial crisis 
(Joffe and Larkedring, 2015). 

What is it with local governments in these states? When 
it comes to urban fiscal problems, there is much blame to 
go around. Some blame a mixture of national and global 
economic forces beyond the control of state and local 
policymakers. Others contend that the cities facing severe 
budget crises have only themselves to blame. The goal of 
this report is to refocus attention on the crucial but often 
overlooked role of state governments in determining the ways 
in which cities respond to financial difficulties. How and in 
what specific ways do state governments structure this local 
response? Is it possible to assess the fiscal value that all states 
- via their mix of policies, laws and institutions - may add to 
or take away from local fiscal decision making? Is it truly more 
challenging to gain and maintain fiscal sustainability in certain 


states than it is in others? And in light of this consideration 
of the role that state governments play in structuring local 
fiscal decision making, in what ways do state governments 
choose to - or choose not to - internalize their role in the 
design and administration of their fiscal distress intervention 
policy? In other words, can we identify policy self-awareness 
among state governments that place particularly onerous fiscal 
pressures on their local lawmakers? 

To respond to these important questions, we, with the generous 
support of the C.S. Mott Foundation and Michigan State 
University, set out on a multi-pronged, multi-method research 
program at a critical time in which a new era seems to be 
dawning for state-local fiscal relations. This report summarizes 
the findings of the first stage of this ongoing project. 

Section 1 of this report develops an indicator for the state 
context for local fiscal distress based on the mix of state 
laws and policies that directly influence the revenue and 
spending decisions of local governments. This section 
uncovers a number of compelling patterns in the state 
imposition of revenue and spending pressures over the 
past quarter-century. Chief among these patterns is that, 
although a number of states have taken measures to severely 
limit the revenue capacity of their local governments 
(thus reducing the resources available to maintain critical 
services) and several states have devolved greater service 
responsibilities (and higher spending burdens) to their local 
governments, only a small handful of states simultaneously 
drive up spending pressures while aggressively curtailing 
local governments’ capacity to raise revenue. Taken 
independently, state-imposed revenue- and expenditure-side 
pressures can play a determinative role in local fiscal decision 
making. Taken together, as in states such as Michigan and 
California, they incubate local fiscal distress and can serve to 
foster fundamental budgetary imbalances that more fiscally 
challenged local communities are ill-equipped to overcome. 

In Section 2, we draw on interpersonal communications 
with key personnel in several states to assess key elements 
of state policies for intervening in fiscally distressed 
local governments. We set out to identify similarities in 
intervention policies - of which Michigan’s is the poster 
child - and to learn how other states approach local fiscal 
crises differently. From our work with the state officials, we 
illustrate how state governments can more effectively align 
policy with the nature of the problems faced by cities in 
distress, as well as how state-imposed constraints hamper 
cities’ abilities to balance revenues and expenditures over the 
long-term. In Section 3, we combine the lessons from Sections 
1 and 2 to outline recommendations that can assist the C.S. 
Mott Foundation, state and local officials, and Michigan 
residents in identifying a more effective approach to local 
fiscal crises. 


Section 1: Assessing How States Set the 
Context for Local Fiscal Distress: Revenue 
Squeezes and Expenditure-side Pressures 


Two essential powers that local officials enjoy are their 
authority to raise revenues and their power to allocate 
those revenues as they see fit via public expenditures. In 
local media and policy research, city officials are sometimes 
lauded for what are perceived as exciting local policy 
outcomes, such as when a city makes a significant move 
up the “America’s Greenest Cities” or “Child Well-being 
and Health” rankings. More commonly, they are chastised 
for decisions deemed detrimental to the city’s future, 
such as providing generous benefits to the municipal 
workforce, slashing essential services, enacting a rigid 
historical preservation agenda or raising licensing fees. Yet 
the common perception that critical taxing and spending 
decisions - and, by extension, the apportionment of blame 
and credit associated with the outcomes of such decisions 
- are largely within a city government’s control conceals 
a fundamental detail about American state-local fiscal 
relations: state laws and policies provide state governments 
with extraordinary influence over nearly every aspect of city 
budgeting. From the type and level of financial assistance 
that state governments deliver to state-imposed controls 
over local revenues; to the growing practice and use of 
state mandates, preapproval and preemption; to minimum 
service standards; to the formal or informal consultations, 
advice or technical assistance that state governments may 
(or may not) provide, local governments in America, in the 
words of influential legal scholars Gerald Frug and David 
Barron (2008, p. 75), simply “do not have anything like the 
kind of local fiscal autonomy often attributed to them.” 

States influence local governments’ capacity to balance 
revenue and expenditure flows in a variety of ways. In 
this report, we focus on two core dimensions of this 
state context for local financial distress. 1 The first is the 
degree to which states participate in adding or reducing 
local revenue capacity via the policy balance between the 
buoyancy of state-granted aid and shared revenue, and the 
severity of state-imposed controls over city tax revenues. 
Although most states exhibit a relatively balanced policy 
approach to local revenue capacity, some state governments 
have responded to local revenue challenges by granting 
greater access to state intergovernmental aid while mostly 
suppressing financial controls over local taxes. These 
are revenue “carrot” states. Another group - revenue 

1 Formally defined as the complex, multidimensional, legal-policy 
frameworks that prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions. 


“stick” states, of which Michigan is a prime example - have 
responded to local revenue challenges by ratcheting financial 
controls while offering thin or uncertain compensatory 
aid. Simply put, we expect it to be far more challenging 
to maintain a sustainable fiscal outlook in states that 
simultaneously suppress own-source revenue capacity and 
transfer very little aid to municipalities, particularly during 
national or state economic downturns. 

State policies and actions also burden the opposite 
end of local budgetary processes: decisions over public 
expenditures. Few, if any, local spending responsibilities 
exist because cities choose to take them on. The state 
decides. 2 Spending pressures can be subtler. For instance, 
local labor costs, which account for a large slice of most 
cities’ budgets, are heavily influenced by state policies and 
regulations concerning municipal employees’ wages and 
level of retirement and health care benefits. 3 This basic 
fact should give pause to those who instinctively attribute 
chronic local fiscal distress to “profligate spending on public 
employees” (Greenhut, 2012, pp. 1-2) or “spiraling labor 
and pension costs” (Rozansky, 2012). To borrow again from 
Frug and Barron’s seminal work (2008, p. 199), “Although 
cities are often criticized for granting overly generous 
pensions and health care to their employees, sometimes 
they become supporters of municipal employees’ benefits 
because the state requires them to do so.” Our more general 
argument here is that it is foolish to claim to correctly 
diagnose the causes of local fiscal distress without careful 
examination of the spending context in which states place 
their cities. In this paper, we aim to capture a large slice 
of this expenditure-side context by assessing state public 
sector collective bargaining policies (specifically, those 
covering municipal police, firefighters, teachers and other 
local employees) and public employee union membership 
coverage. 


2 Via specific provisions (or the absence of such provisions) regarding 
local statutory authorization, budgetary constraints or more general 
interpretations of local governments’ home rule authority. 

3 For instance, Michigan, even after the adoption of right-to-work 
legislation in late 2012, mandates binding arbitration for public safety 
officers in the event that involved parties in a labor contract dispute 
cannot reach an agreement. Massachusetts pays out benefits to local 
employees through the State-Boston Retirement System via formulas 
established by state law. Illinois law does not mandate city or employee 
benefit or contribution levels, instead favoring local flexibility in the 
control over pension costs. 




The final segment of this section considers how these 
revenue- and expenditure-side pressures interact within 
and across all U.S. state governments. As one might expect 
(or at least hope), these two competing dimensions tend 
to work against one another. States that are more revenue 
stick (meaning local tax limitation increases outpace 
the distribution of state aid) tend not to impose equally 
exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least in relation to 
local labor costs. For many states that do drive up labor 
and service costs via their mixture of policies, these costs 
are at least partially offset via a more resilient and vibrant 
aid environment, coupled with limited own-source revenue 
restrictions. A few states, such as Michigan and California, 
place strict limits on local own-source revenues while at the 
same time providing only meager intergovernmental aid and 
imposing costly labor and service obligations. We contend 
that these states have structured local fiscal policymaking 
in a way that effectively incubates local financial distress. 
These state contexts are the most egregious in hampering 
the exercise of local fiscal power; yet the nature of the 
problem for cities may be much worse - state-imposed 
budgetary imbalances can engender recurring structural 
deficits and diminished local service capacity, particularly 
among the states’ older, industrial urban areas.

State governments, by virtue of their superior constitutional 
position, have sweeping legal powers to regulate local 
finance. Central to our assessment of the state’s role 
in local fiscal distress are state controls over the two 
dominant sources of city revenue: state aid and local

State Aid Environment Since 1970 


taxes. Local governments occupy a weak position in the 
American federal system, causing local officials to rely 
heavily on, in the words of one analyst, “whatever sources 
of income the states are willing to let them tap into” or 
“whatever financial assistance” the states are willing to 
provide (Berman, 2003, p. 89). Sbragia (1983) aptly refers 
to the condition of American federalism as “the municipal 
money chase,” and in the absence of a vibrant federal aid 
environment in the United States, state aid - in the form 
of shared taxes (typically sales, income and gasoline) and 
restricted or unrestricted grants - continues to be a major 
source of local government revenue, accounting for roughly 
a third of local revenue, on average, during the past two 
decades (Berman, 2003; Urahn et al., 20 12). 4 

The importance of a well-designed state aid system is hard 
to overstate. It allows local officials greater flexibility in 
responding to economic pressures and the service needs of 
residents. This flexibility is particularly valuable during 
periods of economic downturn. Because local governments 
vary widely in their tax bases and in their ability to raise 
critical own-source revenues, influential research illustrates 
the equalizing potential of state aid, particularly in helping 
to smooth out revenue gaps between wealthier and poorer 
local jurisdictions (Pelissero, 1984; Stein and Hamm, 1987). 
In the past few decades, very few states target aid to local 
governments as a function of local need (Stein and Hamm, 

4 Though formulas for the distribution of local aid can vary significantly 
across states (as well as within states over time), all states provide 
some form of aid to local governments - often from a historical 
exchange in which cities would forgo the right to collect certain taxes 
in exchange for the states returning revenues from those taxes in some 
form. States typically allocate shared revenue for specific purposes 
or link it to particular functions of local government. Some shared 
revenue, however, is unhindered by such state restrictions and can be 
spent as local lawmakers see fit.

1994). The level of state aid that is available can make 
it possible for certain jurisdictions - for instance, older, 
industrial cities experiencing significant job loss coupled 
with a much reduced tax base - to at least afford minimum 
levels of services and possibly respond to growing service 
demands on the heels of a crippling state or national 
recession (see Ladd and Yinger, 1994). 

How then can we characterize the critical state aid portion 
of the state-controlled revenue environment for American 
cities? Figure 1, which illustrates trends in per capita state 

aid to three classes of city governments, shows a steady Figure 2. The Uneven Development of State Aid 

upward trend in transfers (per capita) received from state Environments 

governments. Though it is beyond the scope of this project 
to analyze specific revenue-sharing rules and aid formulas 
over time and across state contexts, our city financial data 
allow us to compare important trends in what the Census 
of Governments classifies as “Total Intergovernmental 
Revenue from the State Government.” 5 In other words, we 
plot data indicating the fiscal outputs of these rules and 
decisions. As Figure 1 illustrates, the positive trend over 
time is particularly strong for cities with populations over 
100, 000. 6 On average, it would seem that state governments 
have helped at least larger cities meet increasingly 
difficult financial conditions through the extension of 
intergovernmental transfers. 

Figure 2, which compares levels and growth of per capita 
state aid across the contiguous 48 states, paints a bleaker 
portrait. Consistent with the findings presented in Figure 
1, 43 of the 48 states exhibit positive growth rates, meaning 
that roughly 90 percent of the lower 48 states provided 
higher levels of aid in the current era than in the early 1970s 
(mean increase = 256 percent). Figure 1, however, masks 
the considerable unevenness with which state governments 
deliver aid. This unevenness is on display in Figure 2, 
where fewer states provide above average levels of aid, and 
most states exhibit relatively flat growth in the distribution 
of state aid. 7 


5 This includes state grants-in-aid, regardless of basis of distribution; 
local share of state-collected taxes; payments in lieu of taxes on 
state property; and reimbursement for services performed for state 
government (e.g., care of state prisoners in local jails, construction 
or maintenance of state highway facilities, etc.) (U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, 2006). 

6 In 1970, these cities received roughly $160 per capita (in real 2005 
dollars) in state intergovernmental revenue; in 2005, the most recent 
year in our time series, average per capita aid was $470. Though the 
growth rate for small and medium-sized cities is not as steep, the 
steady uptick in average per capita state aid exemplifies a healthier 
state aid environment than in the past. 

7 As is indicated by the maroon-colored vertical line, the average 
per capita aid provided to local governments in 2005 was just over 
$340. Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and Utah provided around $40 per 
person, on average. New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, on the other hand, distributed intergovernmental 
revenue at an annual rate at or around $1,000 per resident.

One key reason for this unevenness is that state aid tends to 
ebb and flow with changing state-level economic conditions 
(Berman, 2003, pp. 100-102). More generally, state 
intergovernmental aid - particularly those discretionary 
resources distributed via statutory aid policies and 
unprotected by state constitutions - is inextricably linked 
to state legislative budget battles. State legislatures and 
governors, scrambling to balance their own budgets, are 
simply more likely to risk citizen backlash from significant 
aid cuts during periods of widespread budget shortfalls. 
What is more, state lawmakers across the country seem to 
be looking with decreasing favorability on the idea of, in 
the derisive words of one Wisconsin legislator, “being an 
ATM machine for local governments” (Rinard, 1999, p. 1). 

Figure 2, however, illustrates that not all states have chosen 
to respond to their revenue difficulties by making cuts 
to intergovernmental aid. A study from Pew’s American 
Cities Project reports that Connecticut, which provides 
one of the more vibrant aid environments in the country, 
chose to slightly bolster intergovernmental aid to its 
local governments on the heels of the Great Recession (in 
fiscal year 2010) and has not reported a cut since then. 
Nebraska, on the other hand, canceled all funding to its 
local governments in 2011; Maryland, California, Arizona, 
Nevada, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming made 5 
to 6 percent cuts that same year. All else being equal, we 
would expect it to be far less onerous to balance revenue 
and expenditure flows in city governments in states such 
as Connecticut, New York or Massachusetts - i.e., states 
where key state decision makers seem less inclined to 
shift service costs to local governments via cuts in state 
aid during times of state financial stress - than in cities 

Figure 3. Proliferation and 
Layering of TELs Since 1970 


facing similar sets of environmental, political or managerial 
conditions in states that provide lower or more volatile 
levels of intergovernmental aid. 

State policies regarding levels and delivery of state aid are 
but one piece of an increasingly complex set of structures 
that govern local revenue capacity. In a classic textbook 
on American intergovernmental relations, Stephens and 
Wikstrom (2006, p. 196) remark, “Without doubt, the most 
important mechanism that the state has for influencing 
the political behavior of local officials involves financial 
assistance.” This may have been true in the 1970s or 1980s, 
and to be sure it is a fundamental tenet of traditional 
models of fiscal federalism, but the most important 
mechanism for controlling local fiscal behavior in the past 
quarter- century is the tax and expenditure limit (TEL) - 
a label that broadly captures state attempts to limit the 
taxing and/or spending authority of its local governments 
through constitutional amendment or legislative enactment. 

State governments have long imposed some manner of 
TEL. 8 Figure 3 tracks the adoption of TELs since 1970 
across the four most common categories: rate limits - which 
are overall or specific tax rate limits that set the ceiling on 
the aggregate tax rate, which cannot be exceeded without 
a vote of the electorate; property tax levy limits, which 
constrain the total amount of revenue that can be raised 
from the property tax (independent of the property tax 
rate); assessment increase limits, which cap the growth rate of 
assessed values and is intended to control the ability of 
local government to raise revenue either by reassessment 
of property or through escalation of property values; and 

8 For instance, the first states to establish property tax rate limits were 
Rhode Island (1870), Nevada (1895), Oklahoma (1907) and Ohio (1911). 



8 




limits on general revenue or general expenditure increases, which 
set the maximum growth rate of total revenue or total 
spending. 


Whereas a great deal of research has shown that the 
appearance of even a single TEL constrains the capacity 
of local officials to generate revenues on their own (see 
Poterba and Rueben, 1995; Shadbegian, 1996, 1999; it is 
the accumulation or layering of fiscal constraints that can 
be particularly damaging to the revenue capacity of local 
lawmakers. 9 In single-TEL states, for instance, raising 
assessments might be employed to circumvent property 
tax rate limits and vice versa; in states that impose only 
an assessment cap, this single limitation could potentially 
be overcome by adopting a higher rate. These methods 
of circumvention were common early in the 1970s, when 
24 of the 29 states adopting some form of TEL imposed 
only one constraint (mostly rate limits), and a mere five 
states imposed two revenue TELs. Today, at least 27 of 
the contiguous 48 states impose multiple revenue TELs. 
Nineteen states impose two, and eight states - Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Mexico and Washington - apply three local tax limitations. 

The number of TELs in a state does not necessarily capture 
the severity of the limitation(s), though it is reasonable 
to expect a higher frequency of TELs to create a more 
restrictive local tax environment. Figure 4 displays a 
measure of TEL severity (see appendix regarding our 
research approach beginning on page 25), with the open 
point illustrating the severity of the state’s TEL in 1970, 
the closed (maroon) point plotting restrictiveness in 2005, 
and the dashed horizontal line representing the change 
in severity of the state’s tax limitations. 10 Figure 4 reveals 
some noteworthy patterns that illustrate the reality of state 
policy choices regarding local tax structures. Michigan, a 
state that imposes one of the more onerous sets of revenue 
restrictions, achieved this status via a one-two punch of 
major constitutional amendments enacted by voters: the 
Headlee Amendment in 1978 and Proposal A in 1994. 11 The 
Headlee Amendment capped local property tax millage 
rates to the rate of inflation. Proposal A - a constitutional 
amendment quite similar to Proposition 13 in California, a 
state with a similarly restrictive fiscal relationship with its 
locales - further limited local property tax revenue growth 

9 Rising adoption rates are on display in Figure 3. So, too, is the 
increasingly common phenomenon of TEL layering, meaning the 
imposition of state-imposed controls on multiple elements of the 
local tax structure. And those controls are growing: in 1970, 29 of the 
contiguous 48 states had at least one revenue TEL; today, some 41 of 48 
states have at least one local revenue limit. 

10 The measure of TEL severity, initially proposed by Amiel, Deller and 
Stallmann (2009), indexes six key characteristics: the type of TEL (see 
discussion above), if the TEL is statutory or constitutional, growth 
restrictions, method of TEL approval, TEL overrides and exemptions, 
and method of override. For a more detailed discussion of this 
measure, see Amiel, Deller, and Stallmann (2009) and Maher and 
Deller (2013).

by changing the system of assessment to cap individual 
property values and prohibiting cities from “rolling up” 
a millage to the rate of inflation if actual property value 
growth was lower than inflation. 12 Taken together, these 
two large TEL ratchets, which came 17 years apart and 
layered on top of an already aggressive property tax rate 
limit, placed tremendous pressure on local lawmakers’ 
ability to generate critical revenue (Brunori et al., 2008). 
Contrast Michigan’s approach to that of Massachusetts’s 
Prop 2 Vi, a similarly infamous state-imposed TEL, which 
was passed by referendum in 1980 and effectively caps 
local property tax levies at 2.5 percent of real property 
value. Massachusetts’s relatively moderate position on the 
severity index owes much to the state’s choice to apply no 
corresponding rate, revenue or assessment limits on local 
lawmakers. 

TELs, taken alone, are neither inherently good nor bad. 

They have been alternately portrayed as necessary evils 
for taming “Leviathan” city governments (Brennan and 
Buchanan, 1979; Craw, 2008; Downes and Figlio, 1999), 
or as just plain evils that stifle cities’ abilities to pursue 
innovative visions for their futures (Frug and Barron, 

2008). 13 However, over three decades after the tax revolt 
movement took hold in a major way in states such as 
California and Michigan, the widespread adoption of local 
TELs depicted in Figures 1 and 2 has had two overarching 
effects: the first is the loss of local revenues; the second is 
decreasing local reliance on property taxes. 14 There is little 
evidence to suggest that TELs, however, promote local fiscal 
sustainability. The reason is that local spending mostly 
goes unaffected by revenue limits (Dye and McGuire, 1997), 
particularly in the absence of state-imposed spending lids, 
which exist in only a small handful of states. 15 

In sum, the proliferation of state-imposed TELs has 
helped to create a national state-local fiscal system that 
is simply less conducive to local governments’ abilities to 
fund their own activities. 15 States with more aggressive 
local TELs - such as Michigan, Colorado and California 

12 Many other provisions of both the Headlee Amendment and Proposal 
A are related to other parts of the state finance system, and a detailed 
examination of the depth of both laws would be a paper unto itself. 

We will discuss the impacts of these types of laws, generally and in 
Michigan, later in the paper. 

13 To be sure, they are a frequent source of local consternation, 
particularly as fixed costs occupy a larger share of local budgets and 
demand for services - driven by postrecession unemployment rates, 
population changes and other factors - continues to rise. 

14 Indeed, in many state contexts, forgone property tax revenues have at 
least partially been recovered via more regressive revenue sources - 
such as fees and, where allowed, sales taxes. 

15 This is an important point that is often obscured by the frequent 
reliance on the TEL acronym (Tax and Expenditure Limits). 

16 Amidst the national clamor for government austerity and fiscal 
responsibility, it is important to point out that these activities - 
particularly in the states that impose the most formidable set of 
revenue constraints, such as Michigan, California and Colorado - 
include essential local services such as public safety and infrastructure 
maintenance, which are critical functions of local government. 


- hinder the revenue capacity of their local governments. 
This capacity is vital during even the most moderate of 
economic downturns because service demands tend to 
rise and state aid tends to drop. Revenue slack, however, 
was particularly vital during the most recent recession. In 
previous downturns, home prices mostly remained stable, 
thus steadying property tax revenues (particularly in 
relation to sales and income taxes). In the 2009 recession, 
property tax revenues, already slowed in certain states 
via state-imposed TELs, plummeted in simultaneity with 
state aid. The good news, as we illustrate below, is that 
a relatively small number of states impose such crippling 
revenue constraints from both ends: meaning states 
that both limit own-source revenue capacity while also 
providing far from vibrant levels of state aid. The bad news 
is that, for local officials who must operate within those 
state environments, even small declines in revenues can 
present tremendous budgetary challenges. 

Napping the Revenue Squeeze: Revenue 
“Carrot" and Revenue “Stick” States 

As property tax revenues continue to erode as a function 
of state-imposed TELs and local governments have become 
more reliant on state aid, some observers have suggested 
that state governments have responded to their expanding 
role in local fiscal affairs by providing greater levels of 
intergovernmental revenues (Berman, 2003; Sokolow, 2000; 
Dye and McGuire, 1997b). 17 This reading of state-local fiscal 
dynamics is somewhat supported by comparing trends in 
average levels of state aid to local governments exhibited 
in Figure 1 and total revenue limit adoptions depicted in 
Figure 3. However, our data allow for a far more detailed 
look at how local revenue capacity is being affected by state 
policies for local governments within each of the lower 48 
states. 

Figure 5 depicts a rough state-level indicator of the severity 
of state restrictions on local revenue capacity. States for 
which our standardized measure of per capita state aid 
far exceeds our standardized measure of the severity of 
local revenue limits - such as Connecticut, New York, 
Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey - 
are depicted in orange and labeled revenue carrot states. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be buttressed by 
their state context. As was pointed out above, a well- 
structured state aid environment increases the overall fiscal 
capacity of local governments and, according to Pagano and 
Hoene (2010, p. 260), can provide “a level of equalization 
and base support for municipalities that may lack other 
resources.” Additional value to local revenue capacity 
stems from the fact that critical own-source revenues are 

17 Greater local reliance on state aid does not necessarily mean that 
state officials have “anteed up,” a point that, mainly because of data 
constraints, is too often overlooked.

either altogether unencumbered by the absence of state 
TELs, as in Connecticut; limited only on the margins, as in 
Rhode Island or Tennessee; or limited via more aggressive 
TELs offset via significant funding from the state, as in 
Massachusetts. 

Revenue stick states - such as Michigan, Colorado, 

Washington and California - are depicted in brown. These 
state governments (or state citizens via the referendum or 
initiative process) constrain the fiscal autonomy of local 

government officials rather than buttress it via state aid. Figure 5. Revenue “Carrot” and Revenue “Stick” 
An extensive body of research on the local effects of state- States 
imposed TELs strongly suggests that revenue limits have 
worked: local own-source revenues have been reduced in 
the states that impose such limitations. Though there is 
some historical evidence that state legislatures in certain 
states have offset these limitations via state aid (Mullins 
and Joyce, 1996), revenue stick states tend to be far less 
generous in the allocation of intergovernmental revenue. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be constrained by 
their state context. 

Michigan, for instance, has a TEL score well above the 
most recent annual state average, coupled with slightly 
below average state aid. The problem with local fiscal 
sustainability in revenue stick states such as Michigan 
stems from local governments’ heightened reliance on 
state revenues, which in Michigan is a function of two 
large TEL ratchets and, in the post-Great Recession period, 
sharply declining property tax revenues. This high degree 
of dependency remains in place today. Yet, much like the 
way that Michigan’s Proposition A has exposed critical local 
education funding to state budgetary battles (Cullen and 
Loeb, 2004), the state’s unyielding property tax rate limits, 
coupled with special features of the Headlee Amendment 
that forbid the use of some alternative revenue sources 
employed in other states (e.g., income, sales and motor fuel 
taxes), have had the unfortunate side effect of essentially 
entwining local fiscal health with state legislative politics. 

As the state economy faltered under a one-state recession 
throughout much of the 2000s (Darga, 2011), the past 
decade has seen both clear declines in statutory revenue 
sharing and heightened levels of uncertainty over revenue- 
sharing rules (Lavelle, 2014, pp. 2-3). 

Michigan’s is a precarious fiscal context even for the most 
well-managed city government. It is particularly onerous 
for lawmakers in older, industrial cities such as Flint, 
which has been dealing for some time with sustained 
job and population loss, waning bureaucratic capacity, 
and increasingly daunting economic, social and physical 
challenges (see Doidge et al., 2015). In the words of one 
local official, if aid is reduced, “It’s not rocket science ... 
pretty much raise taxes or cut services. That’s what it boils 
down to” (McDermott and Powers, 2002, p. 12). Local 
lawmakers in a state such as Michigan, where they operate 



11 




with very limited discretion over revenue capacity, can boil 
it down even further: reduce or eliminate services or face 
the prospects of possible financial meltdown. All cities face 
political constraints on raising tax revenue. And certainly, 
some cities have managed their financial affairs in the face 
of economic decline better than others. However, for those 
seeking to fully grasp the nature of local fiscal health, we 
must continue to focus on ways in which states effectively 
create a mismatch between fiscal needs and available 
resources into their cities’ local fiscal decision-making 
environment.

In addition to the revenue squeeze that some states impose 
on their local governments, state governments also impose 
a range of expenditure-side pressures that can drive up 
local costs. 18 As state governments continue to streamline 
bureaucracies and downsize operations, service burdens 
have been shifted onto local governments, often “without 
careful consideration whether this was the correct 
course” (Gold and Wallin, 1999, p. 73). As one prominent 
National League of Cities report argues (2003, p. 23), the 
transference of “program responsibilities from state and 
federal government, as well as the imposition of state and 
federal mandates, increase the roles and responsibilities of 
municipal governments, often without corresponding fiscal 
capacity or authority.” Observers and analysts interested 
in the expenditure-side burdens that state policies place 
on local officials typically focus on the effects that costly 
mandates in areas such as health care and pollution 
abatement have on local government budgets (see Berman, 
2003, pp. 77-83). Far less attention is paid to what we might 
call de facto spending pressures - the hidden but potentially 
damaging state-level decisions, policies and institutions 
that can destabilize local governments’ fiscal capacity. 

Consider, as we do in this report, local governments’ large 
and increasing burden to pay for previously obligated 
labor costs. Labor costs, including wages and benefits 
for current employees as well as pensions and other 
postemployment benefits (OPEB) such as retiree healthcare, 
currently make up the largest category of operating costs 
for local governments. As pointed out in a recent MSU 
white paper (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013), municipalities 
were not required to measure the total costs of OPEB 
until an accounting standard was issued in 2004, with 
implementation beginning in 2007. Now that local 
governments have calculated and accounted for OPEB, 

18 This general phenomenon has been termed “second-order devolution” 

- meaning the transfer of program administration and/or substantive 
policy powers from the federal and state governments to America’s 
cities and municipalities (see Bowman and Kearney, 2011). 


many are faced with a massive commitment. Indeed, 

MSU’s review of Michigan cities facing severe fiscal stress 
revealed that each city was confronted with a substantial 
unfunded OPEB liability (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013). 

Though local government employee pensions and OPEB 
are seemingly always in the headlines, few seem to be 
asking why observers are more able to link labor costs 
to local fiscal distress in certain states than in others. 

Why do we hear so much about Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
California, Rhode Island and New Jersey? The answer, 
not surprisingly, is that, although city lawmakers are 
often criticized for overly cozy relationships with public 
employee labor unions (see, for instance, Gillette, 2014a; 
Rozansky, 2012; Greenhut, 2012), critical elements of 
employee benefit costs are structured by state law. State 
law may require bargaining by the employer, may provide 
only for a bargaining forum without requiring it or, 
alternatively, may simply prohibit collective bargaining 
altogether. State laws vary in the coverage of certain types 
of local employees. These rules address the types of items 
that may be bargained over, such as work rules, pay and 
benefits. Finally, the collective bargaining laws may include 
a process for dealing with impasses, such as binding 
arbitration rules. In line with the framework proposed 
at this report’s outset, we view the mix of these rules as a 
set of processes and constraints that directly influence a 
municipality’s fiscal capacity. 

Table 1 places the local public employee collective 
bargaining environment of the contiguous 48 states into a 
five-category classification scheme ranging from very weak 
to very strong. (See the research approach appendix for 
a more detailed explanation of this measure.) As Table 
1 makes plain, states vary with respect to the collective 
bargaining environment for local public employees. Not 
surprisingly, states with strong and very strong collective 
bargaining environments (e.g., those that impose a duty 
to bargain with strong union security provisions) have 
comparatively high union membership rates as well, 
with New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, 
Pennsylvania and Michigan each holding union membership 
rates in excess of 50 percent of state public employees. 
Unionization rates in weak and very weak states, such as 
Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, New Mexico, 
Wyoming, Utah, Georgia and Virginia, on the other hand, 
tend to fall around 10 percent. 19 

State laws concerning pensions and health benefits 
illustrate, in part, how state-imposed structures affect city 
expenditure choices. Yet recent attention to employee 
compensation, pension system funding/underfunding 
and, especially, the cumulative impact of local government 
employee costs on current municipal cash flows have 

19 Statistics from Union Membership and Coverage Database (see Hirsch 
and Macpherson, 2003). 


12 



brought these issues, in particular, into national focus. To 
be clear, we do not suggest that a non-unionized workforce 
is the key to a fiscally sustainable city. City governments 
must compete with other employers for workers, and 
rules governing bargaining are part of a state’s larger 
labor culture. Our simple argument is that, in light of the 
sizeable role for local labor costs in local budgeting as well 
the implementation of new accounting standards, city 
governments operating within states with more permissive 
collective bargaining provisions are more likely to face 
budgetary constraints. It is easy to pin these constraints 
on lousy decision making, yet these constraints owe much 
to higher labor costs and the cumulative costs of payment 
decisions that are, to a large degree, governed by state 
policy. 

C3) The Stale Context for Local 
Fiscal Distress^ Tension Between 
Hexenne and Expenditure Pressures 

Analysis of the interplay of revenue and expenditure 
pressures allows for a more detailed assessment of the 
nature of the fiscal context in which states place their 


local lawmakers. We offer this analysis as something of a 
corrective to the typical perception that a city’s financial 
destiny is either entirely within or entirely outside of its 
control. When assessing why certain local governments 
seem to respond more effectively to their financial problems 
than others, our research suggests that identifying on 
Figure 6 (see page 14) the state in which the city is located 
is a good place to start. The state’s coordinates represent 
an empirical measure of the state context for local fiscal 
distress - meaning the tension for local lawmakers between 
state- imposed revenue-side pressures (captured on the 
horizontal axis) and state-imposed expenditure-side 
pressures (captured on the vertical axis). 20 

20 More technically, the horizontal axis captures our measure of the 
revenue pressures that states inflict upon their local governments 
(standardized TEL severity score minus standardized average per 
capita aid score). The vertical axis represents a standardized measure 
of public employee union coverage, an approximation of the severity 
of the average city’s relatively fixed labor costs. The light gray 
shading represents the distance between one quartile above and one 
quartile below the median; thus states that appear outside these two 
intersecting ranges are quite different from average on both elements of 
the state context. Dark shaded points indicate state governments that 
authorize state intervention in financially distressed local governments.

If state-imposed revenue pressures increased with the 
severity of expenditure pressures, or vice versa, we would 
expect a positive “best fit” line (the dark curving line in 
Figure 6) moving from the lower left-hand quadrant to 
the upper right. As one might expect (or at least hope), 
these two elements of the state context tend to offset each 
other. States such as Colorado and New Mexico - i.e., 
more revenue stick states (local tax limitation increases 
outpace growth in the distribution of state aid) - avoid 
equally exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least when 
it comes to local labor costs. For states that do structure 
local collective bargaining in a way that favors higher local 
labor costs - such as New York, Connecticut and Rhode 
Island - these costs are at least partially offset by a more 
resilient and vibrant aid environment, coupled with limited 
own-source revenue restrictions. 

The relationship between these two elements of the state 
context is negative, but it is not a purely linear relationship. 
Figure 6’s most striking feature is its illustration that states 
placing extreme limitations on local revenue capacity 
(meaning they are more than one standard deviation 
above the state average on the horizontal axis) also tend to 
impose costly labor and service obligations (more than one 
standard deviation above the state average on the vertical 
axis). This relationship between revenue and expenditure 
pressures creates a best-fit line that resembles a backwards 
“J”. This small handful of states that pull the line upward 
- which include Michigan and California - cluster in the 
upper right-hand quadrant of Figure 6. It is no surprise 
that acute financial emergencies have clustered in these 
states. We contend that they have structured local fiscal 
policymaking in a way that effectively incubates financial 
distress. Table 2 classifies the states in an effort to clearly 
represent the position of each of the lower 48 states along 
these two dimensions. 


The threat of recurring structural deficits is “baked in” to 
the state-imposed legal and policy context in which local 
governments choose how to respond to fiscal problems. For 
lawmakers in America’s older, industrial cities who must 
operate within these states, that choice is often not theirs 
to make. As we point out above, these states apply revenue 
and expenditure pressures on the front end, while also 
fostering a fiscal environment that exacerbates fiscal stress, 
links local fiscal health to budgetary battles, and all in all 
restricts the policy “space” for local fiscal policymaking. 
Michigan, however, is the only state among the incubators 
in the top right quadrant of Table 2 and Figure 6 that also 
intervenes “on the back end” by assertively implementing 
one of the nation’s most powerful fiscal distress 
intervention policies (Anderson, 2011; Scorsone, 2014). 

In light of the clustering of distressed localities within 
Michigan’s borders, it comes as little surprise that Michigan 
lawmakers would value a policy that allows state officials 
to help struggling local governments meet conditions of 
chronic fiscal stress (Scorsone and Bateson, 2011; Doidge 
et al., 2015). However, as we discuss below, what is quite 
striking is the relationship between the policy’s goals and 
design - which favors state takeover of local government 
- and the nature and underlying causes of the problem 
of acute fiscal distress. The financial consequences of 
deep-rooted economic and social forces are unlikely to 
be fully alleviated via temporary suspension of local self- 
government. Neither are the often overlooked but critically 
important state-imposed causes analyzed above. In what 
follows, we survey the state governments with more holistic 
and self-aware views of local financial distress in an effort 
to draw important lessons for Michigan lawmakers as they 
continue to struggle with chronic fiscal stress among the 
state’s localities. 


Section 2: If Takeover is the Solution, then 
what is the Problem? What Michigan Can 
Learn from the Ways in Which Other States 
Tackle Problems of Local Fiscal Distress 


In the previous section, we make the case that state 
governments influence how local officials meet their 
financial problems via a combination of laws and policies 
that add or take away intergovernmental or own-source 
revenue capacity and drive up expenditure pressures 
via the allocation of policy authority over government 
functions and labor costs. In certain instances, such as 
when a state government caps property tax revenue and 
sets near insurmountable override standards, the effects 
of certain elements of the state context may be more or 
less direct. A city facing a near identical set of political, 
institutional, economic and social circumstances that 
operates in a neighboring state with no such revenue cap 
at least has the potential to capitalize on this capacity, 
assuming local political and economic constraints allow for 
the imposition of a property tax increase. But mostly the 
effects of this state context are more indirect. The policy 
balance between revenue restrictions and state aid, for 
instance, is not so much a direct measure of state policy 
choice as it is an outcome of a variety of state policy choices 
- e.g., revenue-sharing rules and formulae, the outcomes of 
citizen initiatives involving local TELs, legislative-executive 
budgetary processes, bureaucratic turf battles and so on. 

Since as far back as the late 19* century, when the 
proliferation of railroad bankruptcies prompted states 
to take action to assist struggling localities (see Dimock, 
1935 and 1940), state lawmakers, for fear that “a failing 
municipality will lower the credit rating of other localities 
and the state itself” (Berman, 2003, p. 113), have played a 
far more direct role in responding to local financial distress. 
The current menu of state policy options for intervening in 
distressed communities has been reviewed in two recent 
reports, one by Pew Charitable Trust researchers (Atwell et 
al., 2013) and a second by one of the authors of this report 
(Scorsone, 2014). One key shortcoming of these reports 
is the absence of detailed consideration of state context. 
Simply put, some states are part of the problem - they 
incubate financial distress via stringent restrictions on 
local revenue capacity and state policies precipitating local 
spending pressures. In other states, local policy options 
regarding the balance of revenue and expenditure flows are 
less encumbered by state policies and institutions. This 
diversity among state contexts is particularly important 
when reflecting on “best practices” for states dealing with 


acute local fiscal distress. For instance, close followers 
of issues of local finance often hear and read about North 
Carolina’s strong oversight and monitoring mechanisms 
as standards to which state governments should aspire 
(see, for instance, Mattoon, 2014). But does it make sense 
for a state such as Michigan or New Jersey, for instance, 
to adhere to similar policy principles when local fiscal 
policymaking is structured in such dramatically different 
ways? 

A second shortcoming of these reports is the dearth of 
detailed comparison among the 18 state governments that 
currently have an intervention policy. We refer readers 
to these reports for their quality in cataloguing the formal 
policy powers of state lawmakers on paper. Neither, 
however, is as useful at considering these policies in 
practice. This is a key tension in policy analysis generally 
and in instances of intervention in particular. The choice 
of the state’s appointed and elected officials to employ 
the power they have at their disposal and intervene in 
a distressed community (often meaning the temporary 
suspension of democratic processes) presents a particular 
type of implementation dilemma imbued with questions of 
racial bias, social and economic imbalances, and the legal 
and political culture that guides state-local relations. 

To fully assess the role of state governments in financial 
distress, we held a workshop for state government officials, 
analysts and experts with deep knowledge of state 
operations in local financial affairs. The Workshop on State 
Intervention in Distressed Communities, held in the fall 
of 2014 in Detroit, ultimately brought together a diverse 
group of 28 practitioners and policy experts from six states 
facing similar sets of local fiscal problems: Michigan, Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. 21 
The appendix provides a detailed overview of the structure 
of the event and the types of discussions that were held. 

Our primary goal was to provide a venue facilitating the 
open exchange of ideas and techniques for approaching the 
complicated problems facing cities in fiscal crisis. Indeed, 
as we discuss below, one recommendation of this research 

21 This portion of the process focused specifically on how states approach 
intervention. Though many of the participants in the workshop 
were intimately involved in making decisions at the city level, we 
intentionally chose participants representing the state perspective 
rather than that of local decision makers. 


16 




report is to continue to advance this and similarly minded 
endeavors as a means of facilitating what Peter May (1992) 
refers to as “instrumental policy learning,” which can 
improve state officials’ understanding of the benefits and 
limitations of particular policy approaches or administrative 
designs. A second goal centers on learning more about the 
states’ implementation processes for deciding whether to 
designate a city in distress, take it over temporarily or, in 
the most extreme cases, help shepherd its path to municipal 
bankruptcy. Our final goal was to investigate the types of 
“causal stories” (Stone, 2011) that state officials and experts 
used when considering the fiscal conditions facing their 
local governments. We held structured discussions about 
how the problem of local fiscal distress is defined (i.e., who 
or what bears the responsibility) and the ways in which 
state governments enshrine this problem definition via the 
design and implementation of financial emergency policies. 

In what follows, we begin with a brief outline of Michigan’s 
approach to local financial emergencies, paying special 
attention to linkages between the state’s policy solutions, 
the nature of fiscal stress in Michigan’s municipalities 
and the “front-end” context identified in Section 1. We 
then turn to alternative approaches employed in other key 
states. We begin with North Carolina, a state whose Local 
Government Commission, which administers the policy 
for dealing with financially challenged communities, has 
received a great deal of national credit. We then move 
to states facing more comparable sets of local conditions 
- i.e., with many older, industrial and fiscally vulnerable 
local governments suffering from population and job 
loss - that also have a history of state intervention in 
fiscally distressed communities. The goal here is not 
comprehensive overview. Rather, we set out to identify 
key dissimilarities with the new generation of intervention 
policies - of which Michigan’s current policy is the poster 
child - and to illustrate how state governments facing 
similar sets of challenges can more effectively align their 
policy regarding direct involvement in fiscally distressed 
communities with the nature of problems that these 
communities face, as well as with state-imposed constraints 
that hamper their capacity to balance revenue and 
expenditure flows. 

We designed Table 3 (see page 18) to help guide this 
discussion. The first two columns summarize the state 
context analyzed in Section 1 of this report. The four 
rightmost columns depict information summarizing the 
design and administration of the state’s local financial 
emergency policy. The column labeled “causal story” 
reflects our assessment of how a state government, via its 
legislation of state intervention, comes down on the debate 
over the causes of local financial failure. For some states, 
the focal point is internal causes - poor management, the 
incompetence of local leaders, political corruption, the 
dominance over policymaking by narrow interests, and/or 


“antidemocratic” structures and processes that favor the 
whims of local officials over the needs of local residents 
(Gillette, 2014b). Other states focus on forces external to 
local management - i.e., socioeconomic conditions that 
are at once causes and symptoms of diminishing local 
service capacity and resources (see Kimhi, 2008), such 
as high and concentrated poverty, older building stocks, 
residential vacancies, high crime, deep-rooted regional 
changes, population loss and job loss. The column labeled 
“policy approach” captures the gist of the state’s approach 
to financially distressed communities and reinforces the 
causal theory behind the policy’s design. We also include 
information on the administration of the states’ policies. 
Here the focus is on the powers of key administrative actors 
and their bureaucratic location. In line with a great deal of 
research on policy analysis and the policymaking process, 
we structure Table 3 in a way that suggests that key state 
decisions on goals, administration and implementation flow 
from how responsibility for the problem is assigned - i.e., 
the causal story (see Stone, 2011, p. 206). This information 
is provided for the six states that were represented at the 
Detroit workshop - Michigan, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio - as well as for North 
Carolina, a state that frequently gains attention for the 
effectiveness of its intervention policy. 

CD Michigan's Local Financial 
Stability and Choice Actt A Brave 
New World for State Intervention 

The tenets of Michigan’s intervention policy have been 
well-documented in research reports and news media. 

After the governor declares a fiscal emergency, 22 four 
possible courses of action are available to a municipality, 23 
though local takeover by an emergency manager (EM) is 
the most common course of action. This allows a state- 
appointed manager to “act for and in the place and stead 
of the governing body and the office of chief administrative 
officer of the local government” and effectively grants this 
individual powers beyond those available to local officials. 24 
Not only does he or she become responsible for all local 
fiscal decisions, including development and implementation 
of a recovery plan (which must be approved by the state 
treasurer), but the EM can also modify existing collective 
bargaining agreements, negotiate new union contracts and 
make personnel changes. The EM can also explore the 
option of consolidating services with another government 
entity, sell municipal assets and ask voters to increase the 
tax rate. The EM remains in this role until the city reaches 
certain benchmarks within its recovery plan, and a

the local unit of government to pay creditors or make timely pension 
contributions - prior to a state review of a local unit’s finances

receivership transition board is appointed by the governor 
to assist in transition until the official termination of 
receivership. 

The structure of Michigan’s successive intervention laws 
and the powers granted to the emergency manager point 
to a particular type of causal story - local government 
mismanagement as the chief barrier to fiscal solvency. The 
state’s solutions and assistance all center on correcting 
local decisions that led to chronic budget shortfalls, and 
the main focus of Michigan’s law, which is administered by 
the Department of Treasury, is to ensure a balanced budget. 
Efforts to achieve short-term fiscal solvency typically center 
on reductions in cities’ financial obligations - e.g., cutting 
pension obligations, making personnel cuts and contracting 
out services traditionally provided by local governments. 
EMs and other state officials have little leeway to affect the 
revenue side of local governments’ ledgers. As Anderson 
(2011, p. 620) argues, the viewpoint being expressed by the 
design and implementation of Michigan’s policy is “that the 
current revenue picture of the city is adequate to provide 
for public safety, debt service, and other core expenses — if 
only ... the city had competent management.” Indeed, little 
or no financial support accompanies state takeover. This 
is a telling feature of the state law that sheds considerable 
light on both the degree to which the policy oversimplifies 
the causes of local fiscal distress and the mismatch between 
the administrator’s toolkit and the nature of the problem. 

To respond to the question at the outset of this section: if 
takeover is the solution, the problem is mismanagement. 
Michigan codifies this causal story in a way that is less 
adulterated than in any other state we have surveyed. In 
other words, the state has adopted and codified a vastly 
oversimplified story. Even Rhode Island, which granted 
similarly sweeping powers to its state-appointed emergency 
managers, offers additional assistance to cities approaching 
distress to help prevent full-fledged crises. The state 
has also seen EMs (called “receivers”) raise local taxes 
to generate more local revenue. This less than favorable 
assessment of Michigan’s policy is buttressed by the 
absence of emergency bailout funding, a traditional feature 
of the more aggressively implemented state intervention 
policies (Berman, 1995; Anderson, 2011), as well as meager 
revenue-raising powers. EMs are empowered to tackle 
city expenditures as a means of bringing local budgets into 
equilibrium, but revenue-raising powers are effectively 
more limited than the powers normally afforded a city’s 
mayor or council member. As has been pointed out 
elsewhere, for cities such as Flint, Ecorse, Benton Harbor 
and Pontiac, this is a gross oversimplification of the 
structural barriers to fiscal sustainability (Doidge et al., 
2015). Our aim in this report is not to disprove the notion 
that mismanagement is the cause. We merely point out that 
the policy’s design and implementation features devalue 
the considerable constraints that the state places on the 
revenue capacity of local officials. 


C2) Ttte Limited Applicability of 
ss B@st Practices**” Why Adoption of 
North €ar©IIna*s Policies Won*t Work 
for Michigan 

The reentry of Michigan’s cities into emergency 
management and the number of local governments and 
school districts in trouble have led to suggestions that 
Michigan should look elsewhere for answers. 25 A Pew 
Center on the States report suggests that North Carolina’s 
monitoring system has prevented fiscal distress despite a 
history of crises during the Great Depression and some of 
highest unemployment rates in the country (Pew Charitable 
Trusts, 2013). 

The Local Government Commission, a division of the North 
Carolina Treasury Department, reviews cities’ independent 
audits on key fiscal health indicators, particularly the 
level of fund balance. If a locality fails to meet a specific 
threshold, it is placed on the commission’s watch report 
and required to submit a plan of improvement. If local 
officials are unable to return the municipality to an 
acceptable level on their own, the commission assumes 
control of all local financial decisions, including taxing 
issues, until the problem is corrected. Additionally, the 
commission approves and sells all local bonds for public 
structure investments, which both increases the level 
of state oversight and reduces the potential for local 
mismanagement of debt. Bond agencies assign a premium 
to this monitoring system, considering it a model system 
(Coe, 2007). 

Features of North Carolina’s approach provide intriguing 
options for Michigan lawmakers, such as a codified, 
professional state office and extensive front-end monitoring 
to identify potential crises. However, evaluating these 
policies in isolation - i.e., in the absence of key contextual 
factors - is likely to overstate the potential success of North 
Carolina’s policies if they were to be enacted in Michigan. 

For instance, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2007, 
North Carolina had 548 municipalities, no other local 
general-purpose governments and 100 counties; Michigan 
had 533 cities and villages (municipalities), 1,242 townships 
and 83 counties. A consequence of Michigan having three 
times as many local governments as North Carolina is that 
the volume of reports that would need to be reviewed 
for monitoring purposes would be three times as great. 26 
Certainly this would require more resources devoted to 
oversight at the state level, thus putting additional stress on 
the state budget. 

The states differ greatly on other dimensions of the 
elements of state context identified in Section I. North 

25 http://www.crcmich.org/PUBLICAT/2000s/2000/memol053.pdf. 

26 This does not include the additional resources that would be required 
to monitor school districts, special districts or other governmental 
units. 


19 



Carolina has an obligatory state pension system; Michigan 
does not. In 1947, North Carolina declared it illegal for 
local governments to bargain with unions. 27 Conversely, 
Michigan’s local governments have a strong history of 
collective bargaining and excluded police and fire unions 
from 2012’s right-to-work legislation. Tax and expenditure 
limits, when averaged from 1970 through 2005, rank 
Michigan as the third most restrictive state in limits placed 
on local governments. North Carolina is 38 th - a property 
tax rate limit on counties and municipalities, set in 1973, 
has remained its only TEL. 

The differences in the state policy context between the 
two states suggest that Michigan should be cautious 
when drawing lessons from North Carolina as its model 
for intervention policies. We attribute North Carolina’s 
success in preventing municipalities from entering distress 
not to the design of its specific intervention policy but 
rather to a much tighter link between its policy approach 
and the state-imposed context for fiscal distress. 

C3) Hebyildlng State-Leeai 
Partnerships" ICey Insights 
from Piiede island* New jersey* 
Pennsylvania* Mew Yorlc and Ohio 

One of the more striking findings to emerge from our 
workshop and subsequent research is the difference 
between Michigan’s approach to local fiscal distress and 
the approaches of comparably situated state governments. 
These differences are laid bare in Table 3. Plainly put, state 
policies and institutions effectively incubate budgetary 
imbalances; yet lawmakers and administrators have ignored 
potential front-end damage when designing the policy 
aimed at helping communities in distress. Rhode Island, 
the state most comparable to Michigan in the priorities 
of its intervention policy and the powers granted to state 
receivers, also provides financial assistance to municipalities 
most in need, targeting aid to communities with a high 
property tax burden relative to taxpayer wealth through the 
state’s Distressed Communities Relief Fund thus buttressing 
the revenue capacity of its local governments. 28 With 
respect to this specific aspect of state context, Rhode Island 
generally provides higher levels of state aid. 

New Jersey and Pennsylvania: A More 
Comprehensive View of Local Financial 
Failure 

Beyond Rhode Island, Michigan lawmakers have a variety of 
states from which to learn about the viability of policy 


27 N.C. Gen. Stat. 95-78 to 84 (http://www.nrtw.org/right-work-states-

28 Established in 1990. Municipalities that fall in the bottom 20 percent 
of three of the law’s four indices qualify to receive state aid under the 
law. In the 2014 fiscal year, seven municipalities received funding

alternatives. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have enacted 
receivership laws that are quite different than Michigan and 
Rhode Island. Internal mismanagement is not eschewed 
entirely; rather it is considered alongside the external, 
structural dynamics with which local lawmakers must 
contend. This more holistic causal story both reinforces 
and is reinforced by choices that these states have made 
regarding implementation and administration. 

New Jersey’s policy of assisting cities during times of 
financial crisis originated in the Great Depression. Since 
that time, the state has built support within its bureaucracy 
to review and approve city budgets and offer financial 
and technical assistance as needed to prevent cities from 
entering bankruptcy. Rather than appointing a state- 
level official to take charge of a city' s finances (such as an 
emergency manager in Michigan), 29 Newjersey seeks to 
assist local officials in alleviating distress. This partnership 
is reflected in the mission statement of the Newjersey 
Division of Local Government Services (DLGS), a division 
of the Department of Community Affairs. It states that 
the DLGS “serves as an advocate for local Government 
interests,” provides assistance and is responsible for 
“financial integrity.” The DLGS provides advisory services 
to local governments, both once the community is identified 
as distressed and on request of the municipality, and also 
licenses and educates local officials. 

Not surprisingly, these two services help establish a 
partnership between state and local officials independent 
of the financial position of the municipality. The state 
requires that all local government budgets and certain 
financing and purchases be approved by state agencies. 30 
The budget review is conducted by department staff 
members (many hired short-term annually) and is made 
easier for local units of government by state-provided 
training and consistent reporting requirements. When 
these preventive actions fail to ward off systemic financial 
issues, the state begins a more involved intervention. The 
community is first placed on a watch list, at which point 
the state generally channels additional monetary aid to the 
struggling government. The state also uses its Qualified 
Bond Act Program, which requires state approval to bond or 
make capital expenditures, to ensure stability and prevent 
default. This program can capture and stall state aid for 
payment of debt services. At the same time, DLGS offers 
technical assistance to cities to help them solve underlying 
problems that contribute to fiscal distress. 

The most notable example is the consolidation of the 
Camden police force in 2010. The mayor terminated the 
entire city police force and contracted with the county 
to provide those services, with the guidance and support 


29 Until recently, when Atlantic City was declared to be in fiscal distress 
and an emergency manager was appointed. 

30 Procurements over $5 million must be reviewed by the comptroller, 
and those over $10 million must be directly approved. 



of state officials. 31 Camden illustrates the cooperative 
efforts of various levels and sectors of the state and local 
governments. It highlights that preventive efforts to 
maintain or restore fiscal sustainability are not always 
sufficient, but that a collaborative approach can assist cities 
and the state through difficult political decisions. New 
Jersey’s approach indicates that the state views itself in 
partnership with local governments, with a responsibility 
to provide a check on risky financial decisions but also 
to provide ongoing financial assistance to struggling 
communities. 

In contrast to New Jersey’s hesitance to use direct state 
control, Pennsylvania’s Act 47 allows the state to place 
fiscally distressed communities in receivership under the 
direction of the Center for Local Government Services in 
the Department of Community and Economic Development. 
Once a municipality has been placed under receivership, 
local government officials must have the majority of their 
decisions confirmed by the receiver, and the receivership 
board may implement cost-saving or revenue-raising 
strategies unavailable to local officials. The board has the 
ability to raise taxes above the legal maximum but has no 
additional powers in collective bargaining. Principally, 
the receiver acts as a liaison between the local government 
and others to improve the financial integrity of the city and 
is typically able to broker additional state funding for the 
distressed community. In Harrisburg’s recent financial 
descent, for instance, the receiver was able to facilitate $25 
million of revenue to fund a non-profit that would provide 
infrastructure and economic development. 

Receivers in Pennsylvania tend to take a comprehensive 
view of local financial difficulties as they work with the 
state to look for alternative partnerships and unique 
revenue-enhancing and cost-sharing schemes. Proposed 
financial recovery plans often include recommendations 
that will improve local governments’ economic positions 
in the future. This approach extends through the process 
of recovery. It requires more research, more interactions 
and coordination between parties, and more time to allow 
for business adjustments and industrial reorganization. 
Furthermore, it includes a period of weaning cities off the 
additional funding to which they had access during their 
most trying times. To officially exit Act 47, cities must 
follow an extensive process that includes hearings and the 
department director’s signature. As a result, Pennsylvania 
has had only seven of 28 distressed communities officially 
conclude the process. Allowing cities to remain in a 
system with additional structure and support illustrates 
Pennsylvania’s acknowledgement that factors outside of 
local control contribute to fiscal issues, and that the state 
has some role in providing additional support. 

31 Returning to the role of other state policies in distress solutions, this 
action would not have been possible without particular provisions 
within union and employee contracts that allowed for such termination 
of individual employees. 


In all, intervention policies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania 
are administered by state agencies dedicated to working 
with local governments. State personnel are involved 
with municipalities well before distress, and they have 
resources and authority to assist municipalities. Though 
administrators are afforded the statutory authority to 
assume greater control over city finances, this is not the 
only facet of their relationship with local governments. 

New York and Ohio: The Benefits of 
Monitoring 

Similar to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, New York 
has established a system that supports state and local 
cooperation and information sharing. As local fiscal 
crisis deepens, the state becomes more involved in 
local political and operational affairs. The state’s policy 
approach to local fiscal emergencies is ad hoc\ (rather 
than multijurisdictional), allowing lawmakers to survey 
the specific causes of distress for a given community and 
legislate solutions in line with these problems. 

As is well-documented, New York’s history of fiscal 
intervention begins with New York City’s near bankruptcy 
in 1975. Naturally, a crisis of that magnitude spurred state 
action, but since that time, New York has not been plagued 
by chronic distress. This is due in part to cities’ ability 
to increase revenues without legal restriction (until 2014, 
when the state imposed a cap on property tax increases). 
Additionally, many New York communities have avoided 
the economic peril that results from a loss of major 
industries and subsequent economic restructuring. 32 This 
history is evident in the state’s view of municipal distress 
as an unusual and unique instance that requires customized 
solutions. New York provides gradual intervention and 
individualized approaches to distress, with the decisions 
and the process supervised by state elected officials - the 
governor, the legislature and the comptroller. 

In addition to customized intervention approaches to 
distressed cities - which could violate the constitutions 
of states that disallow special legislation - New York is 
also heavily involved in monitoring the fiscal position of 
its local governments. The state’s Local Government and 
School Accountability (LGSA) unit of the Office of the State 
Comptroller operates the Fiscal Stress Monitoring System, 
which reviews annual financial data of local governments to 
determine whether each government is facing significant, 
moderate or probable fiscal stress. Municipalities must 
submit audit reports, which are reviewed and in some 
cases conducted by approximately 200 auditors. 33 From 
annual reports, budgets and audits, the LGSA creates 
local fiscal measures for benchmarking, trend analysis and 

32 Buffalo was an exception and did necessitate intervention proceedings. 
It should be noted that Buffalo is one of only four New York local 
governments responsible for operating its own school district. 

33 These 200 employees review audit reports of school districts and other 
local governments as well as municipalities. 



general monitoring over time and across local government 
types. State auditors are also deployed to work with local 
governments. As a result, state officials may use knowledge 
of community nuances in evaluating local deviations 
from sound fiscal indicators and state trends. Such 
specialization is particularly useful as state intervention 
becomes necessary. 34 

If a local government is identified as financially unsound, 
the state must pass special legislation to institute a local 
control board for the municipality to engage in the formal 
intervention process. After a local control board is created, 
primary authority over the struggling municipality is 
transferred from the comptroller’s office to the governor' 
appointed board. 

Each board, by the nature of the process, has different 
powers. Previous boards have overseen proposed local 
budgets and set personnel policy, and were granted the 
final authority to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 35 That 
the boards have had no additional taxing authority, ability 
to renegotiate previous collective bargaining agreements 
nor authority to make unilateral budget decisions reflects 
the state’s emphasis on local autonomy. 

The boards have been particularly useful in coordinating 
intergovernmental solutions. For instance, the Buffalo 
Fiscal Stability Authority (BFSA) was established in 2003. 

It helped Buffalo manage its additional school district 
responsibility and restructured the city’s pension and 
health insurance plans by joining the respective state- 
level systems. Finally, the BFSA brokered an arrangement 
for city parks to be managed at the county level and for 
16 libraries to close. Despite the local knowledge and 
intergovernmental efforts, it took nearly nine years for 
Buffalo to exit receivership and for the BFSA to transition 
into an advisory role. Policy specifies that the BFSA will 
serve in this role until 2037, and the city may revert to full 
receivership if financial indicators show distress. 

At the state level, New York vests its relationship with 
local governments and the power to intervene in elected 
officials - the governor, the comptroller and the legislature. 
This separates the state’s ongoing monitoring from its 
intervention, and though it raises the legislative barrier 
to intervention by requiring the crafting and passage of 
legislation, it also provides public accountability and a 
system of checks and balances. The ability to draft city- 
specific solutions allows New York to address management 
issues, economic conditions and the impacts of the state 

34 Ultimately, any distressed community implements solutions that are 
specific to its condition. A universal policy prescription is to reduce 
expenditures. However, no universal prescription can be made 

on what account specifically should be limited and in what way. 
Knowledge of exact inefficiencies, redundancies, slack and so forth is 
necessary to act. If outside agents are to advise on such actions, their 
already having some knowledge of the particulars of the city will allow 
for more expedient and implementable recommendations. 

35 Control boards are not granted this authority for New York City.

context in different ways in each city, ideally assisting the 
community to long-term stability. 

Ohio, like New York, faced a fiscal crisis in its largest city 
in the 1970s. Cleveland’s default on short-term notes in 
1978, which made it the first municipality to default since 
the Great Depression, led Ohio to develop a comprehensive 
policy designed to prevent and, if necessary, intervene 
in distressed cities (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2013; Levine, 
Scorsone and Justice, 2013). No municipality has defaulted 
since Cleveland, but Toledo, East Cleveland and other 
municipalities have entered fiscal emergency status, 
particularly once the Great Recession exacerbated declining 
revenue bases and expenditure pressures. 

Ohio’s Local Government Services Division, located in the 
state auditor’s office, is responsible for training local officials 
and auditing local budgets. Chapter 118 of the state code, 36 
which deals with local fiscal emergencies, grants the Local 
Government Services Division (the auditor) responsibility 
for categorizing distressed communities for fiscal caution, 
fiscal watch or fiscal emergency. The categorization system 
signals to local officials, bondholders and other stakeholders 
the extent of the local government’s fiscal stress and the 
ease of financial recovery anticipated. It serves as a useful 
continuum of distress, recognizing that failing to pass one 
indicator of financial soundness may not require the same 
actions as a community failing multiple triggers. Each category 
has an increasing level of oversight (i.e., requirements for audit 
depth and financial plan proposals). Once fiscal emergency is 
declared, an advisory board is created. 

Under all three distress categories, local governments are 
required to submit recovery plans to the Local Government 
Services Division. If a local government is not compliant 
with its recovery plan, the only penalty is movement 
to a higher designation of fiscal distress. It is not until 
a municipality reaches the fiscal emergency status that 
penalties are imposed. 

As part of the fiscal emergency proceedings, municipal 
officials must submit a recovery plan to the recovery 
board for approval. If a plan is not submitted or the local 
government fails to adhere to a plan, the Office of Budget 
and Management is supposed to suspend all state funding 
to that municipality, 37 though this penalty has never been 
fully enforced. 

36 The other elements comprising the law became effective, were revised 
or added in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2002 - http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/118 
(pdf). The state’s approach is consistent with the autonomy allowed 
Ohio’s local governments. Section 118.02 (B) of the state code states 
that, “[t]he intention...is to enact procedures, provide powers, and 
impose restrictions ...while leaving principal responsibility for the 
conduct of the affairs...in the charge of its duly elected officials.” The 
effort to maintain local autonomy is demonstrated by the fact that the 
review process of the Local Government Services Division is initiated 
by request of local officials as well as at the suggestion of auditors. 

37 Although individuals receiving direct state welfare within the 
community’s borders continue to do so. 




Ohio, like other states, struggles with assisting 
communities to achieve permanent fiscal stability. The city 
of East Cleveland was under fiscal emergency for 18 years. 
Exiting the process failed to mark long-term sustainable 
success - East Cleveland was once again placed under 
fiscal emergency. In late 2014, it was considering entering 
into bankruptcy proceedings, 38 and the city’s mayor filed a 
petition seeking a merger with the city of Cleveland in the 
summer of 2015. 39

Ohio, like Michigan, illustrates the issues that arise when 
a state’s solution (intervention policy) does not match the 
causes of distress (context). Local officials retain control of 
decision making and the plan to resolve distress, but they 
and the state agency responsible for intervention lack the 
authority or resources to address the root causes of distress 
or to circumvent the pressures that the mix of state policies 
adds to local fiscal policymaking processes.

Section 3: Conclusions and 
Recommendations 


In the previous sections we identified the ways that broad 
state policies limit or enhance the local governing options 
and the ways that states with intervention policies match 
their approach to local financial distress with the reality 
of city operating environments. Here we conclude our 
analysis with conclusions and practical recommendations 
to assist the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
approach to local fiscal crises. 

CIIJ Conciysions 

There is no single model policy for state intervention 
in distressed cities or for prevention of fiscal distress. 
Changing Michigan’s fiscal intervention law to replicate 
that of another state would likely provide little 
improvement for Flint or other cities facing fiscal crises. 
There is no “best practice” for state intervention in cities. 
What Michigan can learn from other states and our research 
is that removing and repairing mismanagement addresses 
only one cause of fiscal distress. Bringing a structurally 
imbalanced budget back into balance is an important step 
to assist cities like Flint, but a policy that does not address 
a state’s unique system of revenue, tax and expenditures, 
and labor policies may not help cities truly escape financial 
trouble over the long term. States must decide which legal 
and political tradeoffs they are willing to make to support 
city fiscal health. Michigan must also recognize that, in 
comparison with similar states, it provides a particularly 
difficult environment for its cities. 

Municipal fiscal distress is not just a local problem. State 
policy choices set the boundaries for local action and the 
conditions under which cities receive assistance. It is not 
surprising that these conclusions do not point to simple 
solutions, executable at the local level. Changing any one 
part of the state context is politically challenging, and it 
would be impractical to recommend major policy overhauls 
of Proposal A, the Headlee Amendment, collective 
bargaining rules and state revenue sharing. Ideally, 
Michigan would adopt a more balanced approach to its 
local governments’ fiscal needs, but we are aware that this 
is unlikely in the short term because of both political will 
and the high barriers to changing constitutionally enshrined 
rules. Instead, we offer recommendations that balance 
improvements that would better support cities in fiscal 
distress with political feasibility. 

Mec@mmenoaii©iis 

Create a state agency that coordinates services to local 
governments and offers technical support and fiscal 


monitoring. Establishing a formal place within state 
government that is responsible for ongoing, cooperative 
work with local governments on fiscal stability and other 
issues would help create a partnership and culture of trust 
between the state and its municipalities. The Department 
of Treasury does provide some of these services on an 
individual basis via the Office of Fiscal Responsibility 
(OFR), but the OFR does not have the resources necessary 
to provide a comprehensive system of support to all of the 
state’s local governments. 

It is important that whatever agency is created be 
empowered with human resources to sufficiently provide 
service; financial resources, separate from the state’s 
revenue sharing to local governments, to offer special 
assistance where needed to communities facing challenges 
or distress; and a position within the state departmental 
structure that allows it to be taken seriously when 
recommending policy and working with other departments 
to assist local governments. The examples of offices in 
the other states in our study may provide elements of 
the agency’s design, but the office should be built with 
Michigan’s particular context and culture in mind. It may 
be appropriate to expand the OFR in its current position, 
but moving the office to another department, establishing 
it as a stand-alone agency and other potential structures 
should be evaluated as well. 

Raise awareness among citizens and state decision makers 
that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at the local 
level. Flint is an example that can illustrate this point as 
the C.S. Mott Foundation and city leaders communicate 
with the public and state officials. As the city emerges from 
state control, the budget is balanced for the short term, 
and the transition advisory board is in place to monitor 
management and compliance with the plan. Yet revenue 
projections show the city likely facing a structural deficit 
in the next five years with little available to cut from the 
budget. State control has reasonably removed management 
problems as the cause of deficits, yet the city’s fiscal 
health remains precarious. A focused communications 
effort highlighting the combined effects of Michigan’s 
expenditure, revenue and labor policies could help broaden 
the discussion of fiscal distress in the state and create 
awareness that this is more than a local problem. Rather 
than being the exception, Flint may be the harbinger of 
what is to come for Michigan’s local governments without 
changes at the state level.

Strong. The collective bargaining strength 
of local police, local fire fighters, teach- 
ers, and "other’' local employees - the 
four mam functional areas of local public 
employment - are measured along three 
dimensions: (1) collective bargaining rights 
for local public employees, ranging from 
! "Duty to Bargain” to "Collective Bargaining 
Is Prohibited"; (2) Union Security Provisions 
via the existence of a Right-to-Work Law 
for local public employees; and (3) Strike 
Policy Provisions.

We invited three types of individuals to participate in the Workshop on State Intervention in Distressed 
Communities held at Detroit’s Grccktown Hotel and Casino October 16-17, 2014: individuals who were for- 
mally involved in various elements of state intervention policy design and implementation, those involved 
in local fiscal distress and bankruptcy from a legal standpoint, and policy experts and researchers. The 
following table classifies the participants.

A Deep Dive Into State Intervention: 

A Structured dialogue about the participants’ experiences 
with key elements of state intervention. 

• Stage 1: Getting in 

Where and when is pre-intervention support of- 
fered? How are distressed localities identified? 
When and how do local governments enter the 
prog ra m| : How are deci $i o n c ri te ria a p p 1 i ed ? 

• Stage 2: Developing a plan 

Policies on Paper v. ; Po 1 i c ies i n P rac- 
tice 

♦ 

Who carries out the intervention? What actions 
may these actors take? What are the specific goals 
of intervention? What are the chief barriers to ef- 
fective implementation? 

Stage 5: Exit strategy 

How does a local government exit the program? 
Are triggers weii specified? When, if ever, are 
medium- and long-term fiscal, economic, or ser- 
vice-based objectives discussed?

Introduction 


The city of Flint, Michigan, has experienced a variety of fiscal 
difficulties since the early 2000s. In. 2002, an emergency 
financial manager was appointed for the city under Public 
Act 72 of 1990 and was in place until 2004. Unfortunately, 
the reforms and changes made at that time only lasted for 
a few years before fiscal problems re-emerged in Flint (see 
MSU Extension, white paper Long-Term Crisis and Systemic Failure: 
Taking the Fiscal Stress of America’s Older Cities Seriously). By 2011, 
a second wave of emergency managers would be named to 
run the city under two newer laws (including PA 4 of 2011 
and PA 436 of 2012). These emergency managers were 
removed from the city, restoring home rule in April 2015. The 
key question; Can Flint avoid the problems that have plagued 
it for the last 15 years without being placed under state 
control for the third time? Before answering that question, we 
must understand the reforms and changes that have occurred 
in the city since a fiscal emergency' was declared in 2011. 


The objectives of this case study of Flint, Michigan., are 
to understand the economic and fiscal trends that led to 
the state takeover via an emergency financial manager in. 
November 2011 and to analyze the impact of the emergency 
manager policy on the city’s fiscal health. It updates trends 
presented in a previous case study on. fiscal stress in Flint, 3 
provides additional detail regarding the policy changes that 
emergency managers have made, and examines the impacts 
of those changes.

II. Historical Overview of Flint, Michigan 


Examining the history of Flint can provide an. 
understanding of the evolution of the chronic fiscal stress 
that has plagued the. city, as well as its significance in the 
geographic region. The city of Flint is located in Genesee 
County, about 60 miles northwest of Detroit. The Flint 
River provided the natural, resources to create successful 
commerce in the 1800s for fur trading, the lumber industry, 
the manufacture of carriages, and eventually the production 
of horseless carriages that led to the birth of the automotive 
industry. The entrepreneurial spirit and wealth in the area 
contributed to the founding of the Buick Motor Company 
in .1903, followed by the incorporation of General Motors 
(GM) in 1908. With the rapid growth of the automotive 
industry came concerns for employee working conditions. 
This led to the first automotive sit-down strike in 1936-1937 
in Flint. After 44 days, the strike ended with the first union 
agreement with GM, which gave rise to the United. Auto 
Workers (UAW). The continued improvements in working 
conditions and wages enabled Flint to become an ideal 
place to live and work, and the increase in wealth fostered 
a well-respected educational system. Early automotive 
industry leaders such as Charles Stewart Mott and William 
C. Durant provided the vision to create a strong cultural 
environment. Flint prospered for most of the years from 
the 1930s into the early 1970s. Like many industrial cities, 
however, the economic vibrancy ebbed and flowed with 
the U.S. automotive industry. In 1978, GM employed 


over 80,000 Flint-area residents. By 1990, the number of 
employees decreased to 23,000, dipping to as low as 8,000 
in 2006.

The City of Flint was incorporated in 1855. The present 
charter, adopted in 1974, provides for a strong mayor- 
council form of government. The city council consists of 
nine members, each representing a ward and serving four- 
year terms. The mayor, also elected to a four-year term, 
is the chief executive officer. The mayor appoints a city 
administrator, as well as principal officials and department 
heads. 

The City' of Flint: provides a full range of services across 
32.8 square miles, including: police and fire protection, 
construction and maintenance of streets and infrastructure, 
recreational and cultural activities, water and sewer 
services, and sanitation and garbage pickup services. In 
addition, the City of Flint is financially accountable for four 
other entities: 

► City of Flint Board of Hospital Managers (manages and 
operates the Hurley Medical. Center providing inpatient, 
outpatient, and emergency care) 

> Flint Downtown Development Authority (promotes 
rehabilitation of the downtown area) 


Z 



> City of Flint Economic Development Corporation (provides financing and 
development opportunities for businesses located in the City) 

* Flint Area Enterprise Community 4 5 (coordinates the federal enterprise and 
helps to leverage the resources for the zone) 

Flint is the county seat for Genesee County. Like most counties in Michigan, the 
county government provides court services, human services, record keeping, and 
community enrichment for its residents. The. county and its elected officials also 
serve as regional problem solvers. 

Diimofgifiipliiss 

The city of Flint’s population has changed drastically over the past 50 years. 

This section explores the historical changes that have occurred throughout the 
city and region. These trends are essential for explaining the path that has led to 
Flint’s fiscal distress and may point to the path that the city may need to follow 
in order to build a sustainable future. 


According to data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the 
city of Flint has declined over five consecutive decades. There were 48% fewer 
residents in the city in 2010 compared to 1960 (Exhibit 11-1). In 2012, there were 
100,515 s residents in the city; in 2013 the city’s estimated population further 
declined to 99,758 6 . 

In contrast, the population trends in the Flint metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA), defined by Genesee County boundaries, indicate enormous growth 
through, the 1970s with slight declines over the following three decades. This 
indicates that the Flint metropolitan statistical area has experienced significant: 
decentralization.

Exhibit U-2 more clearly illustrates this decentralization. In 1940, the city of 
Flint comprised 66% of the population of the Flint MSA population compared 
to only 24% in 20.13. The estimates from the 20B American Community Survey 
indicate that the net migration into the suburbs may be starting to stabilize, 
though Flint’s population has continued to decline in recent years.

To see this more clearly, Exhibit H-4 shows the relative share of each age 
category in the total population for each year. The share of population aged 19 
years old and under generally increased from .1.940 to 1970 with the Baby Boom 
and has since continually declined from its peak of 41% in 1970. to only 29% of 
the population in 2013. The share of individuals aged 20 to 34 has fluctuated over 
the last seven decades, but has been on a general decline since 1980. The share 
of population aged 35 to 64 years old experienced a period of contraction from 
1950 to 1980 followed by a continuous period of growth since then, likely due to 
the aging of the Baby Boomer population. Finally, during the past, seven decades, 
there, has been a fairly steady expansion of residents aged 65 and. over, probably 
due to increased life expectancy. This demographic is expected to continue to 
expand with the aging of the Baby Boomer population. 

The racial distribution of the city has also changed since the 1940s, as shown in 
Exhibit iI-5. The city has become more diverse with a population that is 39% 
white and 56% bl a ck/A fri ca r; -Am erican in 2012 compared to 95.6% white and 
4% black/African-American in 1940. The share of the population in the “Other” 
category, which includes both individuals of other races and multi-racial 
individuals, has also grown from 0.1% in 1940 to 6% in 2010.

Housing trends also help tell the story of a city that is facing fiscal stress. The 
rate, of housing vacancy increased from 5.1% in 1970 to 25.4 % in 2013 (Exhibit 
11-8). The rate of change in vacancy was highest between 2000 and 2013 with 
a 13 percentage-point increase. This coincides with Michigan’s decade of 
economic decline. The potential impact of increased housing vacancies on fiscal 
health include not only decline in property values and associated property 
tax revenues, but also increased municipal maintenance, police patrol, fire 
protection, and other costs to address health and human safety concerns.' 

Home ownership is also associated with the strength of a community’s property 
values. In 2013, owner-occupied housing only comprised 57% of occupied 
housing units compared to 73% of units at its peak over the last seven decades 
in 1960. However, the rate of owner-occupied housing in 2013 is a slight increase 
from its value in 2010, perhaps a small sign of recovery for the city of Flint 
(Exhibit 81-7).

Given these trends, it is no surprise that property values in the Flint area have 
declined drastically since the Great Recession as shown in Exhibit US. The 
state equalized value (SEV) and the taxable value (TV) have almost converged as 
of 2015. This could be attributed to a combination of falling property values and 
the “pop-up” effect of the transfer of ownership of property due to Proposal A 
(which will be discussed in more detail in section IV). Since local governments 
tend to rely heavily on property taxes for revenue, this is another indicator of the 
declining tax base of the city. 


The trends in the jobless rate in the city of Flint and Flint MSA tend to follow 
the same pattern as that of Michigan as a whole (Exhibit Ii-9). The jobless rate 
rose during the 2001 recession and did not see sustained recovery until after the 
Great Recession ended in 2009; however, absolute unemployment rates tend to 
be higher in the city compared to the MSA and the state as a whole. While there 
has been a drop in unemployment in the city of Flint since the end of the Great 
Recession, it is still higher (14% in 2014) than pre-2001 recession levels (8% in 
2000 ).

The city of Flint’s audit reports disclosed the city’s personal income statistics 
as shown in Exhibit li-10. While a slight recovery occurred after the 2001 
recession, in general, personal income has been on a long-term decline since 
1996, indicating a diminishing tax base. A decline in personal income not only 
indicates a lower capacity for property tax and income tax. revenues, but also 
suggests a relation to a lower demand for business-type services. If this demand 
is fairly elastic with respect to personal income, this would lead to a reduction in 
city income from public recreation programs, parking fees, and similar sources. 
The decline in personal income began leveling off in 2009, suggesting signs of 
stabilization following Michigan’s decade in recession. 

While the economic climate in the 1990s and 2000s worsened the city of Flint’s 
employment: and income trends, many decades of above average poverty rates 
signal long-term fiscal stress. Exhibit 18-11 shows the general growth in the 
share of total population living below the poverty level, which peaked at 41.2% 
in 2010. The share of families below the poverty level follows the population 
trend. Poverty rates reported by the 2012 American Community Survey indicate

a possible improvement since 2010, which also coincides with the improvements 
in unemployment; and income, discussed above. If the unemployment 
and income trends are indeed indicative of economic recovery, then these 
improvements in poverty statistics are possibly explained by a countercyclical, 
relationship between poverty and the business cycle. 

Exhibit I M2 depicts the cumulative change in the number of nonfarm, jobs 
in the city of Flint, the Flint: MSA, and Michigan as a whole. While the state 
overall saw a period of growth in employment in the mid-1990s, employment 
in the city of Flint and the Flint: MSA began to decline in 1996. According to 
annual estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the Flint MSA., the 
decline in manufacturing was the driving force of unemployment. Employment 
in dais sector consistently fell between 1995 and 2008, from 48,200 jobs to 
9,500/ Over this same period, the share, of manufacturing jobs (of total nonfarm 
employment) dropped from 27% to 9%. This trend is likely due to the region’s 
reliance on the domestic auto industry and the declines in the Big Three’s 
market share that began in the 1980s and led to plant closures in the 1990s and 
early 2000s. According to Genesee County’s audit reports, the county’s largest 
employer in FY.1997 was GM with 40,944 employees. In FY2009, GM still held 
its rank as the county’s largest employer, but with only 3,417 employees in the 
county. 

While the Flint MSA saw a boost in jobs in 2000, the city experienced a long- 
term decline in employment over the period shown, with 39% fewer jobs in 
2014 than existed in 1995. The share of employment in the city compared to the 
MSA as a whole also fell in the same time period; as of 20.1.4, employees in Flint 
represent about 18% of those in the Flint: MSA compared to 26% in 1995. 

The trends in Exhibit li~12 indicate that employment started to recover 
slightly in 20,10. This has been primarily driven by the private sector, namely the 
manufacturing, professional and business services, and trade, transportation 
and utilities sub-sectors. Public sector employment in the region has followed 
national trends as It continues to decline. The overall rise in employment in Flint 
along with the unemployment, income, and poverty trends support the story 
that the city is experiencing signs of economic, recovery.

The industries representing the city’s 10 largest employers have diversified over 
the past decade. Most notable is the increased prevalence of higher education 
and employment services (Exhibit 0-13), During periods of economic decline, 
enrollment: in higher education often increases as individuals seek to expand 
their skill sets or pursue career changes. Demand for job placement services 
also increases. Another trend is the increasing concentration of employees in 
the top 10 employers. The 10 largest employers represented about 65% of the 
total number of employees in 2014 compared to only 59% of the total number 
of employees in 2003. This indicates that the impact of smaller firms in the city 
has diminished over this period. Larger firms tend to have more organizational 
slack, 11 which can act as a buffer during economic downturns. Smaller firms 
that; do not have such slack are likely more vulnerable to poor economic 
environments. Depending on the nature of recovery, employment in small firms 
could diminish even further during future recessions. 

Exhibit ii-14 illustrates the diversification of employment in the city of Flint by 
comparing the share of employees in each industry in 2003 and 2014. The relative 
share of both, automotive employment atid public sector employment dropped 
more significantly than that of healthcare employment.

The city has concentrated efforts to encourage new development. Although most 
new projects include property that is either tax exempt or requires a property 
tax incentive, they have brought employees to the city, which increases the 
nonresident income tax revenue. Recent redevelopment efforts have focused 
on marketing the 452-3 ere vacant “Buick City” property. The Environmental 
Protection Agency has committed up to $7 million for Phase I clean-up of that 
property.™ The total commitment to Buick City is approximately $30 million. 
Funding for the remediation is from the Revitalizing Auto Communities 
Environmental Response (RACER) Trust that wws created through the GM 
bankruptcy. The soil remediation project began in early 2011. According to the 
March 2014 update, corrective measures are being implemented in the Southend 
site. A corrective measures proposal for the Northend cleanup is being reviewed 
and will be presented to the public in summer 20142' 

In November 2013, the American Cast Iron Pipe Company announced plans to 
construct a plant on the Buick City property, creating 50 to 60 manufacturing 
jobs for Flint. The plant opened in December 2014. 

Flint’s air transportation needs are serviced by nearby Bishop International 
Airport, in January 2011, the Bishop Airport Board approved the bid process for 
a $16.8 million expansion. v This project added 47,000 square feet of terminal 
space, four gates and doubled the width of the corridor linking two sections of 
the airport. The expansion was completed in November 2012, adding 350 jobs 
and increasing the number of passengers at Flint’s Bishop International Airport”’ 1 . 
Several highways meet road transportation needs.

Due to its decreasing population, employment, and tax 
revenues, the Flint city government has been under 
considerable fiscal stress in recent years. In the early 2000s, 
an. emergency financial manager (EFM) was appointed for 
the city, and was in place until 2004; however, the city soon 
returned to fiscal insolvency. 

The cycle of returning to a deficit position after an EFM 
appointment ends is not unique to Flint. Drawing on the 
experience of Flint and other cities that have been assigned 
an EFM, state policy makers drafted revisions to PA 72, 
which was replaced by PA 4 in 2011. After a referendum, PA 
4 was repealed in. 2012, then replaced by PA 436 of 2012 s . 

The new law provides greater incentive and mechanisms 
for local governments to address budget challenges before 
an emergency manager (EM) is assigned. PA 436 also 
provides four options to struggling municipalities 9 , offering 
alternatives to the appointment of an EM. Ultimately, 
however, if cities with chronic fiscal stress are. suffering 
from structural challenges beyond their control, improved 
management will only be able to cure a limited number of 
problems. 

If a city is placed in receivership under PA 436 of 2012 
and an EM is appointed by the state, he or she is granted 
broad, powers to address the struggling city’s finances. 

This includes the authority to amend collective bargaining 
agreements, make personnel changes, and review 7 and 
approve the city’s budget. 

Responding to the most recent fiscal crisis, Michigan’s 
Treasury Department conducted, a preliminary review of 
Flint’s financial, situation in August and September 2011. 

™ The review found that general fund expenditures had 
exceeded revenues for the preceding four years. Two years 
after its deficit reduction plan had been submitted to the 
state, the general fund deficit had more than doubled. The 
review also reported that departments within the municipal 
government had been compensating for cash shortages by 
borrowing from other funds. The review 7 team determined 


8 Emergency financial managers were in place, under Act 72; the. term 
“emergency manager” is used in PA 4 and PA 436. There, are somewhat 
different powers under the various acts but otherwise the. concept is the 
same. 

8 These options include entering into a consent, agreement, with the 
state, filing for bankruptcy, agreeing to mediation, or accepting the 
appointment of an EM. 


it was uncertain whether the City of Flint would be able to 
fulfill its short-term financial obligations. 

Due to the City of Flint’s structural deficit, increasing 
legacy costs, and accumulating debt, the review 7 team, 
recommended to the governor that the city be. placed under 
emergency financial, management under Public Act 4. In 
November 2011, the governor of Michigan placed, the City of 
Flint in receivership. 

Michael Brown was appointed as the city’s emergency 
financial manager effective December 1, 2011. In August 
2012, Michael Brown w 7 as replaced by Edward Kurtz as 
emergency manager (who had served as the city’s EM from 
2002 to 2004). Ed Kurtz served as the city’s emergency 
manager until July 2013, at which time Michael Brow r n was 
again appointed by the governor. Michael Brown resigned 
in September 2013; Darnell Earley w 7 as appointed as his 
replacement. In January 2015, it was announced that. Jerry 
Ambrose, w 7 ho had previously served as the. city’s finance 
and administration director, would replace Darnell Earley 
as emergency manager. Jerry Ambrose, served as the city’s 
EM until April. 20.15, when control of the city’s finances 
was returned to the mayor and city council under the 
supervision of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. 

Reforms to Personnel Costs 

Wages and Salaries 

Significant actions w 7 ere taken shortly after Michael Brown’s 
appointment as emergency manager. Almost immediately 
after his appointment, the salaries, benefits, and other 
compensation were eliminated for the city’s mayor and 
nine council, members. The mayor’s salary was later 
restored to 60% of his base salary with full restoration of 
his benefits, and. the salaries of city council members were 
restored to $7,000 per year with no benefits. Additionally, 
council members were required to complete level one of the 
Michigan Municipal League’s core courses for municipal 
government. Several positions were eliminated, which 
included the Office of the Ombudsman, the Civil Service 
Commission, and the respective staff assigned, to these 
offices. 


13 




In an effort to reduce the city government’s wage expenses 
by 20%™, significant changes were made to the collective 
bargaining agreements of the City of Flints’s police and fire 
unions. Wages were reduced, across the board, for members 
of all police unions: by 1.5% for sergeants, by 2.5% for 
captains and lieutenants, and by 5% for officers). Salaries 
and wages of members of the firefighters’ union were also 
reduced 10 . 

Substantial changes were also made to the city government 
contracts with the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) locals 1600 and 
1799, the unions representing the majority of general city 
government employees. Wages for Local 1600 members 
were reduced by 2.5%, and several changes to overtime, 
holiday, and leave pay were made for both unions. 

With the. exception of emergency overtime, the EM required 
that all employee overtime be approved in. advance. 
Executive orders were also issued to put limitations on 
departments’ spending authority, with EM approval 
required, for purchases over $10,000. Stringent budgetary 
guidelines were put. on all departments, emphasizing that 
budgetary authority is not a mandate to spend and that 
actions to keep expenses low should be taken whenever 
possible. 

Pensions 

Changes were made to police and. fire unions’ pension 
eligibility. Employees’ annual pension, contributions were 
increased to 9,5% of all earnings for those in the fire and 
police unions. For members of the unions hired prior to the 
introduction of the new pension guidelines, the portion 
of pensions earned up to the 20th year of service are 
calculated according to the expired bargaining agreement. 
However, the multiplier was reduced to 2.25 and capped at 
240 hours of leave time included as part of the. final average 
compensation (FAC) for all service time earned after the 
effective dates of the new collective bargaining agreements. 

Similar adjustments w T ere made to the pension benefits 
for locals 1600 and 1799. The defined benefit multiplier 
was reduced to 1.5% prospectively, and the employee 
contribution rate was increased from 8% to 12% for Local 
1600 and to 9.5% for Local 1799. Hybrid retirement plans 
(with both defined contribution and defined benefit 
components) were established for new hires and former 
defined, benefit plan participants. Employees’ contributions 
to the defined contribution components are matched by the 
City of Flint; employer contributions to the defined benefit 
component were capped at 10%. 


® From $63,080.16 to $50,791.52 for CAD supervisors, from. $60,515.52 
to $56,998.24 for quartermaster, and from $33,467.20 to $27,270.88 for 
comm, specialist trainees 


To save administration-related costs, pensions for all unions 
with collective bargaining agreements with the City of Flint 
were transferred from the Flint Employees’ Retirement 
System (FER.S) to the Michigan Municipal Employees 
Retirement System (MERS).“ This move was approved by 
all but the police officers’ union; section 19(k) of PA 4 was 
invoked to approve the transfer of Flint police officers’ 
pensions. 

Other Post-Employment Benefits 

Changes were made to the healthcare benefits received 
by retirees of the police and fire, unions. Cuts included 
discontinuing healthcare, for a former employees’ spouse if 
he or she is eligible to receive paid health coverage through 
an employer or former employer. The City or Flint reduced 
the number of plans offered to employees hired after July 
.1, 2012, offering a high deductible plan in conjunction, with 
a health savings account. Through executive orders, the 
EM reserved the right of the city to change or discontinue 
the health insurance programs in response to the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPA.CA.) as amended. 

The City of Flint scaled back its contribution requirements 
for an active employee’s health coverage, requiring 
employees to pay any premium contributions that exceed 
the amount contributed by the employer through pension 
deductions. 

Retirees and their spouses aged 65 and over who are 
covered by Medicare supplemental plan at. the employer’s 
expense are. subject to contribution limits of the Publicly- 
Funded Health Insurance Contribution. Act. (PA .152 of 2012) 
if and. only if the retiree enrolls in and pays for Medicare 
Supplemental Part R. Changes made to the healthcare 
coverage of retired members of the local 1600 and 1799 
unions were similar to those of the other major unions 
representing City of Flint employees. 

Changes were made to the retiree health benefits offered 
to personnel hired after the effective dates of the new 
agreements. Instead of employer -paid retiree healthcare 
coverage, members of the police officers’ and firefighters’ 
unions, as well as locals 1.600 and 1799 hired after April 20.1.2 
were, eligible for Retiree Medical Savings Accounts (RMS As) 
to which the City of Flint and employees contribute 
through payroll deductions. 

Under the executive orders, the City of Flint committed 
to contribute $1,500 annually to the RMSAs, with 
employees contributing $600 per year. Employees will, be 
100% vested at all times on their own contributions and 
investment earnings, while employer contributions and 
investment earnings will be 100% vested after five years of 
completed service. The same changes were made to retiree 
health benefits of newly hired nonunion city government 


employees. Contributions to a new employee’s RMSA 
continue until the employee is no longer employed by the 
City of Flint (including retirement) or when the employee 
becomes eligible for Medicare. These benefits were not 
made available to nonunion retirees or spouses who are 
eligible for health coverage through another employer or 
former employer. 

Other Reforms 

In addition to actions taken to reduce the City of Flint’s 
financial obligations in relation to staff, other measures 
were taken to address the growing deficit. User fees were 
implemented for waste collection and a special assessment 
was levied, to provide funds for the. operation of street 
lighting (to eliminate $2.85 million in costs to the city 
government’s general fund x ). Both fees were added to 


homeowners’ property tax bills. Water and sewer rates 
were increased by 25% to adequately cover the. costs of 
operating both systems. 

The City of Flint’s Fiscal. Year 2013 budget, passed by an 
executive order on April 24, 2012, was the first balanced 
budget it had passed in seven years. A. total, of 155 positions 
(16% of the workforce) were eliminated.” 

Property taxes were increased in order to support: police 
and fire budgets. This increase was achieved by a vote of 
the. city’s residents, who approved a 6 mill property tax

the city government to maintain staffing levels in the police 
and fire departments that, had, up until that point, been 
supported through a federal grant. 



IV. City Finances 

Repeated periods of governmental fund deficits can be used to identify cities 
with chronic fiscal stress. If a city is consistently unable to sustain a positive 
fund balance, it is likely facing structural budgetary constraints. The City of 
Flint’s fund balance/accumulated deficit history highlights its recurring deficits 
(Exhibit i¥-1). Temporary solutions provided some periods of short-term relief 
in 2005 to 2007 due to the measures taken by an emergency financial manager 
under Public Act 72 of 1990. The governor appointed the EFM in May 2002, who 
remained in place until 2004. The progress made during the EFM’s tenure was 
undone three years later due to subsequent labor settlements, costly litigation, 
and declining revenues. The City of Flint closed FY2G08 with a deficit in the 
General Fund of $6.8 million. Since 2010, the Flint city government has been able 
to build up the fund balances in its other governmental funds, but has mixed 
performance in controlling the deficit in its General Fund, which is the main, 
fund for general operating expenses. 

'WW’S B'feS’R 9W8B 8 sxvsS Bwh 

As of June 30, 2014, the City of Flint’s General Fund ended the year with an 
accumulated deficit of $8.9 million. This is the seventh consecutive year that the 
fund balance has been in a deficit position, but significantly reduced from the 
$19.1 million deficit in FY2012. FY2014 is also the third year since FY2006 that the 
city operated, with a surplus in its General Fund; the only other year in which the 
General Fund ended with a surplus is FY2011 (Exhibit 8Y~2).

Revenues 

As of 2014, the four primary sources of revenue, and their proportionate share 
of the General Fund, are property tax (10%), income tax (24%), state shared 
revenue (32%), and charges for services (18%). Exhibit i¥-3 shows the changes 
in the share of General Fund revenues over time. Typically, the property tax 
is the primary source of revenue for local governments. However, the City of 
Flint's reliance on the property tax has severely diminished over the last several 
years, which is a testament to the impact of falling property values in the city. 
Conversely, the share of revenues from charges for services has seen an overall 
growth. In. FY2010, the share or revenues from charges for services actually 
exceeded that: from property taxes. Both the share of revenues of income taxes 
and of state shared revenue have also declined, but to a lesser extent. The 
spike in the share of “Other” revenue funds in FY2011 was due to an $8 million 
debt issuance in the form, of 25-year fiscal stabilization bonds from the Local 
Government Loan Program through the Michigan Department of Treasury. This 
was less than, half of the $20 million in bonds that the City of Flint had initially- 
requested in order maintain operations when it had anticipated, that it would 
run. out of cash by March 1, 20,1.1. 


Property Tax 

Property tax in Michigan is assessed on both real and personal property, though 
municipalities are limited in levying property taxes in. a number of ways. First, 
the Home Rule City Act of 1909 limits cities in Michigan to levying property 
taxes of no more than. 20 mills for direct municipal services.™ Next, the Headlee 
Amendment, ratified in. 1978, limits the authorized millage rate when property 
values rise at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. xiv Increases in property values 
due to improvements or new construction are not subject to this limit. Finally, 
in 1994, Michigan voters approved Proposal A, which limited annual increases to 
the taxable value to 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, until there is 
a transfer of ownership.”

Compared to the 10 most populated local units in Genesee County, which 
represent 72% of the population, the city of Flint levies the highest homestead 
tax rate (Exhibit !¥~4). This may cause the city to be less competitive in 
attracting residents, which hinders its ability to increase its tax base. High 
tax rates also create incentives for residents to relocate to the suburban areas, 
which may be one factor that contributes to the population decentralization 
trends shown in Exhibit II~2. For example, a homeowner in the city of Flint 
will pay, on average, 37.7% more in property taxes than residents of the nine 
other largest communities that own properties with the same taxable value. 

This is a substantial increase compared, to the same analysis that was performed, 
in the 2011 case study; in FY20I1, a homeowner in Flint would pay on average 
28.2% more than a homeowner in the other nine communities with, a property 
that had the same taxable value. If a residential property has a taxable value of 
$75,000, the homeowner in Flint will pay $4,413. A homeowner in the next: most- 
populated community. Grand Blanc Charter Township, will pay $3,119.

Although the nonhomestead property tax rate had been fairly stable from 2000 
to 2010, a more noticeable increase has occurred over the last few years (Exhibit 
i V-S). In 2013, the direct city millage increased from 16.1 to 19.1 mills with the 
addition of the 6 mill public safety millage and an elimination of a 3 mill waste 
collection millage. 

As discussed in section II, property values in Flint have dramatically declined 
over the past four years. Exhibit SY-S shows a corresponding reduction in 
property tax revenues; receipts from property taxes in FY2014 were less than half 
those in FY2006, and less than 40% of their peak in FY2008. The deterioration 
of the property tax as a stable revenue source is especially clear given that less 
than 10% of General Fund revenues are dependent on property taxes in FY2014 
compared to more than 18% five years prior.

Of the 10 largest cities in Michigan, three are authorized to levy an income tax, 
including Flint. The Income tax rate is 1% for city residents and 0.5% for non- 
residents. Income tax receipts steadily declined from FY2006 to FY20.10 (Exhibit 
1 V~7). Since FY2010, this revenue stream has stabilized and seen some slight 
growth, though it fell again in FY2014. 


State shared revenue is generated from, a statewide sales tax. Revenue sharing to 
local governments consists of both constitutional and statutory payments. The 
constitutional portion is distributed on a population basis. The statutory portion 
of revenue sharing is defined by a formula based on a combination of population, 
taxable value per capita, and millage yield (a ratio of the taxable value per mill 
levied). Starting in FY2012, the statutory revenue sharing was replaced with 
the Economic Vitality Incentive Program (EVIP). M The EV1P allocates funding 
to cities, villages, and townships based on their ability to satisfy certain 
criteria, but relies on the old statutory program to determine participation and 
individual payment amounts. Exhibit IV-8 shows the breakdown between the

constitutional payments and statutorv/EVIP payments to the City of Flint since 
FY1998. While constitutional payments have been fairly constant, there has been 
a substantial decline in statutory/EVIP payments. 

Exhibit SV-9 displays the change in state shared revenue over time as reported 
in the city’s financial audit reports. 

Charges for Services 

While all other revenue sources have been declining since FY2006, income from 
user fees and charges for services have actually increased on a nominal basis over 
the same period (Exhibit IV-10). Though it has fluctuated in recent years, the 
percentage of revenues and transfers from, charges for services is still relatively 
high compared to FY2G06. This is indicative of cities undergoing fiscal stress 
since they seek to replace the typical tax and intergovernmental sources with 
other revenue streams.

i City clerk 

> Law office 

> Human resources 

> City administrator 

Expenditures on general government have followed an overall decline since 
FY2008 (Exhibit IY-13). The exception in FY2011 was due to a settlement 
payment related to a lawsuit against the city regarding the sale of the Genesee 
Towers building. 

Revenues and expenditure trends for other governmental funds are shown in 
Exhibit iV-14. These include special revenue funds and debt service funds. As 
of FY2014, special revenue funds consist of the following types of funds:

The City of Flint’s two proprietary funds include water supply and sewer 
disposal operations. Prior to FY2G12, Hurley Medical Center and the Golf 
Division were considered business-type activities as part of the city government 
under proprietary funds. However, starting in FY2012, the city began presenting 
Hurley as a separate component: unit in the audit report, and in March 2012, the 
city entered into agreements with Flint City Golf, LLC, and the Mott Park Public 
Golf Course Association to operate the city’s golf courses. 

Historically, the City of Flint purchased Lake Huron water from, the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). Per a resolution that authorized the 
sale of Drinking Water Revolving Fund bonds, the city government sets its w'ater 
rates to cover expenses of the administration and operation, of the water system. 
These expenses include the rates charged by the DWSD, which had increased 
on average by 10% per year. The rates must be sufficient to pay an amount equal 
to 125% of principal and interest on bonds and any other obligations. In January 
2011, the city increased water and sewer rates by 2.5% and 22% respectively. 
Another increase of 35% on both water and sewer rates followed in September 
2011. it! order to meet these revenue requirements. 

In April 2013, the. city ended its contract with DWSD, and opted instead to 
contract with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to build a pipeline from. 
Lake Huron to Genesee County. Effective October 1, 2013, the City of Flint 
entered into a contract to purchase water from the KWA., with the pipeline 
expected to be completed, in July 2016. The city officially switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, to be used until the agreement with the 
KWA came into effect. However, the city and its residents have experienced 
several issues with water quality since then. xviii . Flint was awarded $2 million 
from the state through Michigan’s Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program to improve its water infrastructure and quality™.

In general, the revenues and transfers Into the water supply fund have exceeded 
expenditures and transfers out (Exhibit 8V-15), 

In contrast, the sewer disposal, fund had seen major deficits annually up 
until FY2013 (Exhibit IV-16). One major contributor to the operating losses 
associated with this fund is internal borrowing by other funds. This will, be

The City of Flint allocates the internal service funds for data processing, fringe 
benefits, central maintenance garage, and self-insurance. Internal service funds 
should be self-sustaining through charges for services to other departments and 
funds. However, this is not always the case, as shown by the positive figures for 
“Transfers In” in Exhibit IY-17. The Central Maintenance Garage Fund received 
incoming transfers for six consecutive years. On average, these transfers amount 
to about 28% of operating costs annually. There was an exception in FY2013, in 
which the Central Maintenance Garage Fund issued an outgoing transfer to the 
Garbage Collection Fund in order to transfer proceeds related to the sale of city 
garbage trucks.

Debt 


The City of Flint’s bond rating has not been updated since the 2011 case study 
was written. The last bond rating was performed by Moody’s Investor Service in 
February 2006. At that time, the City of Flint was assigned a rating of Bal with a 
stable outlook. 

According to the city’s financial audit reports, the City Charter limits net debt 
to 7% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the city. Exhibit 
V-1 discloses breakdown of the city’s net debt limit since 2004. While the 
absolute amount of the city’s debt has been fairly stable over time, the decline 
in property values in the city has closed the legal debt margin considerably 
(Exhibit V~1). As a result, the net debt as a percentage of the debt: limit has 
jumped from about 4.3% in FY2007 to 16.6% in FY20I3. 

Many cities with chronic fiscal stress have a significantly large debt burden, 
which has not necessarily been the case for the City of Flint. The 2011 case study 
noted that this issue of fiscal distress was mainly due to the lack of capacity to 
issue debt or manage a long-term capital improvement program. In FY20U, the 
City made its final payment on an. $8 million financial recovery bond issued in 
2004 when it was operating under the authority of a state-appointed EFM. As 
noted earlier, the current level of fiscal stress has caused the City of Flint to 
seek $20 million fiscal stabilization bonds, of which it received $8 million. These 
funds are intended to address the chronic cash shortage and unfunded prior 
operating expenditures. Recurring cash shortages and the need to finance prior 
years’ operations are often considered additional red flags indicating chronic 
fiscal stress. 

Another symptom of chronic fiscal stress is an increased reliance on internal 
borrowing, another trend that has continued since the 2011 case study. When 
the City of Flint has difficulty obtaining external financing at a reasonable rate, 
cash from, internal funds becomes a default source of borrowing. Exhibit V-2 
summarizes interfund borrowing activity since FY2006. The nature of this type, 
of activity? is generally related to operating transactions among funds. The City 
of Flint has used this to address cash shortages at the close of the fiscal year. 

The “Due to/from Other Funds” section, is related to short-term loans, while the

“Advances to/from Other Funds” is related to long-term loans. A concern, arises 
when these balances are significant in dollar amounts and present for more than 
one year. The City of Flint’s General Fund has relied on short-term interfund 
resources for seven out of the last nine fiscal years and long-term interfund 
resources since FY2GI2. As shown in Exhibit ¥-2, the primary lending fund for 
these transfers has been the Sewer Disposal Division Fund, which contributes to 
the fund’s long-term structural deficit, as reported in Exhibit i¥~1 B on page 26. 
The short-term balance of approximately $13.2 million at June 30, 2013, equates 
to almost 25% of General Fund revenues for FY2014. 

Tn July 2012, the Flint City Council President, along with three other residents, 
filed a lawsuit against: the city, claiming that the water and sewer rate increases 
in 20.1.1 violated city ordinances.** The claim was that because water and sewer 
funds have been transferred to the General Fund, additional funds raised had 
not been allocated toward their intended purposes. A Genesee County Circuit 
Court j udge dismissed the case in June 2013, claiming that: the rate increases 
were in compliance with. Public Act 4, which granted legal power to emergency 
managers to make rate, increases to reflect true operating costs. 

As noted in the 2011 case study, advances among funds are often formalized in 
a written note with, specific payment terms including an interest rate. The City 
of Flint has used advances to fund capital equipment purchases in its internal 
services funds. Such reliance on interfund borrowings may restrict the lending 
fund’s financial flexibility and use of resources for the designated purpose. 
Recent advances from the Sewer Disposal Division Fund to the General Fund 
represent return on equity.

VI. Personnel Costs 


Exhibit VI-1 Flint Full-Time 
Equivalent Employees 

Data source: City of Flint Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report 


Annual 



The City of Flint’s payroll has declined by almost 1,000 full-time equivalent 
employees, about 63%, since 2001 due to attrition and downsizing (Exhibit 
VI-1). This breaks down to a 59% reduction in public safety employees and a 
65% reduction in other city employees. The majority of this reduction has taken 
place since 2008. 


The City of Flint has a defined benefit pension plan with a benefit: that ranges 
from 1.7% to 2.6% of the participant’s Final Average Compensation (FAC) based 
on the last three years of credited service, multiplied by the years of credit 
service based on the date of hire. Employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 
years of credited service (eight: years for appointed officials) or those members 
with 25 years of credited service (23 years for police and fire employees), 
regardless of their age, are entitled to a retirement benefit. Certain police 
members can voluntarily retire at age 50 with 25 years of service. Benefits fully 
vest on reaching 10 years of service with the benefit: payable at age 55. The plan 
requires employee contributions ranging from 0% to 9%. 

Beginning in October 2012, the City of Flint closed out its single-employer plan 
and transferred approximately $270 million of assets to the Michigan Municipal 
Employees’ Retirement System, an. agent multi-employer plan that covers 
substantially all employees of city government:. The City of Flint’s unfunded 
pension liability is $241 million, as of its most recent actuarial valuation. 


Defined benefit plan pension benefits are determined by following a three-part:

Years of Service - Years of service is based on actual employee service, 
although sometimes the employee or employer may “buy” years of service at an 
actuarially determined cost. Unless this is fully funded in advance, it increases 
the long-term liability. 

Final Average Compensation (FAC) - The final average compensation is 
the average of wages or salary paid to the employee based, on a predetermined 
number of years. Identifying what type of compensation is included in the FAC 
is important. If it includes overtime, vacation leave payout, longevity, and other 
pay items, the cost to the employer increases. When the FAC is determined 
using fewer years, typically the benefit is higher since it is based, on highest 
years. When the FAC period is very short, even small increases in overtime, 
compensatory time payout, or accrued leave time payout will increase the 
pension. This is the reason some retirees’ actual pension benefits are higher than 
their regular full-time pay as active employees. 

Pension Multiplier ~ The pension multiplier represents a percent of pay for 
each year or service. 

A cost of living adjustment (COLA) provides an annual increase in benefit 
retirement. A COLA benefit of E2 provides a 2% annual increase in pension 
for retirees. Granting automatic pension increases can further constrain future 
administrations. Employers typically have a pension plan design where they may 
instead grant a one-time COLA adjustment to retirees. 

The proportion of the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) that the city 
government has contributed to cover pension expenses has improved over the 
past several years (Exhibit VI -2), For every year since. FY2009, the City of Flint 
has contributed at least the ARC amount. 

Flint’s pension Unfunded Accrued Actuarial Liability (UAAL) has increased 
from $194 million in 2006 to $323 million in 2011, which was the time of the last 
actuarial valuation (Exhibit Vi-3). The funded ratio fell during this time from 
81% to 61%.

The City of Flint contributes to other post-employment benefits (OPFB) for 
public safety and genera] employees under collective bargaining agreements of 
Local 1799, Local 1600, and Fire Local 352. The proportion of the ARC that the 
city has paid to cover OPEB expenses has improved over the past couple years, 
from 31% in FY2011 to only 114% in FY2014 (Exhibit VS»4). 

Since its actuarial valuation in 2006, the City of Flint’s unfunded OPEB liability 
has been cut by $468 million. The city government began advance funding its 
OPEB plan in FY2012, which has been reflected in its 2012 actuarial valuation. As 
of this valuation, the plan is 0.1% funded, though that dropped to 0% in the 2013 
valuation {Exhibit YI-5).

VII. Conclusion 


On April 30, 2015, Gov. Rick Snyder rescinded the financial 
emergency in Flint and restored home rule and the power 
of the city’s elected officials. It had been more than 10 years 
since the last: time such an event occurred in Flint in the 
summer of 2004. Many questions still continue to swirl 
around the city’s fiscal and economic future. A review of the 
reforms and changes that occurred since the appointment of 
an emergency manager in. 2011 is a useful starting point for 
the city to understand the future fiscal trajectory it faces. 
This review will allow local and state officials to assess the 
reforms and changes in place and shape the future fiscal 
policy of the city of Flint, Michigan. 

Changes implemented by the four emergency managers 
appointed to oversee Flint’s finances were aimed at 
reducing the. city’s considerable budgetary deficit through 
reducing its financial obligations, especially pensions 
and other retiree benefits, while increasing city revenue. 
Some of the most significant changes have impacted the 
employees and retirees of the City of Flint. These two 
groups were the most important creditors of the city 
government. They remain so. Like, many city governments 
in Michigan, Flint, does not. carry a large debt burden 
outside of water and sewer borrowing. This means that city 
retirees and employees are the groups owed the most, by 
the city government and therefore, will be the most: directly 
impacted during a financial reorganization following a fiscal 
crisis. 

The structure of the city government was changed, with 
staffing reduced by 20%. A city administrator, who will 
serve as the city’s chief administrative officer, was hired 
on a five-year contract. Among other responsibilities, the 
city administrator has the authority to negotiate collective 
bargaining agreements with the city’s employee unions. 

Reforms were also made to the way the city’s budgeting 
practices, requiring two-year budgeting and three-year 
financial forecasts to be performed annually. This will allow 
city officials to identify and potentially deal with budgetary 
issues before they occur. The city government also adopted 
a master plan for the first time since the 1960s. The master 
plan identifies a vision for the city. It was developed with 
considerable input from the residents of Flint. 

The electorate of Flint passed a referendum, to have a 
Charter Review Commission put in place in the summer of 
2015. The nine-member commission was elected in May of 
2015. It: will review the entire charter and assess options for 
reform. This is an excellent opportunity for the commission 
and the citizens of Flint to evaluate the current charter 
and determine a path forward for the city government that 
includes short-and long-term solvency. 


The emergency manager signed a number of final orders 
before leaving office in April 2015. These orders involved, 
the city council including agenda and meeting dates. They 
also included setting the special assessment for street 
lighting, restoring mayor and city council compensation, 
and. adopting a set budget for FY 2016 and 2017. In addition, 
they included an order ensuring compliance with the so- 
called hard cap section of PA 152 of 2011 stating that the city 
shall not pay more than 80% of employee healthcare plans. 

The final and perhaps most important order of the Flint 
emergency manager was issued on April 30, 2015. The 
overall purpose of the order is to ensure that the mayor 
and city council shall implement reforms and changes to 
maintain the fiscal stability of the city government. These 
provisions included following the recommendations of 
the Receivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) and 
city administrator. Specific, other actions include 1) fully 
funding the annual pension requirement, 2) not interfering 
with city employees, 3) observing the. budget ordinance, 4) 
ensuring all local laws are consistent with state laws, 5) not 
issuing debt without approval of the RTAB, 6) documenting 
all city liabilities, 7) verifying the appropriate eligibility 
requirements of all official city positions, 8) acting 
expeditiously on all economic development projects, and 9) 
reviewing and acting expeditiously on all intergovernmental 
cooperation initiatives by the city administrator. All of 
these provisions are intended to ensure that the. city 
government, as dictated by the mayor and city council, 
follow certain practices and recommendations that are. 
intended to maintain fiscal stability and solvency. These 
types of provisions were not in place after the 2002-04 
crisis. 

The city administrator is also subject to a number of 
provisions in the final EM order. These provisions include 
1) overseeing day-to-day operation of city government, 2) 
negotiating and recommending changes to bargaining unit 
contracts to the RTAB, 3) submitting regular reports on 
city progress, 4) ensuring full compliance with PA 436 of 
2012, 5) not removing city administrator without approval 
of RTAB, 6) observing all purchasing order ordinances, and. 
7) serving as primary interface between city council and 
city employees. Again, all of these provisions are meant: to 
ensure the fiscal, stability or the city government. 

The changes made by the emergency managers have 
improved Flint’s financial position. The general fund deficit 
was reduced from its peak of over $.19 million in FY2012 
to just over $8 million in the most recent fiscal year. The 
city has applied for a $7 million loan from Michigan’s 
Emergency Loan Board, which would effectively eliminate 


33 




this deficit. Pension and OPEB liabilities have been 
significantly reduced, and reforms to employee collective 
bargaining agreements have reduced future legacy costs. 
Other cost-saving measures include transferring emergency 
dispatch to Genesee County and contracting out waste 
collection. 

Despite the progress made since a fiscal emergency was 
declared, in 20.1.1, the City of Flint still faces considerable 
challenges to its fiscal solvency. Outgoing emergency 
manager jerry Ambrose mentioned some of these in his 
final letter, including the lawsuit filed on behalf of Flint’s 
retirees over changes made to their healthcare benefits, 
the structural deficit that still exists in the city’s financial 
projections, challenges to fund the city’s public safety 
needs, and the city’s ageing infrastructure. 

The overall Flint fiscal playbook that has been enacted by 
the state government and. its emergency managers serves 
as an important: template for these types of interventions.^ 


11 This statement is not meant as recommendation or approval for the 
state emergency manager law. There are many dimensions upon which 
the state emergency manager should be assessed. This statement is 
simply meant to reflect that, in following this path, the Flint experience, 
with one of the state’s largest cities, may be an important reference 
point. 


The first part of the playbook is that any reforms or 
changes must be in reference to the largest component of 
the fiscal problem, which in this case related to liabilities 
owed to employees and retirees. Many important changes 
were made to wages and compensation, pension system 
benefits, medical benefits and other such liabilities. Of 
equal or perhaps greater importance, there are a number 
of safeguards now in place to ensure that these changes 
remain in place for a long period. Any adjustments to these 
reforms must go through the city administrator and the 
RTAB. These safeguards are obviously meant to prevent 
any backsliding to previous wage or benefit: levels, it is this 
type of activity that led to the most recent crisis, as changes 
made by the emergency financial manager in 2004 were not 
kept in. place and most of those changes were rescinded 
by the elected officials between 2004 and. 2011. Those 
changes, combined with the worst recession since the Great 
Depression, meant that the city faced, short- and long-term 
fiscal insolvency in 2011.

Dear Governor, 

I am renewing my call for additional funding to address Flint's water challenges. While 
significant progress has been made, with the fiscal stress and pending lawsuits against the City, 
there is a gap in the funds necessary to meet the adopted capital improvement plan and to 
respond to new needs with lead pipes. Attached is a letter of request. I thank you in advance for 
your willingness to review. 

Sincerely, 

Mayor Walling

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state 
approval still needed 

By Dominic Adams | dadam s5 @m 1 i ve. com 

on March 25, 2013 at 10:45 PM, updated March 26, 2013 at 1 :28 AM 
FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part 
of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25, may 
have set in motion the end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from 
Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout 
the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and 
will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must 
approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings 
surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 
There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the 
economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River Watershed 
Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we 
are at risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be 
approved by a county water and waste advisory board. The KWA board will then 
be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint 
has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over $50,000 must be 
approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay 
roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly 
$4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years by 

l 



getting water from the KWA. 

“It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less 
with the capacity level approved by city council because there will be increased 
treatment cost for the river water.” 

Fie said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 1 8 million gallons per day or there 
would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and 
Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times per year. 
Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote. 

“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel 
like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and 
Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to 
purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials said they intend to 
purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

Good Morning, 


Please find attached some new reports from MSU regarding the Flint EM years (2011-2014) which is a follow-up to our 
2011 report on Flint. 

Find here the original Flint report: 

https://www.dtyofflint.CQm/wp-content/upio3ds/Reports/MSUE FiintStudy2Qll.pdf 


The second report documents the role of state government in the fiscal affairs of Local Government. In particular, you 
will note: 

• Page 9, figure 4 that Michigan escalated its local tax limitations more than almost any state except Colorado 

• Page 11, figure 5, Michigan is a stick state in regards to local aid 

• Page 14, figure 6, Ml is ranked as being high cost and high revenue pressure (meaning revenue restrictions) 
which is the worst of both worlds 


Our research points to the fact that Michigan policies are a major part of the cause of local fiscal distress, not the only 
cause but a major contributing factor. This is the first time we are aware of being able to quantify this conventional 
wisdom and place it in the fifty state context. 

Thank you

Executive Summary 


One provocative pattern to emerge from the Great 
Recession is that instances of acute local fiscal distress 
have clustered in certain states and not others. As recently 
as last year in Michigan, a state appointed Emergency 
Manager was operating in each of 17 local governments 
and school districts. A recent California Policy Center 
report suggests that more than a dozen cities and counties 
in California - a state that has already experienced three 
recent, high-profile municipal bankruptcies and a near- 
bankruptcy in San Jose, the “capital of Silicon Valley” - are 
on the cusp of defaulting on general obligation bonds 

With the generous support of the C.S. Mott Foundation 
and Michigan State University, we have engaged in a 
multi-pronged, multi-method research program to assess 
the crucial but often overlooked role of state governments 
in shaping the ways in which cities respond to financial 
difficulties. This report, based on our analysis of a unique, 
nearly half-century-long dataset of state and local financial 
and policy information and correspondence with state 
officials, analysts and legal experts involved in state-local 
fiscal affairs, elaborates several key findings: 

• Municipal fiscal distress is not simply a local problem. 
State laws and policies provide state governments with 
extraordinary influence over the ability of cities to 
balance revenue and expenditure flows. The common 
perception that critical taxing and spending decisions 
are largely within a city government’s control tends to 
conceal this fundamental detail about American state- 
local fiscal relations. 

• The ways in which state lawmakers act on this 
influence varies from state to state and over time. We 
refer to the complex mix of laws and policies that 
prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions as 
the state context for local fiscal distress. Section 1 of 
this report assesses key elements of this state context 
for the lower 48 states since 1970. 

• Some states incubate local financial stress by 
simultaneously driving up spending pressures on 
their cities while curtailing their capacity to raise 
critical revenue. Since the 1970s, the proliferation of 
state-imposed tax revenue limitations, coupled with 
recurring cuts to state aid, has fostered a system that 
limits a city’s ability to fund critical services. Some 
state governments further undermine the fiscal capacity 


of their cities via state laws and policies that engender 
steep expenditure-side pressures (e.g., devolving 
program responsibilities or driving up labor costs). We 
classify these states as incubators of fiscal distress. 

• Michigan incubates financial stress among its local 
governments. Michigan’s particular mix of stringent 
limitations on local revenue and its relatively low level 
of financial assistance to cities, coupled with spending 
pressures stemming from spiking local service burdens 
and increased labor costs, creates conditions that drive 
up the potential for local fiscal distress. 

• Because state governments can foster dramatically 
different state contexts for local fiscal stress, there is no 
single model policy for state intervention in distressed 
cities or for prevention of local fiscal distress. A 
policy that does not address a state’s unique context 

is unlikely to help cities escape financial trouble over 
the long term. State lawmakers must decide which 
legal and political tradeoffs they are willing to make 
to support city fiscal health. Michigan lawmakers, 
for instance, must recognize that the state context 
contributes to the problem of local fiscal distress. An 
aggressive intervention policy does little to curtail the 
consequences of this state-imposed context. Section 
2 of this report draws policy lessons from comparable 
states in an effort to illustrate alternative approaches to 
state involvement in local fiscal affairs. 

This report’s practical recommendations are aimed at 
assisting the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
policy and legal approach to local fiscal crises. These are 
not overly startling recommendations, yet they are easy to 
neglect because policymakers tend to focus more on short- 
term political gain rather than the histories and unintended 
consequences of policies that, over time, become 
increasingly difficult to alter. Some key recommendations: 

• Creating a state agency that coordinates services to 
local governments and offers technical support and 
fiscal monitoring. 

• Raising awareness among citizens and state decision 
makers that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at 
the local level. Though state governments are certainly 
part of the solution, they can be a big part of the 
problem as well. 


Introduction 


A recent spate of research and media reports suggest that as 
the fiscal consequences of the Great Recession continue to 
subside, state and local fiscal conditions are on the upswing. 
American cities and locales, however, are not yet out of 
the woods. A recent analysis from the National League of 
Cities strikes the proper tone of caution when reporting 
that, though indeed state governments have recovered (albeit 
slowly), “...local fiscal health has not yet fully returned to pre- 
recession levels. ... While tax revenues continue to improve, 
increases in service costs, long-term infrastructure needs, 
employee wages, and pension and healthcare obligations, 
along with decreased levels of state and federal aid, continue 
to constrain the [local] fiscal oudook” (McFarland and 
Pagano, 2014, p. 1, emphasis added). 

One thought-provoking pattern to emerge from the aftermath 
of the Great Recession is that the fiscal outlook seems to 
be particularly bleak among local governments in certain 
states. The city of Detroit’s bankruptcy proceedings may 
have indicated that Michigan is something of a hotbed for 
local financial disaster. Yet a far more damning indicator 
is the prevalence of financial distress among the state’s 
other local governments. As recently as last year, 17 local 
governments and school districts were operating under the 
control of a state-appointed emergency financial manager. 
Recently, Michigan’s most populous county, Wayne, was 
recently designated for financial emergency status as well. 
Michigan does not stand alone. News from California, a 
state that has already seen four cities enter the municipal 
bankruptcy process since 2008, is equally discouraging. The 
authors of a recent report conducted for the California Policy 
Center argue that more than a dozen cities and counties in 
California are statistically far more likely than “a typical U.S. 
city or county” to enter bankruptcy proceedings or default 
on general obligation bonds, with several cities - such as 
Compton, King City, Sutter Creek and lone - are a whopping 
20 to 40 times more likely to experience acute financial crisis 
(Joffe and Larkedring, 2015). 

What is it with local governments in these states? When 
it comes to urban fiscal problems, there is much blame to 
go around. Some blame a mixture of national and global 
economic forces beyond the control of state and local 
policymakers. Others contend that the cities facing severe 
budget crises have only themselves to blame. The goal of 
this report is to refocus attention on the crucial but often 
overlooked role of state governments in determining the ways 
in which cities respond to financial difficulties. How and in 
what specific ways do state governments structure this local 
response? Is it possible to assess the fiscal value that all states 
- via their mix of policies, laws and institutions - may add to 
or take away from local fiscal decision making? Is it truly more 
challenging to gain and maintain fiscal sustainability in certain 


states than it is in others? And in light of this consideration 
of the role that state governments play in structuring local 
fiscal decision making, in what ways do state governments 
choose to - or choose not to - internalize their role in the 
design and administration of their fiscal distress intervention 
policy? In other words, can we identify policy self-awareness 
among state governments that place particularly onerous fiscal 
pressures on their local lawmakers? 

To respond to these important questions, we, with the generous 
support of the C.S. Mott Foundation and Michigan State 
University, set out on a multi-pronged, multi-method research 
program at a critical time in which a new era seems to be 
dawning for state-local fiscal relations. This report summarizes 
the findings of the first stage of this ongoing project. 

Section 1 of this report develops an indicator for the state 
context for local fiscal distress based on the mix of state 
laws and policies that directly influence the revenue and 
spending decisions of local governments. This section 
uncovers a number of compelling patterns in the state 
imposition of revenue and spending pressures over the 
past quarter-century. Chief among these patterns is that, 
although a number of states have taken measures to severely 
limit the revenue capacity of their local governments 
(thus reducing the resources available to maintain critical 
services) and several states have devolved greater service 
responsibilities (and higher spending burdens) to their local 
governments, only a small handful of states simultaneously 
drive up spending pressures while aggressively curtailing 
local governments’ capacity to raise revenue. Taken 
independently, state-imposed revenue- and expenditure-side 
pressures can play a determinative role in local fiscal decision 
making. Taken together, as in states such as Michigan and 
California, they incubate local fiscal distress and can serve to 
foster fundamental budgetary imbalances that more fiscally 
challenged local communities are ill-equipped to overcome. 

In Section 2, we draw on interpersonal communications 
with key personnel in several states to assess key elements 
of state policies for intervening in fiscally distressed 
local governments. We set out to identify similarities in 
intervention policies - of which Michigan’s is the poster 
child - and to learn how other states approach local fiscal 
crises differently. From our work with the state officials, we 
illustrate how state governments can more effectively align 
policy with the nature of the problems faced by cities in 
distress, as well as how state-imposed constraints hamper 
cities’ abilities to balance revenues and expenditures over the 
long-term. In Section 3, we combine the lessons from Sections 
1 and 2 to outline recommendations that can assist the C.S. 
Mott Foundation, state and local officials, and Michigan 
residents in identifying a more effective approach to local 
fiscal crises. 


Section 1: Assessing How States Set the 
Context for Local Fiscal Distress: Revenue 
Squeezes and Expenditure-side Pressures 


Two essential powers that local officials enjoy are their 
authority to raise revenues and their power to allocate 
those revenues as they see fit via public expenditures. In 
local media and policy research, city officials are sometimes 
lauded for what are perceived as exciting local policy 
outcomes, such as when a city makes a significant move 
up the “America’s Greenest Cities” or “Child Well-being 
and Health” rankings. More commonly, they are chastised 
for decisions deemed detrimental to the city’s future, 
such as providing generous benefits to the municipal 
workforce, slashing essential services, enacting a rigid 
historical preservation agenda or raising licensing fees. Yet 
the common perception that critical taxing and spending 
decisions - and, by extension, the apportionment of blame 
and credit associated with the outcomes of such decisions 
- are largely within a city government’s control conceals 
a fundamental detail about American state-local fiscal 
relations: state laws and policies provide state governments 
with extraordinary influence over nearly every aspect of city 
budgeting. From the type and level of financial assistance 
that state governments deliver to state-imposed controls 
over local revenues; to the growing practice and use of 
state mandates, preapproval and preemption; to minimum 
service standards; to the formal or informal consultations, 
advice or technical assistance that state governments may 
(or may not) provide, local governments in America, in the 
words of influential legal scholars Gerald Frug and David 
Barron (2008, p. 75), simply “do not have anything like the 
kind of local fiscal autonomy often attributed to them.” 

States influence local governments’ capacity to balance 
revenue and expenditure flows in a variety of ways. In 
this report, we focus on two core dimensions of this 
state context for local financial distress. 1 The first is the 
degree to which states participate in adding or reducing 
local revenue capacity via the policy balance between the 
buoyancy of state-granted aid and shared revenue, and the 
severity of state-imposed controls over city tax revenues. 
Although most states exhibit a relatively balanced policy 
approach to local revenue capacity, some state governments 
have responded to local revenue challenges by granting 
greater access to state intergovernmental aid while mostly 
suppressing financial controls over local taxes. These 
are revenue “carrot” states. Another group - revenue 

1 Formally defined as the complex, multidimensional, legal-policy 
frameworks that prescribe the powers, rights and capacities of local 
lawmakers to respond to their financial conditions. 


“stick” states, of which Michigan is a prime example - have 
responded to local revenue challenges by ratcheting financial 
controls while offering thin or uncertain compensatory 
aid. Simply put, we expect it to be far more challenging 
to maintain a sustainable fiscal outlook in states that 
simultaneously suppress own-source revenue capacity and 
transfer very little aid to municipalities, particularly during 
national or state economic downturns. 

State policies and actions also burden the opposite 
end of local budgetary processes: decisions over public 
expenditures. Few, if any, local spending responsibilities 
exist because cities choose to take them on. The state 
decides. 2 Spending pressures can be subtler. For instance, 
local labor costs, which account for a large slice of most 
cities’ budgets, are heavily influenced by state policies and 
regulations concerning municipal employees’ wages and 
level of retirement and health care benefits. 3 This basic 
fact should give pause to those who instinctively attribute 
chronic local fiscal distress to “profligate spending on public 
employees” (Greenhut, 2012, pp. 1-2) or “spiraling labor 
and pension costs” (Rozansky, 2012). To borrow again from 
Frug and Barron’s seminal work (2008, p. 199), “Although 
cities are often criticized for granting overly generous 
pensions and health care to their employees, sometimes 
they become supporters of municipal employees’ benefits 
because the state requires them to do so.” Our more general 
argument here is that it is foolish to claim to correctly 
diagnose the causes of local fiscal distress without careful 
examination of the spending context in which states place 
their cities. In this paper, we aim to capture a large slice 
of this expenditure-side context by assessing state public 
sector collective bargaining policies (specifically, those 
covering municipal police, firefighters, teachers and other 
local employees) and public employee union membership 
coverage. 


2 Via specific provisions (or the absence of such provisions) regarding 
local statutory authorization, budgetary constraints or more general 
interpretations of local governments’ home rule authority. 

3 For instance, Michigan, even after the adoption of right-to-work 
legislation in late 2012, mandates binding arbitration for public safety 
officers in the event that involved parties in a labor contract dispute 
cannot reach an agreement. Massachusetts pays out benefits to local 
employees through the State-Boston Retirement System via formulas 
established by state law. Illinois law does not mandate city or employee 
benefit or contribution levels, instead favoring local flexibility in the 
control over pension costs. 




The final segment of this section considers how these 
revenue- and expenditure-side pressures interact within 
and across all U.S. state governments. As one might expect 
(or at least hope), these two competing dimensions tend 
to work against one another. States that are more revenue 
stick (meaning local tax limitation increases outpace 
the distribution of state aid) tend not to impose equally 
exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least in relation to 
local labor costs. For many states that do drive up labor 
and service costs via their mixture of policies, these costs 
are at least partially offset via a more resilient and vibrant 
aid environment, coupled with limited own-source revenue 
restrictions. A few states, such as Michigan and California, 
place strict limits on local own-source revenues while at the 
same time providing only meager intergovernmental aid and 
imposing costly labor and service obligations. We contend 
that these states have structured local fiscal policymaking 
in a way that effectively incubates local financial distress. 
These state contexts are the most egregious in hampering 
the exercise of local fiscal power; yet the nature of the 
problem for cities may be much worse - state-imposed 
budgetary imbalances can engender recurring structural 
deficits and diminished local service capacity, particularly 
among the states’ older, industrial urban areas.

State governments, by virtue of their superior constitutional 
position, have sweeping legal powers to regulate local 
finance. Central to our assessment of the state’s role 
in local fiscal distress are state controls over the two 
dominant sources of city revenue: state aid and local 

Figure 1. Mapping the Average 
State Aid Environment Since 1970 


taxes. Local governments occupy a weak position in the 
American federal system, causing local officials to rely 
heavily on, in the words of one analyst, “whatever sources 
of income the states are willing to let them tap into” or 
“whatever financial assistance” the states are willing to 
provide (Berman, 2003, p. 89). Sbragia (1983) aptly refers 
to the condition of American federalism as “the municipal 
money chase,” and in the absence of a vibrant federal aid 
environment in the United States, state aid - in the form 
of shared taxes (typically sales, income and gasoline) and 
restricted or unrestricted grants - continues to be a major 
source of local government revenue, accounting for roughly 
a third of local revenue, on average, during the past two 
decades (Berman, 2003; Urahn et al., 20 12). 4 

The importance of a well-designed state aid system is hard 
to overstate. It allows local officials greater flexibility in 
responding to economic pressures and the service needs of 
residents. This flexibility is particularly valuable during 
periods of economic downturn. Because local governments 
vary widely in their tax bases and in their ability to raise 
critical own-source revenues, influential research illustrates 
the equalizing potential of state aid, particularly in helping 
to smooth out revenue gaps between wealthier and poorer 
local jurisdictions (Pelissero, 1984; Stein and Hamm, 1987). 
In the past few decades, very few states target aid to local 
governments as a function of local need (Stein and Hamm, 

4 Though formulas for the distribution of local aid can vary significantly 
across states (as well as within states over time), all states provide 
some form of aid to local governments - often from a historical 
exchange in which cities would forgo the right to collect certain taxes 
in exchange for the states returning revenues from those taxes in some 
form. States typically allocate shared revenue for specific purposes 
or link it to particular functions of local government. Some shared 
revenue, however, is unhindered by such state restrictions and can be 
spent as local lawmakers see fit.

1994). The level of state aid that is available can make 
it possible for certain jurisdictions - for instance, older, 
industrial cities experiencing significant job loss coupled 
with a much reduced tax base - to at least afford minimum 
levels of services and possibly respond to growing service 
demands on the heels of a crippling state or national 
recession (see Ladd and Yinger, 1994). 

How then can we characterize the critical state aid portion 
of the state-controlled revenue environment for American 
cities? Figure 1, which illustrates trends in per capita state 
aid to three classes of city governments, shows a steady 
upward trend in transfers (per capita) received from state 
governments. Though it is beyond the scope of this project 
to analyze specific revenue-sharing rules and aid formulas 
over time and across state contexts, our city financial data 
allow us to compare important trends in what the Census 
of Governments classifies as “Total Intergovernmental 
Revenue from the State Government.” 5 In other words, we 
plot data indicating the fiscal outputs of these rules and 
decisions. As Figure 1 illustrates, the positive trend over 
time is particularly strong for cities with populations over 
100, 000. 6 On average, it would seem that state governments 
have helped at least larger cities meet increasingly 
difficult financial conditions through the extension of 
intergovernmental transfers. 

Figure 2, which compares levels and growth of per capita 
state aid across the contiguous 48 states, paints a bleaker 
portrait. Consistent with the findings presented in Figure 
1, 43 of the 48 states exhibit positive growth rates, meaning 
that roughly 90 percent of the lower 48 states provided 
higher levels of aid in the current era than in the early 1970s 
(mean increase = 256 percent). Figure 1, however, masks 
the considerable unevenness with which state governments 
deliver aid. This unevenness is on display in Figure 2, 
where fewer states provide above average levels of aid, and 
most states exhibit relatively flat growth in the distribution 
of state aid. 7 


5 This includes state grants-in-aid, regardless of basis of distribution; 
local share of state-collected taxes; payments in lieu of taxes on 
state property; and reimbursement for services performed for state 
government (e.g., care of state prisoners in local jails, construction 
or maintenance of state highway facilities, etc.) (U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, 2006). 

6 In 1970, these cities received roughly $160 per capita (in real 2005 
dollars) in state intergovernmental revenue; in 2005, the most recent 
year in our time series, average per capita aid was $470. Though the 
growth rate for small and medium-sized cities is not as steep, the 
steady uptick in average per capita state aid exemplifies a healthier 
state aid environment than in the past. 

7 As is indicated by the maroon-colored vertical line, the average 
per capita aid provided to local governments in 2005 was just over 
$340. Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and Utah provided around $40 per 
person, on average. New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, on the other hand, distributed intergovernmental 
revenue at an annual rate at or around $1,000 per resident.

One key reason for this unevenness is that state aid tends to 
ebb and flow with changing state-level economic conditions 
(Berman, 2003, pp. 100-102). More generally, state 
intergovernmental aid - particularly those discretionary 
resources distributed via statutory aid policies and 
unprotected by state constitutions - is inextricably linked 
to state legislative budget battles. State legislatures and 
governors, scrambling to balance their own budgets, are 
simply more likely to risk citizen backlash from significant 
aid cuts during periods of widespread budget shortfalls. 
What is more, state lawmakers across the country seem to 
be looking with decreasing favorability on the idea of, in 
the derisive words of one Wisconsin legislator, “being an 
ATM machine for local governments” (Rinard, 1999, p. 1). 

Figure 2, however, illustrates that not all states have chosen 
to respond to their revenue difficulties by making cuts 
to intergovernmental aid. A study from Pew’s American 
Cities Project reports that Connecticut, which provides 
one of the more vibrant aid environments in the country, 
chose to slightly bolster intergovernmental aid to its 
local governments on the heels of the Great Recession (in 
fiscal year 2010) and has not reported a cut since then. 
Nebraska, on the other hand, canceled all funding to its 
local governments in 2011; Maryland, California, Arizona, 
Nevada, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming made 5 
to 6 percent cuts that same year. All else being equal, we 
would expect it to be far less onerous to balance revenue 
and expenditure flows in city governments in states such 
as Connecticut, New York or Massachusetts - i.e., states 
where key state decision makers seem less inclined to 
shift service costs to local governments via cuts in state 
aid during times of state financial stress - than in cities 

Figure 3. Proliferation and 
Layering of TELs Since 1970 


facing similar sets of environmental, political or managerial 
conditions in states that provide lower or more volatile 
levels of intergovernmental aid. 

State policies regarding levels and delivery of state aid are 
but one piece of an increasingly complex set of structures 
that govern local revenue capacity. In a classic textbook 
on American intergovernmental relations, Stephens and 
Wikstrom (2006, p. 196) remark, “Without doubt, the most 
important mechanism that the state has for influencing 
the political behavior of local officials involves financial 
assistance.” This may have been true in the 1970s or 1980s, 
and to be sure it is a fundamental tenet of traditional 
models of fiscal federalism, but the most important 
mechanism for controlling local fiscal behavior in the past 
quarter- century is the tax and expenditure limit (TEL) - 
a label that broadly captures state attempts to limit the 
taxing and/or spending authority of its local governments 
through constitutional amendment or legislative enactment. 

State governments have long imposed some manner of 
TEL. 8 Figure 3 tracks the adoption of TELs since 1970 
across the four most common categories: rate limits - which 
are overall or specific tax rate limits that set the ceiling on 
the aggregate tax rate, which cannot be exceeded without 
a vote of the electorate; property tax levy limits, which 
constrain the total amount of revenue that can be raised 
from the property tax (independent of the property tax 
rate); assessment increase limits, which cap the growth rate of 
assessed values and is intended to control the ability of 
local government to raise revenue either by reassessment 
of property or through escalation of property values; and 

8 For instance, the first states to establish property tax rate limits were 
Rhode Island (1870), Nevada (1895), Oklahoma (1907) and Ohio (1911). 



8 





limits on general revenue or general expenditure increases, which 
set the maximum growth rate of total revenue or total 
spending. 

Whereas a great deal of research has shown that the 
appearance of even a single TEL constrains the capacity 
of local officials to generate revenues on their own (see 
Poterba and Rueben, 1995; Shadbegian, 1996, 1999; it is 
the accumulation or layering of fiscal constraints that can 
be particularly damaging to the revenue capacity of local 
lawmakers. 9 In single-TEL states, for instance, raising 
assessments might be employed to circumvent property 
tax rate limits and vice versa; in states that impose only 
an assessment cap, this single limitation could potentially 
be overcome by adopting a higher rate. These methods 
of circumvention were common early in the 1970s, when 
24 of the 29 states adopting some form of TEL imposed 
only one constraint (mostly rate limits), and a mere five 
states imposed two revenue TELs. Today, at least 27 of 
the contiguous 48 states impose multiple revenue TELs. 
Nineteen states impose two, and eight states - Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Mexico and Washington - apply three local tax limitations. 

The number of TELs in a state does not necessarily capture 
the severity of the limitation(s), though it is reasonable 
to expect a higher frequency of TELs to create a more 
restrictive local tax environment. Figure 4 displays a 
measure of TEL severity (see appendix regarding our 
research approach beginning on page 25), with the open 
point illustrating the severity of the state’s TEL in 1970, 
the closed (maroon) point plotting restrictiveness in 2005, 
and the dashed horizontal line representing the change 
in severity of the state’s tax limitations. 10 Figure 4 reveals 
some noteworthy patterns that illustrate the reality of state 
policy choices regarding local tax structures. Michigan, a 
state that imposes one of the more onerous sets of revenue 
restrictions, achieved this status via a one-two punch of 
major constitutional amendments enacted by voters: the 
Headlee Amendment in 1978 and Proposal A in 1994. 11 The 
Headlee Amendment capped local property tax millage 
rates to the rate of inflation. Proposal A - a constitutional 
amendment quite similar to Proposition 13 in California, a 
state with a similarly restrictive fiscal relationship with its 
locales - further limited local property tax revenue growth 

9 Rising adoption rates are on display in Figure 3. So, too, is the 
increasingly common phenomenon of TEL layering, meaning the 
imposition of state-imposed controls on multiple elements of the 
local tax structure. And those controls are growing: in 1970, 29 of the 
contiguous 48 states had at least one revenue TEL; today, some 41 of 48 
states have at least one local revenue limit. 

10 The measure of TEL severity, initially proposed by Amiel, Deller and 
Stallmann (2009), indexes six key characteristics: the type of TEL (see 
discussion above), if the TEL is statutory or constitutional, growth 
restrictions, method of TEL approval, TEL overrides and exemptions, 
and method of override. For a more detailed discussion of this 
measure, see Amiel, Deller, and Stallmann (2009) and Maher and 
Deller (2013).

by changing the system of assessment to cap individual 
property values and prohibiting cities from “rolling up” 
a millage to the rate of inflation if actual property value 
growth was lower than inflation. 12 Taken together, these 
two large TEL ratchets, which came 17 years apart and 
layered on top of an already aggressive property tax rate 
limit, placed tremendous pressure on local lawmakers’ 
ability to generate critical revenue (Brunori et al., 2008). 
Contrast Michigan’s approach to that of Massachusetts’s 
Prop 2 Vi, a similarly infamous state-imposed TEL, which 
was passed by referendum in 1980 and effectively caps 
local property tax levies at 2.5 percent of real property 
value. Massachusetts’s relatively moderate position on the 
severity index owes much to the state’s choice to apply no 
corresponding rate, revenue or assessment limits on local 
lawmakers. 

TELs, taken alone, are neither inherently good nor bad. 

They have been alternately portrayed as necessary evils 
for taming “Leviathan” city governments (Brennan and 
Buchanan, 1979; Craw, 2008; Downes and Figlio, 1999), 
or as just plain evils that stifle cities’ abilities to pursue 
innovative visions for their futures (Frug and Barron, 

2008). 13 However, over three decades after the tax revolt 
movement took hold in a major way in states such as 
California and Michigan, the widespread adoption of local 
TELs depicted in Figures 1 and 2 has had two overarching 
effects: the first is the loss of local revenues; the second is 
decreasing local reliance on property taxes. 14 There is little 
evidence to suggest that TELs, however, promote local fiscal 
sustainability. The reason is that local spending mostly 
goes unaffected by revenue limits (Dye and McGuire, 1997), 
particularly in the absence of state-imposed spending lids, 
which exist in only a small handful of states. 15 

In sum, the proliferation of state-imposed TELs has 
helped to create a national state-local fiscal system that 
is simply less conducive to local governments’ abilities to 
fund their own activities. 15 States with more aggressive 
local TELs - such as Michigan, Colorado and California 

12 Many other provisions of both the Headlee Amendment and Proposal 
A are related to other parts of the state finance system, and a detailed 
examination of the depth of both laws would be a paper unto itself. 

We will discuss the impacts of these types of laws, generally and in 
Michigan, later in the paper. 

13 To be sure, they are a frequent source of local consternation, 
particularly as fixed costs occupy a larger share of local budgets and 
demand for services - driven by postrecession unemployment rates, 
population changes and other factors - continues to rise. 

14 Indeed, in many state contexts, forgone property tax revenues have at 
least partially been recovered via more regressive revenue sources - 
such as fees and, where allowed, sales taxes. 

15 This is an important point that is often obscured by the frequent 
reliance on the TEL acronym (Tax and Expenditure Limits). 

16 Amidst the national clamor for government austerity and fiscal 
responsibility, it is important to point out that these activities - 
particularly in the states that impose the most formidable set of 
revenue constraints, such as Michigan, California and Colorado - 
include essential local services such as public safety and infrastructure 
maintenance, which are critical functions of local government. 


- hinder the revenue capacity of their local governments. 
This capacity is vital during even the most moderate of 
economic downturns because service demands tend to 
rise and state aid tends to drop. Revenue slack, however, 
was particularly vital during the most recent recession. In 
previous downturns, home prices mostly remained stable, 
thus steadying property tax revenues (particularly in 
relation to sales and income taxes). In the 2009 recession, 
property tax revenues, already slowed in certain states 
via state-imposed TELs, plummeted in simultaneity with 
state aid. The good news, as we illustrate below, is that 
a relatively small number of states impose such crippling 
revenue constraints from both ends: meaning states 
that both limit own-source revenue capacity while also 
providing far from vibrant levels of state aid. The bad news 
is that, for local officials who must operate within those 
state environments, even small declines in revenues can 
present tremendous budgetary challenges. 

Napping the Revenue Squeeze: Revenue 
“Carrot" and Revenue “Stick” States 

As property tax revenues continue to erode as a function 
of state-imposed TELs and local governments have become 
more reliant on state aid, some observers have suggested 
that state governments have responded to their expanding 
role in local fiscal affairs by providing greater levels of 
intergovernmental revenues (Berman, 2003; Sokolow, 2000; 
Dye and McGuire, 1997b). 17 This reading of state-local fiscal 
dynamics is somewhat supported by comparing trends in 
average levels of state aid to local governments exhibited 
in Figure 1 and total revenue limit adoptions depicted in 
Figure 3. However, our data allow for a far more detailed 
look at how local revenue capacity is being affected by state 
policies for local governments within each of the lower 48 
states. 

Figure 5 depicts a rough state-level indicator of the severity 
of state restrictions on local revenue capacity. States for 
which our standardized measure of per capita state aid 
far exceeds our standardized measure of the severity of 
local revenue limits - such as Connecticut, New York, 
Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey - 
are depicted in orange and labeled revenue carrot states. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be buttressed by 
their state context. As was pointed out above, a well- 
structured state aid environment increases the overall fiscal 
capacity of local governments and, according to Pagano and 
Hoene (2010, p. 260), can provide “a level of equalization 
and base support for municipalities that may lack other 
resources.” Additional value to local revenue capacity 
stems from the fact that critical own-source revenues are 

17 Greater local reliance on state aid does not necessarily mean that 
state officials have “anteed up,” a point that, mainly because of data 
constraints, is too often overlooked.

either altogether unencumbered by the absence of state 
TELs, as in Connecticut; limited only on the margins, as in 
Rhode Island or Tennessee; or limited via more aggressive 
TELs offset via significant funding from the state, as in 
Massachusetts. 

Revenue stick states - such as Michigan, Colorado, 

Washington and California - are depicted in brown. These 
state governments (or state citizens via the referendum or 
initiative process) constrain the fiscal autonomy of local 

government officials rather than buttress it via state aid. Figure 5. Revenue “Carrot” and Revenue “Stick” 
An extensive body of research on the local effects of state- States 
imposed TELs strongly suggests that revenue limits have 
worked: local own-source revenues have been reduced in 
the states that impose such limitations. Though there is 
some historical evidence that state legislatures in certain 
states have offset these limitations via state aid (Mullins 
and Joyce, 1996), revenue stick states tend to be far less 
generous in the allocation of intergovernmental revenue. 

All else being equal, we would expect the revenue capacity 
of local governments in these states to be constrained by 
their state context. 

Michigan, for instance, has a TEL score well above the 
most recent annual state average, coupled with slightly 
below average state aid. The problem with local fiscal 
sustainability in revenue stick states such as Michigan 
stems from local governments’ heightened reliance on 
state revenues, which in Michigan is a function of two 
large TEL ratchets and, in the post-Great Recession period, 
sharply declining property tax revenues. This high degree 
of dependency remains in place today. Yet, much like the 
way that Michigan’s Proposition A has exposed critical local 
education funding to state budgetary battles (Cullen and 
Loeb, 2004), the state’s unyielding property tax rate limits, 
coupled with special features of the Headlee Amendment 
that forbid the use of some alternative revenue sources 
employed in other states (e.g., income, sales and motor fuel 
taxes), have had the unfortunate side effect of essentially 
entwining local fiscal health with state legislative politics. 

As the state economy faltered under a one-state recession 
throughout much of the 2000s (Darga, 2011), the past 
decade has seen both clear declines in statutory revenue 
sharing and heightened levels of uncertainty over revenue- 
sharing rules (Lavelle, 2014, pp. 2-3). 

Michigan’s is a precarious fiscal context even for the most 
well-managed city government. It is particularly onerous 
for lawmakers in older, industrial cities such as Flint, 
which has been dealing for some time with sustained 
job and population loss, waning bureaucratic capacity, 
and increasingly daunting economic, social and physical 
challenges (see Doidge et al., 2015). In the words of one 
local official, if aid is reduced, “It’s not rocket science ... 
pretty much raise taxes or cut services. That’s what it boils 
down to” (McDermott and Powers, 2002, p. 12). Local 
lawmakers in a state such as Michigan, where they operate 



11 




with very limited discretion over revenue capacity, can boil 
it down even further: reduce or eliminate services or face 
the prospects of possible financial meltdown. All cities face 
political constraints on raising tax revenue. And certainly, 
some cities have managed their financial affairs in the face 
of economic decline better than others. However, for those 
seeking to fully grasp the nature of local fiscal health, we 
must continue to focus on ways in which states effectively 
create a mismatch between fiscal needs and available 
resources into their cities’ local fiscal decision-making 
environment.

In addition to the revenue squeeze that some states impose 
on their local governments, state governments also impose 
a range of expenditure-side pressures that can drive up 
local costs. 18 As state governments continue to streamline 
bureaucracies and downsize operations, service burdens 
have been shifted onto local governments, often “without 
careful consideration whether this was the correct 
course” (Gold and Wallin, 1999, p. 73). As one prominent 
National League of Cities report argues (2003, p. 23), the 
transference of “program responsibilities from state and 
federal government, as well as the imposition of state and 
federal mandates, increase the roles and responsibilities of 
municipal governments, often without corresponding fiscal 
capacity or authority.” Observers and analysts interested 
in the expenditure-side burdens that state policies place 
on local officials typically focus on the effects that costly 
mandates in areas such as health care and pollution 
abatement have on local government budgets (see Berman, 
2003, pp. 77-83). Far less attention is paid to what we might 
call de facto spending pressures - the hidden but potentially 
damaging state-level decisions, policies and institutions 
that can destabilize local governments’ fiscal capacity. 

Consider, as we do in this report, local governments’ large 
and increasing burden to pay for previously obligated 
labor costs. Labor costs, including wages and benefits 
for current employees as well as pensions and other 
postemployment benefits (OPEB) such as retiree healthcare, 
currently make up the largest category of operating costs 
for local governments. As pointed out in a recent MSU 
white paper (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013), municipalities 
were not required to measure the total costs of OPEB 
until an accounting standard was issued in 2004, with 
implementation beginning in 2007. Now that local 
governments have calculated and accounted for OPEB, 

18 This general phenomenon has been termed “second-order devolution” 

- meaning the transfer of program administration and/or substantive 
policy powers from the federal and state governments to America’s 
cities and municipalities (see Bowman and Kearney, 2011). 


many are faced with a massive commitment. Indeed, 

MSU’s review of Michigan cities facing severe fiscal stress 
revealed that each city was confronted with a substantial 
unfunded OPEB liability (Scorsone and Bateson, 2013). 

Though local government employee pensions and OPEB 
are seemingly always in the headlines, few seem to be 
asking why observers are more able to link labor costs 
to local fiscal distress in certain states than in others. 

Why do we hear so much about Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
California, Rhode Island and New Jersey? The answer, 
not surprisingly, is that, although city lawmakers are 
often criticized for overly cozy relationships with public 
employee labor unions (see, for instance, Gillette, 2014a; 
Rozansky, 2012; Greenhut, 2012), critical elements of 
employee benefit costs are structured by state law. State 
law may require bargaining by the employer, may provide 
only for a bargaining forum without requiring it or, 
alternatively, may simply prohibit collective bargaining 
altogether. State laws vary in the coverage of certain types 
of local employees. These rules address the types of items 
that may be bargained over, such as work rules, pay and 
benefits. Finally, the collective bargaining laws may include 
a process for dealing with impasses, such as binding 
arbitration rules. In line with the framework proposed 
at this report’s outset, we view the mix of these rules as a 
set of processes and constraints that directly influence a 
municipality’s fiscal capacity. 

Table 1 places the local public employee collective 
bargaining environment of the contiguous 48 states into a 
five-category classification scheme ranging from very weak 
to very strong. (See the research approach appendix for 
a more detailed explanation of this measure.) As Table 
1 makes plain, states vary with respect to the collective 
bargaining environment for local public employees. Not 
surprisingly, states with strong and very strong collective 
bargaining environments (e.g., those that impose a duty 
to bargain with strong union security provisions) have 
comparatively high union membership rates as well, 
with New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, 
Pennsylvania and Michigan each holding union membership 
rates in excess of 50 percent of state public employees. 
Unionization rates in weak and very weak states, such as 
Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, New Mexico, 
Wyoming, Utah, Georgia and Virginia, on the other hand, 
tend to fall around 10 percent. 19 

State laws concerning pensions and health benefits 
illustrate, in part, how state-imposed structures affect city 
expenditure choices. Yet recent attention to employee 
compensation, pension system funding/underfunding 
and, especially, the cumulative impact of local government 
employee costs on current municipal cash flows have 

19 Statistics from Union Membership and Coverage Database (see Hirsch 
and Macpherson, 2003). 


12 



brought these issues, in particular, into national focus. To 
be clear, we do not suggest that a non-unionized workforce 
is the key to a fiscally sustainable city. City governments 
must compete with other employers for workers, and 
rules governing bargaining are part of a state’s larger 
labor culture. Our simple argument is that, in light of the 
sizeable role for local labor costs in local budgeting as well 
the implementation of new accounting standards, city 
governments operating within states with more permissive 
collective bargaining provisions are more likely to face 
budgetary constraints. It is easy to pin these constraints 
on lousy decision making, yet these constraints owe much 
to higher labor costs and the cumulative costs of payment 
decisions that are, to a large degree, governed by state 
policy. 

C3) The Stale Context for Local 
Fiscal Distress^ Tension Between 
Hexenne and Expenditure Pressures 

Analysis of the interplay of revenue and expenditure 
pressures allows for a more detailed assessment of the 
nature of the fiscal context in which states place their 


local lawmakers. We offer this analysis as something of a 
corrective to the typical perception that a city’s financial 
destiny is either entirely within or entirely outside of its 
control. When assessing why certain local governments 
seem to respond more effectively to their financial problems 
than others, our research suggests that identifying on 
Figure 6 (see page 14) the state in which the city is located 
is a good place to start. The state’s coordinates represent 
an empirical measure of the state context for local fiscal 
distress - meaning the tension for local lawmakers between 
state- imposed revenue-side pressures (captured on the 
horizontal axis) and state-imposed expenditure-side 
pressures (captured on the vertical axis). 20 

20 More technically, the horizontal axis captures our measure of the 
revenue pressures that states inflict upon their local governments 
(standardized TEL severity score minus standardized average per 
capita aid score). The vertical axis represents a standardized measure 
of public employee union coverage, an approximation of the severity 
of the average city’s relatively fixed labor costs. The light gray 
shading represents the distance between one quartile above and one 
quartile below the median; thus states that appear outside these two 
intersecting ranges are quite different from average on both elements of 
the state context. Dark shaded points indicate state governments that 
authorize state intervention in financially distressed local governments.

If state-imposed revenue pressures increased with the 
severity of expenditure pressures, or vice versa, we would 
expect a positive “best fit” line (the dark curving line in 
Figure 6) moving from the lower left-hand quadrant to 
the upper right. As one might expect (or at least hope), 
these two elements of the state context tend to offset each 
other. States such as Colorado and New Mexico - i.e., 
more revenue stick states (local tax limitation increases 
outpace growth in the distribution of state aid) - avoid 
equally exacting expenditure-side pressures, at least when 
it comes to local labor costs. For states that do structure 
local collective bargaining in a way that favors higher local 
labor costs - such as New York, Connecticut and Rhode 
Island - these costs are at least partially offset by a more 
resilient and vibrant aid environment, coupled with limited 
own-source revenue restrictions. 

The relationship between these two elements of the state 
context is negative, but it is not a purely linear relationship. 
Figure 6’s most striking feature is its illustration that states 
placing extreme limitations on local revenue capacity 
(meaning they are more than one standard deviation 
above the state average on the horizontal axis) also tend to 
impose costly labor and service obligations (more than one 
standard deviation above the state average on the vertical 
axis). This relationship between revenue and expenditure 
pressures creates a best-fit line that resembles a backwards 
“J”. This small handful of states that pull the line upward 
- which include Michigan and California - cluster in the 
upper right-hand quadrant of Figure 6. It is no surprise 
that acute financial emergencies have clustered in these 
states. We contend that they have structured local fiscal 
policymaking in a way that effectively incubates financial 
distress. Table 2 classifies the states in an effort to clearly 
represent the position of each of the lower 48 states along 
these two dimensions. 


The threat of recurring structural deficits is “baked in” to 
the state-imposed legal and policy context in which local 
governments choose how to respond to fiscal problems. For 
lawmakers in America’s older, industrial cities who must 
operate within these states, that choice is often not theirs 
to make. As we point out above, these states apply revenue 
and expenditure pressures on the front end, while also 
fostering a fiscal environment that exacerbates fiscal stress, 
links local fiscal health to budgetary battles, and all in all 
restricts the policy “space” for local fiscal policymaking. 
Michigan, however, is the only state among the incubators 
in the top right quadrant of Table 2 and Figure 6 that also 
intervenes “on the back end” by assertively implementing 
one of the nation’s most powerful fiscal distress 
intervention policies (Anderson, 2011; Scorsone, 2014). 

In light of the clustering of distressed localities within 
Michigan’s borders, it comes as little surprise that Michigan 
lawmakers would value a policy that allows state officials 
to help struggling local governments meet conditions of 
chronic fiscal stress (Scorsone and Bateson, 2011; Doidge 
et al., 2015). However, as we discuss below, what is quite 
striking is the relationship between the policy’s goals and 
design - which favors state takeover of local government 
- and the nature and underlying causes of the problem 
of acute fiscal distress. The financial consequences of 
deep-rooted economic and social forces are unlikely to 
be fully alleviated via temporary suspension of local self- 
government. Neither are the often overlooked but critically 
important state-imposed causes analyzed above. In what 
follows, we survey the state governments with more holistic 
and self-aware views of local financial distress in an effort 
to draw important lessons for Michigan lawmakers as they 
continue to struggle with chronic fiscal stress among the 
state’s localities. 


Section 2: If Takeover is the Solution, then 
what is the Problem? What Michigan Can 
Learn from the Ways in Which Other States 
Tackle Problems of Local Fiscal Distress 


In the previous section, we make the case that state 
governments influence how local officials meet their 
financial problems via a combination of laws and policies 
that add or take away intergovernmental or own-source 
revenue capacity and drive up expenditure pressures 
via the allocation of policy authority over government 
functions and labor costs. In certain instances, such as 
when a state government caps property tax revenue and 
sets near insurmountable override standards, the effects 
of certain elements of the state context may be more or 
less direct. A city facing a near identical set of political, 
institutional, economic and social circumstances that 
operates in a neighboring state with no such revenue cap 
at least has the potential to capitalize on this capacity, 
assuming local political and economic constraints allow for 
the imposition of a property tax increase. But mostly the 
effects of this state context are more indirect. The policy 
balance between revenue restrictions and state aid, for 
instance, is not so much a direct measure of state policy 
choice as it is an outcome of a variety of state policy choices 
- e.g., revenue-sharing rules and formulae, the outcomes of 
citizen initiatives involving local TELs, legislative-executive 
budgetary processes, bureaucratic turf battles and so on. 

Since as far back as the late 19* century, when the 
proliferation of railroad bankruptcies prompted states 
to take action to assist struggling localities (see Dimock, 
1935 and 1940), state lawmakers, for fear that “a failing 
municipality will lower the credit rating of other localities 
and the state itself” (Berman, 2003, p. 113), have played a 
far more direct role in responding to local financial distress. 
The current menu of state policy options for intervening in 
distressed communities has been reviewed in two recent 
reports, one by Pew Charitable Trust researchers (Atwell et 
al., 2013) and a second by one of the authors of this report 
(Scorsone, 2014). One key shortcoming of these reports 
is the absence of detailed consideration of state context. 
Simply put, some states are part of the problem - they 
incubate financial distress via stringent restrictions on 
local revenue capacity and state policies precipitating local 
spending pressures. In other states, local policy options 
regarding the balance of revenue and expenditure flows are 
less encumbered by state policies and institutions. This 
diversity among state contexts is particularly important 
when reflecting on “best practices” for states dealing with 


acute local fiscal distress. For instance, close followers 
of issues of local finance often hear and read about North 
Carolina’s strong oversight and monitoring mechanisms 
as standards to which state governments should aspire 
(see, for instance, Mattoon, 2014). But does it make sense 
for a state such as Michigan or New Jersey, for instance, 
to adhere to similar policy principles when local fiscal 
policymaking is structured in such dramatically different 
ways? 

A second shortcoming of these reports is the dearth of 
detailed comparison among the 18 state governments that 
currently have an intervention policy. We refer readers 
to these reports for their quality in cataloguing the formal 
policy powers of state lawmakers on paper. Neither, 
however, is as useful at considering these policies in 
practice. This is a key tension in policy analysis generally 
and in instances of intervention in particular. The choice 
of the state’s appointed and elected officials to employ 
the power they have at their disposal and intervene in 
a distressed community (often meaning the temporary 
suspension of democratic processes) presents a particular 
type of implementation dilemma imbued with questions of 
racial bias, social and economic imbalances, and the legal 
and political culture that guides state-local relations. 

To fully assess the role of state governments in financial 
distress, we held a workshop for state government officials, 
analysts and experts with deep knowledge of state 
operations in local financial affairs. The Workshop on State 
Intervention in Distressed Communities, held in the fall 
of 2014 in Detroit, ultimately brought together a diverse 
group of 28 practitioners and policy experts from six states 
facing similar sets of local fiscal problems: Michigan, Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. 21 
The appendix provides a detailed overview of the structure 
of the event and the types of discussions that were held. 

Our primary goal was to provide a venue facilitating the 
open exchange of ideas and techniques for approaching the 
complicated problems facing cities in fiscal crisis. Indeed, 
as we discuss below, one recommendation of this research 

21 This portion of the process focused specifically on how states approach 
intervention. Though many of the participants in the workshop 
were intimately involved in making decisions at the city level, we 
intentionally chose participants representing the state perspective 
rather than that of local decision makers. 


16 




report is to continue to advance this and similarly minded 
endeavors as a means of facilitating what Peter May (1992) 
refers to as “instrumental policy learning,” which can 
improve state officials’ understanding of the benefits and 
limitations of particular policy approaches or administrative 
designs. A second goal centers on learning more about the 
states’ implementation processes for deciding whether to 
designate a city in distress, take it over temporarily or, in 
the most extreme cases, help shepherd its path to municipal 
bankruptcy. Our final goal was to investigate the types of 
“causal stories” (Stone, 2011) that state officials and experts 
used when considering the fiscal conditions facing their 
local governments. We held structured discussions about 
how the problem of local fiscal distress is defined (i.e., who 
or what bears the responsibility) and the ways in which 
state governments enshrine this problem definition via the 
design and implementation of financial emergency policies. 

In what follows, we begin with a brief outline of Michigan’s 
approach to local financial emergencies, paying special 
attention to linkages between the state’s policy solutions, 
the nature of fiscal stress in Michigan’s municipalities 
and the “front-end” context identified in Section 1. We 
then turn to alternative approaches employed in other key 
states. We begin with North Carolina, a state whose Local 
Government Commission, which administers the policy 
for dealing with financially challenged communities, has 
received a great deal of national credit. We then move 
to states facing more comparable sets of local conditions 
- i.e., with many older, industrial and fiscally vulnerable 
local governments suffering from population and job 
loss - that also have a history of state intervention in 
fiscally distressed communities. The goal here is not 
comprehensive overview. Rather, we set out to identify 
key dissimilarities with the new generation of intervention 
policies - of which Michigan’s current policy is the poster 
child - and to illustrate how state governments facing 
similar sets of challenges can more effectively align their 
policy regarding direct involvement in fiscally distressed 
communities with the nature of problems that these 
communities face, as well as with state-imposed constraints 
that hamper their capacity to balance revenue and 
expenditure flows. 

We designed Table 3 (see page 18) to help guide this 
discussion. The first two columns summarize the state 
context analyzed in Section 1 of this report. The four 
rightmost columns depict information summarizing the 
design and administration of the state’s local financial 
emergency policy. The column labeled “causal story” 
reflects our assessment of how a state government, via its 
legislation of state intervention, comes down on the debate 
over the causes of local financial failure. For some states, 
the focal point is internal causes - poor management, the 
incompetence of local leaders, political corruption, the 
dominance over policymaking by narrow interests, and/or 


“antidemocratic” structures and processes that favor the 
whims of local officials over the needs of local residents 
(Gillette, 2014b). Other states focus on forces external to 
local management - i.e., socioeconomic conditions that 
are at once causes and symptoms of diminishing local 
service capacity and resources (see Kimhi, 2008), such 
as high and concentrated poverty, older building stocks, 
residential vacancies, high crime, deep-rooted regional 
changes, population loss and job loss. The column labeled 
“policy approach” captures the gist of the state’s approach 
to financially distressed communities and reinforces the 
causal theory behind the policy’s design. We also include 
information on the administration of the states’ policies. 
Here the focus is on the powers of key administrative actors 
and their bureaucratic location. In line with a great deal of 
research on policy analysis and the policymaking process, 
we structure Table 3 in a way that suggests that key state 
decisions on goals, administration and implementation flow 
from how responsibility for the problem is assigned - i.e., 
the causal story (see Stone, 2011, p. 206). This information 
is provided for the six states that were represented at the 
Detroit workshop - Michigan, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio - as well as for North 
Carolina, a state that frequently gains attention for the 
effectiveness of its intervention policy. 

CD Michigan's Local Financial 
Stability and Choice Actt A Brave 
New World for State Intervention 

The tenets of Michigan’s intervention policy have been 
well-documented in research reports and news media. 

After the governor declares a fiscal emergency, 22 four 
possible courses of action are available to a municipality, 23 
though local takeover by an emergency manager (EM) is 
the most common course of action. This allows a state- 
appointed manager to “act for and in the place and stead 
of the governing body and the office of chief administrative 
officer of the local government” and effectively grants this 
individual powers beyond those available to local officials. 24 
Not only does he or she become responsible for all local 
fiscal decisions, including development and implementation 
of a recovery plan (which must be approved by the state 
treasurer), but the EM can also modify existing collective 
bargaining agreements, negotiate new union contracts and 
make personnel changes. The EM can also explore the 
option of consolidating services with another government 
entity, sell municipal assets and ask voters to increase the 
tax rate. The EM remains in this role until the city reaches 
certain benchmarks within its recovery plan, and a

receivership transition board is appointed by the governor 
to assist in transition until the official termination of 
receivership. 

The structure of Michigan’s successive intervention laws 
and the powers granted to the emergency manager point 
to a particular type of causal story - local government 
mismanagement as the chief barrier to fiscal solvency. The 
state’s solutions and assistance all center on correcting 
local decisions that led to chronic budget shortfalls, and 
the main focus of Michigan’s law, which is administered by 
the Department of Treasury, is to ensure a balanced budget. 
Efforts to achieve short-term fiscal solvency typically center 
on reductions in cities’ financial obligations - e.g., cutting 
pension obligations, making personnel cuts and contracting 
out services traditionally provided by local governments. 
EMs and other state officials have little leeway to affect the 
revenue side of local governments’ ledgers. As Anderson 
(2011, p. 620) argues, the viewpoint being expressed by the 
design and implementation of Michigan’s policy is “that the 
current revenue picture of the city is adequate to provide 
for public safety, debt service, and other core expenses — if 
only ... the city had competent management.” Indeed, little 
or no financial support accompanies state takeover. This 
is a telling feature of the state law that sheds considerable 
light on both the degree to which the policy oversimplifies 
the causes of local fiscal distress and the mismatch between 
the administrator’s toolkit and the nature of the problem. 

To respond to the question at the outset of this section: if 
takeover is the solution, the problem is mismanagement. 
Michigan codifies this causal story in a way that is less 
adulterated than in any other state we have surveyed. In 
other words, the state has adopted and codified a vastly 
oversimplified story. Even Rhode Island, which granted 
similarly sweeping powers to its state-appointed emergency 
managers, offers additional assistance to cities approaching 
distress to help prevent full-fledged crises. The state 
has also seen EMs (called “receivers”) raise local taxes 
to generate more local revenue. This less than favorable 
assessment of Michigan’s policy is buttressed by the 
absence of emergency bailout funding, a traditional feature 
of the more aggressively implemented state intervention 
policies (Berman, 1995; Anderson, 2011), as well as meager 
revenue-raising powers. EMs are empowered to tackle 
city expenditures as a means of bringing local budgets into 
equilibrium, but revenue-raising powers are effectively 
more limited than the powers normally afforded a city’s 
mayor or council member. As has been pointed out 
elsewhere, for cities such as Flint, Ecorse, Benton Harbor 
and Pontiac, this is a gross oversimplification of the 
structural barriers to fiscal sustainability (Doidge et al., 
2015). Our aim in this report is not to disprove the notion 
that mismanagement is the cause. We merely point out that 
the policy’s design and implementation features devalue 
the considerable constraints that the state places on the 
revenue capacity of local officials. 


C2) Ttte Limited Applicability of 
ss B@st Practices**” Why Adoption of 
North €ar©IIna*s Policies Won*t Work 
for Michigan 

The reentry of Michigan’s cities into emergency 
management and the number of local governments and 
school districts in trouble have led to suggestions that 
Michigan should look elsewhere for answers. 25 A Pew 
Center on the States report suggests that North Carolina’s 
monitoring system has prevented fiscal distress despite a 
history of crises during the Great Depression and some of 
highest unemployment rates in the country (Pew Charitable 
Trusts, 2013). 

The Local Government Commission, a division of the North 
Carolina Treasury Department, reviews cities’ independent 
audits on key fiscal health indicators, particularly the 
level of fund balance. If a locality fails to meet a specific 
threshold, it is placed on the commission’s watch report 
and required to submit a plan of improvement. If local 
officials are unable to return the municipality to an 
acceptable level on their own, the commission assumes 
control of all local financial decisions, including taxing 
issues, until the problem is corrected. Additionally, the 
commission approves and sells all local bonds for public 
structure investments, which both increases the level 
of state oversight and reduces the potential for local 
mismanagement of debt. Bond agencies assign a premium 
to this monitoring system, considering it a model system 
(Coe, 2007). 

Features of North Carolina’s approach provide intriguing 
options for Michigan lawmakers, such as a codified, 
professional state office and extensive front-end monitoring 
to identify potential crises. However, evaluating these 
policies in isolation - i.e., in the absence of key contextual 
factors - is likely to overstate the potential success of North 
Carolina’s policies if they were to be enacted in Michigan. 

For instance, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2007, 
North Carolina had 548 municipalities, no other local 
general-purpose governments and 100 counties; Michigan 
had 533 cities and villages (municipalities), 1,242 townships 
and 83 counties. A consequence of Michigan having three 
times as many local governments as North Carolina is that 
the volume of reports that would need to be reviewed 
for monitoring purposes would be three times as great. 26 
Certainly this would require more resources devoted to 
oversight at the state level, thus putting additional stress on 
the state budget. 

The states differ greatly on other dimensions of the 
elements of state context identified in Section I. North 

25 http://www.crcmich.org/PUBLICAT/2000s/2000/memol053.pdf. 

26 This does not include the additional resources that would be required 
to monitor school districts, special districts or other governmental 
units. 


19 



Carolina has an obligatory state pension system; Michigan 
does not. In 1947, North Carolina declared it illegal for 
local governments to bargain with unions. 27 Conversely, 
Michigan’s local governments have a strong history of 
collective bargaining and excluded police and fire unions 
from 2012’s right-to-work legislation. Tax and expenditure 
limits, when averaged from 1970 through 2005, rank 
Michigan as the third most restrictive state in limits placed 
on local governments. North Carolina is 38 th - a property 
tax rate limit on counties and municipalities, set in 1973, 
has remained its only TEL. 

The differences in the state policy context between the 
two states suggest that Michigan should be cautious 
when drawing lessons from North Carolina as its model 
for intervention policies. We attribute North Carolina’s 
success in preventing municipalities from entering distress 
not to the design of its specific intervention policy but 
rather to a much tighter link between its policy approach 
and the state-imposed context for fiscal distress. 

C3) Hebyildlng State-Leeai 
Partnerships" ICey Insights 
from Piiede island* New jersey* 
Pennsylvania* Mew Yorlc and Ohio 

One of the more striking findings to emerge from our 
workshop and subsequent research is the difference 
between Michigan’s approach to local fiscal distress and 
the approaches of comparably situated state governments. 
These differences are laid bare in Table 3. Plainly put, state 
policies and institutions effectively incubate budgetary 
imbalances; yet lawmakers and administrators have ignored 
potential front-end damage when designing the policy 
aimed at helping communities in distress. Rhode Island, 
the state most comparable to Michigan in the priorities 
of its intervention policy and the powers granted to state 
receivers, also provides financial assistance to municipalities 
most in need, targeting aid to communities with a high 
property tax burden relative to taxpayer wealth through the 
state’s Distressed Communities Relief Fund thus buttressing 
the revenue capacity of its local governments. 28 With 
respect to this specific aspect of state context, Rhode Island 
generally provides higher levels of state aid. 

New Jersey and Pennsylvania: A More 
Comprehensive View of Local Financial 
Failure 

Beyond Rhode Island, Michigan lawmakers have a variety of 
states from which to learn about the viability of policy 


27 N.C. Gen. Stat. 95-78 to 84 (http://www.nrtw.org/right-work-states-

28 Established in 1990. Municipalities that fall in the bottom 20 percent 
of three of the law’s four indices qualify to receive state aid under the 
law. In the 2014 fiscal year, seven municipalities received funding

alternatives. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have enacted 
receivership laws that are quite different than Michigan and 
Rhode Island. Internal mismanagement is not eschewed 
entirely; rather it is considered alongside the external, 
structural dynamics with which local lawmakers must 
contend. This more holistic causal story both reinforces 
and is reinforced by choices that these states have made 
regarding implementation and administration. 

New Jersey’s policy of assisting cities during times of 
financial crisis originated in the Great Depression. Since 
that time, the state has built support within its bureaucracy 
to review and approve city budgets and offer financial 
and technical assistance as needed to prevent cities from 
entering bankruptcy. Rather than appointing a state- 
level official to take charge of a city' s finances (such as an 
emergency manager in Michigan), 29 Newjersey seeks to 
assist local officials in alleviating distress. This partnership 
is reflected in the mission statement of the Newjersey 
Division of Local Government Services (DLGS), a division 
of the Department of Community Affairs. It states that 
the DLGS “serves as an advocate for local Government 
interests,” provides assistance and is responsible for 
“financial integrity.” The DLGS provides advisory services 
to local governments, both once the community is identified 
as distressed and on request of the municipality, and also 
licenses and educates local officials. 

Not surprisingly, these two services help establish a 
partnership between state and local officials independent 
of the financial position of the municipality. The state 
requires that all local government budgets and certain 
financing and purchases be approved by state agencies. 30 
The budget review is conducted by department staff 
members (many hired short-term annually) and is made 
easier for local units of government by state-provided 
training and consistent reporting requirements. When 
these preventive actions fail to ward off systemic financial 
issues, the state begins a more involved intervention. The 
community is first placed on a watch list, at which point 
the state generally channels additional monetary aid to the 
struggling government. The state also uses its Qualified 
Bond Act Program, which requires state approval to bond or 
make capital expenditures, to ensure stability and prevent 
default. This program can capture and stall state aid for 
payment of debt services. At the same time, DLGS offers 
technical assistance to cities to help them solve underlying 
problems that contribute to fiscal distress. 

The most notable example is the consolidation of the 
Camden police force in 2010. The mayor terminated the 
entire city police force and contracted with the county 
to provide those services, with the guidance and support 


29 Until recently, when Atlantic City was declared to be in fiscal distress 
and an emergency manager was appointed. 

30 Procurements over $5 million must be reviewed by the comptroller, 
and those over $10 million must be directly approved. 



of state officials. 31 Camden illustrates the cooperative 
efforts of various levels and sectors of the state and local 
governments. It highlights that preventive efforts to 
maintain or restore fiscal sustainability are not always 
sufficient, but that a collaborative approach can assist cities 
and the state through difficult political decisions. New 
Jersey’s approach indicates that the state views itself in 
partnership with local governments, with a responsibility 
to provide a check on risky financial decisions but also 
to provide ongoing financial assistance to struggling 
communities. 

In contrast to New Jersey’s hesitance to use direct state 
control, Pennsylvania’s Act 47 allows the state to place 
fiscally distressed communities in receivership under the 
direction of the Center for Local Government Services in 
the Department of Community and Economic Development. 
Once a municipality has been placed under receivership, 
local government officials must have the majority of their 
decisions confirmed by the receiver, and the receivership 
board may implement cost-saving or revenue-raising 
strategies unavailable to local officials. The board has the 
ability to raise taxes above the legal maximum but has no 
additional powers in collective bargaining. Principally, 
the receiver acts as a liaison between the local government 
and others to improve the financial integrity of the city and 
is typically able to broker additional state funding for the 
distressed community. In Harrisburg’s recent financial 
descent, for instance, the receiver was able to facilitate $25 
million of revenue to fund a non-profit that would provide 
infrastructure and economic development. 

Receivers in Pennsylvania tend to take a comprehensive 
view of local financial difficulties as they work with the 
state to look for alternative partnerships and unique 
revenue-enhancing and cost-sharing schemes. Proposed 
financial recovery plans often include recommendations 
that will improve local governments’ economic positions 
in the future. This approach extends through the process 
of recovery. It requires more research, more interactions 
and coordination between parties, and more time to allow 
for business adjustments and industrial reorganization. 
Furthermore, it includes a period of weaning cities off the 
additional funding to which they had access during their 
most trying times. To officially exit Act 47, cities must 
follow an extensive process that includes hearings and the 
department director’s signature. As a result, Pennsylvania 
has had only seven of 28 distressed communities officially 
conclude the process. Allowing cities to remain in a 
system with additional structure and support illustrates 
Pennsylvania’s acknowledgement that factors outside of 
local control contribute to fiscal issues, and that the state 
has some role in providing additional support. 

31 Returning to the role of other state policies in distress solutions, this 
action would not have been possible without particular provisions 
within union and employee contracts that allowed for such termination 
of individual employees. 


In all, intervention policies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania 
are administered by state agencies dedicated to working 
with local governments. State personnel are involved 
with municipalities well before distress, and they have 
resources and authority to assist municipalities. Though 
administrators are afforded the statutory authority to 
assume greater control over city finances, this is not the 
only facet of their relationship with local governments. 

New York and Ohio: The Benefits of 
Monitoring 

Similar to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, New York 
has established a system that supports state and local 
cooperation and information sharing. As local fiscal 
crisis deepens, the state becomes more involved in 
local political and operational affairs. The state’s policy 
approach to local fiscal emergencies is ad hoc\ (rather 
than multijurisdictional), allowing lawmakers to survey 
the specific causes of distress for a given community and 
legislate solutions in line with these problems. 

As is well-documented, New York’s history of fiscal 
intervention begins with New York City’s near bankruptcy 
in 1975. Naturally, a crisis of that magnitude spurred state 
action, but since that time, New York has not been plagued 
by chronic distress. This is due in part to cities’ ability 
to increase revenues without legal restriction (until 2014, 
when the state imposed a cap on property tax increases). 
Additionally, many New York communities have avoided 
the economic peril that results from a loss of major 
industries and subsequent economic restructuring. 32 This 
history is evident in the state’s view of municipal distress 
as an unusual and unique instance that requires customized 
solutions. New York provides gradual intervention and 
individualized approaches to distress, with the decisions 
and the process supervised by state elected officials - the 
governor, the legislature and the comptroller. 

In addition to customized intervention approaches to 
distressed cities - which could violate the constitutions 
of states that disallow special legislation - New York is 
also heavily involved in monitoring the fiscal position of 
its local governments. The state’s Local Government and 
School Accountability (LGSA) unit of the Office of the State 
Comptroller operates the Fiscal Stress Monitoring System, 
which reviews annual financial data of local governments to 
determine whether each government is facing significant, 
moderate or probable fiscal stress. Municipalities must 
submit audit reports, which are reviewed and in some 
cases conducted by approximately 200 auditors. 33 From 
annual reports, budgets and audits, the LGSA creates 
local fiscal measures for benchmarking, trend analysis and 

32 Buffalo was an exception and did necessitate intervention proceedings. 
It should be noted that Buffalo is one of only four New York local 
governments responsible for operating its own school district. 

33 These 200 employees review audit reports of school districts and other 
local governments as well as municipalities. 



general monitoring over time and across local government 
types. State auditors are also deployed to work with local 
governments. As a result, state officials may use knowledge 
of community nuances in evaluating local deviations 
from sound fiscal indicators and state trends. Such 
specialization is particularly useful as state intervention 
becomes necessary. 34 

If a local government is identified as financially unsound, 
the state must pass special legislation to institute a local 
control board for the municipality to engage in the formal 
intervention process. After a local control board is created, 
primary authority over the struggling municipality is 
transferred from the comptroller’s office to the governor' 
appointed board. 

Each board, by the nature of the process, has different 
powers. Previous boards have overseen proposed local 
budgets and set personnel policy, and were granted the 
final authority to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 35 That 
the boards have had no additional taxing authority, ability 
to renegotiate previous collective bargaining agreements 
nor authority to make unilateral budget decisions reflects 
the state’s emphasis on local autonomy. 

The boards have been particularly useful in coordinating 
intergovernmental solutions. For instance, the Buffalo 
Fiscal Stability Authority (BFSA) was established in 2003. 

It helped Buffalo manage its additional school district 
responsibility and restructured the city’s pension and 
health insurance plans by joining the respective state- 
level systems. Finally, the BFSA brokered an arrangement 
for city parks to be managed at the county level and for 
16 libraries to close. Despite the local knowledge and 
intergovernmental efforts, it took nearly nine years for 
Buffalo to exit receivership and for the BFSA to transition 
into an advisory role. Policy specifies that the BFSA will 
serve in this role until 2037, and the city may revert to full 
receivership if financial indicators show distress. 

At the state level, New York vests its relationship with 
local governments and the power to intervene in elected 
officials - the governor, the comptroller and the legislature. 
This separates the state’s ongoing monitoring from its 
intervention, and though it raises the legislative barrier 
to intervention by requiring the crafting and passage of 
legislation, it also provides public accountability and a 
system of checks and balances. The ability to draft city- 
specific solutions allows New York to address management 
issues, economic conditions and the impacts of the state 

34 Ultimately, any distressed community implements solutions that are 
specific to its condition. A universal policy prescription is to reduce 
expenditures. However, no universal prescription can be made 

on what account specifically should be limited and in what way. 
Knowledge of exact inefficiencies, redundancies, slack and so forth is 
necessary to act. If outside agents are to advise on such actions, their 
already having some knowledge of the particulars of the city will allow 
for more expedient and implementable recommendations. 

35 Control boards are not granted this authority for New York City.

context in different ways in each city, ideally assisting the 
community to long-term stability. 

Ohio, like New York, faced a fiscal crisis in its largest city 
in the 1970s. Cleveland’s default on short-term notes in 
1978, which made it the first municipality to default since 
the Great Depression, led Ohio to develop a comprehensive 
policy designed to prevent and, if necessary, intervene 
in distressed cities (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2013; Levine, 
Scorsone and Justice, 2013). No municipality has defaulted 
since Cleveland, but Toledo, East Cleveland and other 
municipalities have entered fiscal emergency status, 
particularly once the Great Recession exacerbated declining 
revenue bases and expenditure pressures. 

Ohio’s Local Government Services Division, located in the 
state auditor’s office, is responsible for training local officials 
and auditing local budgets. Chapter 118 of the state code, 36 
which deals with local fiscal emergencies, grants the Local 
Government Services Division (the auditor) responsibility 
for categorizing distressed communities for fiscal caution, 
fiscal watch or fiscal emergency. The categorization system 
signals to local officials, bondholders and other stakeholders 
the extent of the local government’s fiscal stress and the 
ease of financial recovery anticipated. It serves as a useful 
continuum of distress, recognizing that failing to pass one 
indicator of financial soundness may not require the same 
actions as a community failing multiple triggers. Each category 
has an increasing level of oversight (i.e., requirements for audit 
depth and financial plan proposals). Once fiscal emergency is 
declared, an advisory board is created. 

Under all three distress categories, local governments are 
required to submit recovery plans to the Local Government 
Services Division. If a local government is not compliant 
with its recovery plan, the only penalty is movement 
to a higher designation of fiscal distress. It is not until 
a municipality reaches the fiscal emergency status that 
penalties are imposed. 

As part of the fiscal emergency proceedings, municipal 
officials must submit a recovery plan to the recovery 
board for approval. If a plan is not submitted or the local 
government fails to adhere to a plan, the Office of Budget 
and Management is supposed to suspend all state funding 
to that municipality, 37 though this penalty has never been 
fully enforced. 

36 The other elements comprising the law became effective, were revised 
or added in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2002 - http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/118 
(pdf). The state’s approach is consistent with the autonomy allowed 
Ohio’s local governments. Section 118.02 (B) of the state code states 
that, “[t]he intention...is to enact procedures, provide powers, and 
impose restrictions ...while leaving principal responsibility for the 
conduct of the affairs...in the charge of its duly elected officials.” The 
effort to maintain local autonomy is demonstrated by the fact that the 
review process of the Local Government Services Division is initiated 
by request of local officials as well as at the suggestion of auditors. 

37 Although individuals receiving direct state welfare within the 
community’s borders continue to do so. 




Ohio, like other states, struggles with assisting 
communities to achieve permanent fiscal stability. The city 
of East Cleveland was under fiscal emergency for 18 years. 
Exiting the process failed to mark long-term sustainable 
success - East Cleveland was once again placed under 
fiscal emergency. In late 2014, it was considering entering 
into bankruptcy proceedings, 38 and the city’s mayor filed a 
petition seeking a merger with the city of Cleveland in the 
summer of 2015. 39

Ohio, like Michigan, illustrates the issues that arise when 
a state’s solution (intervention policy) does not match the 
causes of distress (context). Local officials retain control of 
decision making and the plan to resolve distress, but they 
and the state agency responsible for intervention lack the 
authority or resources to address the root causes of distress 
or to circumvent the pressures that the mix of state policies 
adds to local fiscal policymaking processes.

Section 3: Conclusions and 
Recommendations 


In the previous sections we identified the ways that broad 
state policies limit or enhance the local governing options 
and the ways that states with intervention policies match 
their approach to local financial distress with the reality 
of city operating environments. Here we conclude our 
analysis with conclusions and practical recommendations 
to assist the C.S. Mott Foundation, state and local officials, 
and Michigan residents in identifying a more effective 
approach to local fiscal crises. 

CIIJ Conciysions 

There is no single model policy for state intervention 
in distressed cities or for prevention of fiscal distress. 
Changing Michigan’s fiscal intervention law to replicate 
that of another state would likely provide little 
improvement for Flint or other cities facing fiscal crises. 
There is no “best practice” for state intervention in cities. 
What Michigan can learn from other states and our research 
is that removing and repairing mismanagement addresses 
only one cause of fiscal distress. Bringing a structurally 
imbalanced budget back into balance is an important step 
to assist cities like Flint, but a policy that does not address 
a state’s unique system of revenue, tax and expenditures, 
and labor policies may not help cities truly escape financial 
trouble over the long term. States must decide which legal 
and political tradeoffs they are willing to make to support 
city fiscal health. Michigan must also recognize that, in 
comparison with similar states, it provides a particularly 
difficult environment for its cities. 

Municipal fiscal distress is not just a local problem. State 
policy choices set the boundaries for local action and the 
conditions under which cities receive assistance. It is not 
surprising that these conclusions do not point to simple 
solutions, executable at the local level. Changing any one 
part of the state context is politically challenging, and it 
would be impractical to recommend major policy overhauls 
of Proposal A, the Headlee Amendment, collective 
bargaining rules and state revenue sharing. Ideally, 
Michigan would adopt a more balanced approach to its 
local governments’ fiscal needs, but we are aware that this 
is unlikely in the short term because of both political will 
and the high barriers to changing constitutionally enshrined 
rules. Instead, we offer recommendations that balance 
improvements that would better support cities in fiscal 
distress with political feasibility. 

Mec@mmenoaii©iis 

Create a state agency that coordinates services to local 
governments and offers technical support and fiscal 


monitoring. Establishing a formal place within state 
government that is responsible for ongoing, cooperative 
work with local governments on fiscal stability and other 
issues would help create a partnership and culture of trust 
between the state and its municipalities. The Department 
of Treasury does provide some of these services on an 
individual basis via the Office of Fiscal Responsibility 
(OFR), but the OFR does not have the resources necessary 
to provide a comprehensive system of support to all of the 
state’s local governments. 

It is important that whatever agency is created be 
empowered with human resources to sufficiently provide 
service; financial resources, separate from the state’s 
revenue sharing to local governments, to offer special 
assistance where needed to communities facing challenges 
or distress; and a position within the state departmental 
structure that allows it to be taken seriously when 
recommending policy and working with other departments 
to assist local governments. The examples of offices in 
the other states in our study may provide elements of 
the agency’s design, but the office should be built with 
Michigan’s particular context and culture in mind. It may 
be appropriate to expand the OFR in its current position, 
but moving the office to another department, establishing 
it as a stand-alone agency and other potential structures 
should be evaluated as well. 

Raise awareness among citizens and state decision makers 
that the causes of fiscal distress are not solely at the local 
level. Flint is an example that can illustrate this point as 
the C.S. Mott Foundation and city leaders communicate 
with the public and state officials. As the city emerges from 
state control, the budget is balanced for the short term, 
and the transition advisory board is in place to monitor 
management and compliance with the plan. Yet revenue 
projections show the city likely facing a structural deficit 
in the next five years with little available to cut from the 
budget. State control has reasonably removed management 
problems as the cause of deficits, yet the city’s fiscal 
health remains precarious. A focused communications 
effort highlighting the combined effects of Michigan’s 
expenditure, revenue and labor policies could help broaden 
the discussion of fiscal distress in the state and create 
awareness that this is more than a local problem. Rather 
than being the exception, Flint may be the harbinger of 
what is to come for Michigan’s local governments without 
changes at the state level.

policy distance between state aid environ- 
monl and state-imposed TEL restrictions. 
State aid and TEL z scores were calculated 
for each state year. (These standardize the 
relationship to Lhe average of ail states and 
all years and represent how many standard 
deviations a score is from the average.) 

The aid measure is per capita state aid in 
real 2005 dollars for cities with populations 
over 5,000. The TEL measure is the TEL se- 
verity score described above. These scores 
were then differenced (Aid_z minus TEL_z 
in Figure 5; TEt_z minus Aid_z for Figure 6 
and Table 2) to create the distance mea- 
sure. The values displayed are the average 
distances from 2000 through 2005. Carrot 
states are 1.5 standard deviations above the 
mean difference; stick states are 1.5 stan- 
dard deviations below 'the mean different e

We invited three types of individuals to participate in the Workshop on State Intervention in Distressed 
Communities held at Detroit’s Grccktown Hotel and Casino October 16-17, 2014: individuals who were for- 
mally involved in various elements of state intervention policy design and implementation, those involved 
in local fiscal distress and bankruptcy from a legal standpoint, and policy experts and researchers. The 
following table classifies the participants.

Session Title 


Outline 

Setting the Context |||!!!!!|| 

Surveying the causes and consequences of local fiscal dis- 
tress, with particular attention to the relatively weak posi- 
tion of local governments in the U.S, federal system: 

• Review of structural, economic, fiscal, intergovern- 
mental, institutional, and political causes 

• Local governments’ response to fiscal distress 

• State policies/institutions’ role in local fiscal capaci- 
ty 

• State policies designed to help local governments 
meet their financial problems 

State Intervention in Distressed Com- 
munities: The View From Michigan 

An in-depth view of Michigan’s approach to local fiscal 
distress through the eyes of those closely involved in the 
policy's design, implementation, and evolution 

A Deep Dive Into State Intervention: 
Policies on Paper v. Policies in Prac- 
tice 

A structured dialogue about the participants’ experiences 
with key elements of state intervention. 

• Stage 1: Getting in 

Where and when is pre-intervention support of- 
fered? How are distressed localities identified? 
When and how do local governments enter the 
program? How are decision criteria applied? 

* Stage 2: Developing a plan 

Who carries out the intervention? What actions 
may these actors take? What are the specific goals 
of intervention? What are the chief barriers to ef- 
fective implementation? 

♦ Stage J Exit strategy 

How does a local government exit the program? 
Are triggers well specified? When, if ever, are 
medium- and long-term fiscal, economic, or ser- 
vice-based objectives discussed?

Introduction 


The city of Flint, Michigan, has experienced a variety of fiscal 
difficulties since the early 2000s. In. 2002, an emergency 
financial manager was appointed for the city under Public 
Act 72 of 1990 and was in place until 2004. Unfortunately, 
the reforms and changes made at that time only lasted for 
a few years before fiscal problems re-emerged in Flint (see 
MSU Extension, white paper Long-Term Crisis and Systemic Failure: 
Taking the Fiscal Stress of America’s Older Cities Seriously). By 2011, 
a second wave of emergency managers would be named to 
run the city under two newer laws (including PA 4 of 2011 
and PA 436 of 2012). These emergency managers were 
removed from the city, restoring home rule in April 2015. The 
key question; Can Flint avoid the problems that have plagued 
it for the last 15 years without being placed under state 
control for the third time? Before answering that question, we 
must understand the reforms and changes that have occurred 
in the city since a fiscal emergency' was declared in 2011. 


The objectives of this case study of Flint, Michigan., are 
to understand the economic and fiscal trends that led to 
the state takeover via an emergency financial manager in. 
November 2011 and to analyze the impact of the emergency 
manager policy on the city’s fiscal health. It updates trends 
presented in a previous case study on. fiscal stress in Flint, 3 
provides additional detail regarding the policy changes that 
emergency managers have made, and examines the impacts 
of those changes.

II. Historical Overview of Flint, Michigan 


Examining the history of Flint can provide an. 
understanding of the evolution of the chronic fiscal stress 
that has plagued the. city, as well as its significance in the 
geographic region. The city of Flint is located in Genesee 
County, about 60 miles northwest of Detroit. The Flint 
River provided the natural, resources to create successful 
commerce in the 1800s for fur trading, the lumber industry, 
the manufacture of carriages, and eventually the production 
of horseless carriages that led to the birth of the automotive 
industry. The entrepreneurial spirit and wealth in the area 
contributed to the founding of the Buick Motor Company 
in .1903, followed by the incorporation of General Motors 
(GM) in 1908. With the rapid growth of the automotive 
industry came concerns for employee working conditions. 
This led to the first automotive sit-down strike in 1936-1937 
in Flint. After 44 days, the strike ended with the first union 
agreement with GM, which gave rise to the United. Auto 
Workers (UAW). The continued improvements in working 
conditions and wages enabled Flint to become an ideal 
place to live and work, and the increase in wealth fostered 
a well-respected educational system. Early automotive 
industry leaders such as Charles Stewart Mott and William 
C. Durant provided the vision to create a strong cultural 
environment. Flint prospered for most of the years from 
the 1930s into the early 1970s. Like many industrial cities, 
however, the economic vibrancy ebbed and flowed with 
the U.S. automotive industry. In 1978, GM employed 


over 80,000 Flint-area residents. By 1990, the number of 
employees decreased to 23,000, dipping to as low as 8,000 
in 2006.

The City of Flint was incorporated in 1855. The present 
charter, adopted in 1974, provides for a strong mayor- 
council form of government. The city council consists of 
nine members, each representing a ward and serving four- 
year terms. The mayor, also elected to a four-year term, 
is the chief executive officer. The mayor appoints a city 
administrator, as well as principal officials and department 
heads. 

The City' of Flint: provides a full range of services across 
32.8 square miles, including: police and fire protection, 
construction and maintenance of streets and infrastructure, 
recreational and cultural activities, water and sewer 
services, and sanitation and garbage pickup services. In 
addition, the City of Flint is financially accountable for four 
other entities: 

► City of Flint Board of Hospital Managers (manages and 
operates the Hurley Medical. Center providing inpatient, 
outpatient, and emergency care) 

> Flint Downtown Development Authority (promotes 
rehabilitation of the downtown area) 


Z 



> City of Flint Economic Development Corporation (provides financing and 
development opportunities for businesses located in the City) 

* Flint Area Enterprise Community 4 5 (coordinates the federal enterprise and 
helps to leverage the resources for the zone) 

Flint is the county seat for Genesee County. Like most counties in Michigan, the 
county government provides court services, human services, record keeping, and 
community enrichment for its residents. The. county and its elected officials also 
serve as regional problem solvers. 

Diimofgifiipliiss 

The city of Flint’s population has changed drastically over the past 50 years. 

This section explores the historical changes that have occurred throughout the 
city and region. These trends are essential for explaining the path that has led to 
Flint’s fiscal distress and may point to the path that the city may need to follow 
in order to build a sustainable future. 


According to data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the 
city of Flint has declined over five consecutive decades. There were 48% fewer 
residents in the city in 2010 compared to 1960 (Exhibit 11-1). In 2012, there were 
100,515 s residents in the city; in 2013 the city’s estimated population further 
declined to 99,758 6 . 

In contrast, the population trends in the Flint metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA), defined by Genesee County boundaries, indicate enormous growth 
through, the 1970s with slight declines over the following three decades. This 
indicates that the Flint metropolitan statistical area has experienced significant: 
decentralization.

Exhibit U-2 more clearly illustrates this decentralization. In 1940, the city of 
Flint comprised 66% of the population of the Flint MSA population compared 
to only 24% in 20.13. The estimates from the 20B American Community Survey 
indicate that the net migration into the suburbs may be starting to stabilize, 
though Flint’s population has continued to decline in recent years.

To see this more clearly, Exhibit H-4 shows the relative share of each age 
category in the total population for each year. The share of population aged 19 
years old and under generally increased from .1.940 to 1970 with the Baby Boom 
and has since continually declined from its peak of 41% in 1970. to only 29% of 
the population in 2013. The share of individuals aged 20 to 34 has fluctuated over 
the last seven decades, but has been on a general decline since 1980. The share 
of population aged 35 to 64 years old experienced a period of contraction from 
1950 to 1980 followed by a continuous period of growth since then, likely due to 
the aging of the Baby Boomer population. Finally, during the past, seven decades, 
there, has been a fairly steady expansion of residents aged 65 and. over, probably 
due to increased life expectancy. This demographic is expected to continue to 
expand with the aging of the Baby Boomer population. 

The racial distribution of the city has also changed since the 1940s, as shown in 
Exhibit iI-5. The city has become more diverse with a population that is 39% 
white and 56% bl a ck/A fri ca r; -Am erican in 2012 compared to 95.6% white and 
4% black/African-American in 1940. The share of the population in the “Other” 
category, which includes both individuals of other races and multi-racial 
individuals, has also grown from 0.1% in 1940 to 6% in 2010.

Housing trends also help tell the story of a city that is facing fiscal stress. The 
rate, of housing vacancy increased from 5.1% in 1970 to 25.4 % in 2013 (Exhibit 
11-8). The rate of change in vacancy was highest between 2000 and 2013 with 
a 13 percentage-point increase. This coincides with Michigan’s decade of 
economic decline. The potential impact of increased housing vacancies on fiscal 
health include not only decline in property values and associated property 
tax revenues, but also increased municipal maintenance, police patrol, fire 
protection, and other costs to address health and human safety concerns.' 

Home ownership is also associated with the strength of a community’s property 
values. In 2013, owner-occupied housing only comprised 57% of occupied 
housing units compared to 73% of units at its peak over the last seven decades 
in 1960. However, the rate of owner-occupied housing in 2013 is a slight increase 
from its value in 2010, perhaps a small sign of recovery for the city of Flint 
(Exhibit 81-7).

Given these trends, it is no surprise that property values in the Flint area have 
declined drastically since the Great Recession as shown in Exhibit US. The 
state equalized value (SEV) and the taxable value (TV) have almost converged as 
of 2015. This could be attributed to a combination of falling property values and 
the “pop-up” effect of the transfer of ownership of property due to Proposal A 
(which will be discussed in more detail in section IV). Since local governments 
tend to rely heavily on property taxes for revenue, this is another indicator of the 
declining tax base of the city. 


The trends in the jobless rate in the city of Flint and Flint MSA tend to follow 
the same pattern as that of Michigan as a whole (Exhibit Ii-9). The jobless rate 
rose during the 2001 recession and did not see sustained recovery until after the 
Great Recession ended in 2009; however, absolute unemployment rates tend to 
be higher in the city compared to the MSA and the state as a whole. While there 
has been a drop in unemployment in the city of Flint since the end of the Great 
Recession, it is still higher (14% in 2014) than pre-2001 recession levels (8% in 
2000 ).

The city of Flint’s audit reports disclosed the city’s personal income statistics 
as shown in Exhibit li-10. While a slight recovery occurred after the 2001 
recession, in general, personal income has been on a long-term decline since 
1996, indicating a diminishing tax base. A decline in personal income not only 
indicates a lower capacity for property tax and income tax. revenues, but also 
suggests a relation to a lower demand for business-type services. If this demand 
is fairly elastic with respect to personal income, this would lead to a reduction in 
city income from public recreation programs, parking fees, and similar sources. 
The decline in personal income began leveling off in 2009, suggesting signs of 
stabilization following Michigan’s decade in recession. 

While the economic climate in the 1990s and 2000s worsened the city of Flint’s 
employment: and income trends, many decades of above average poverty rates 
signal long-term fiscal stress. Exhibit 18-11 shows the general growth in the 
share of total population living below the poverty level, which peaked at 41.2% 
in 2010. The share of families below the poverty level follows the population 
trend. Poverty rates reported by the 2012 American Community Survey indicate

a possible improvement since 2010, which also coincides with the improvements 
in unemployment; and income, discussed above. If the unemployment 
and income trends are indeed indicative of economic recovery, then these 
improvements in poverty statistics are possibly explained by a countercyclical, 
relationship between poverty and the business cycle. 

Exhibit I M2 depicts the cumulative change in the number of nonfarm, jobs 
in the city of Flint, the Flint: MSA, and Michigan as a whole. While the state 
overall saw a period of growth in employment in the mid-1990s, employment 
in the city of Flint and the Flint: MSA began to decline in 1996. According to 
annual estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the Flint MSA., the 
decline in manufacturing was the driving force of unemployment. Employment 
in dais sector consistently fell between 1995 and 2008, from 48,200 jobs to 
9,500/ Over this same period, the share, of manufacturing jobs (of total nonfarm 
employment) dropped from 27% to 9%. This trend is likely due to the region’s 
reliance on the domestic auto industry and the declines in the Big Three’s 
market share that began in the 1980s and led to plant closures in the 1990s and 
early 2000s. According to Genesee County’s audit reports, the county’s largest 
employer in FY.1997 was GM with 40,944 employees. In FY2009, GM still held 
its rank as the county’s largest employer, but with only 3,417 employees in the 
county. 

While the Flint MSA saw a boost in jobs in 2000, the city experienced a long- 
term decline in employment over the period shown, with 39% fewer jobs in 
2014 than existed in 1995. The share of employment in the city compared to the 
MSA as a whole also fell in the same time period; as of 20.1.4, employees in Flint 
represent about 18% of those in the Flint: MSA compared to 26% in 1995. 

The trends in Exhibit li~12 indicate that employment started to recover 
slightly in 20,10. This has been primarily driven by the private sector, namely the 
manufacturing, professional and business services, and trade, transportation 
and utilities sub-sectors. Public sector employment in the region has followed 
national trends as It continues to decline. The overall rise in employment in Flint 
along with the unemployment, income, and poverty trends support the story 
that the city is experiencing signs of economic, recovery.

The industries representing the city’s 10 largest employers have diversified over 
the past decade. Most notable is the increased prevalence of higher education 
and employment services (Exhibit 0-13), During periods of economic decline, 
enrollment: in higher education often increases as individuals seek to expand 
their skill sets or pursue career changes. Demand for job placement services 
also increases. Another trend is the increasing concentration of employees in 
the top 10 employers. The 10 largest employers represented about 65% of the 
total number of employees in 2014 compared to only 59% of the total number 
of employees in 2003. This indicates that the impact of smaller firms in the city 
has diminished over this period. Larger firms tend to have more organizational 
slack, 11 which can act as a buffer during economic downturns. Smaller firms 
that; do not have such slack are likely more vulnerable to poor economic 
environments. Depending on the nature of recovery, employment in small firms 
could diminish even further during future recessions. 

Exhibit ii-14 illustrates the diversification of employment in the city of Flint by 
comparing the share of employees in each industry in 2003 and 2014. The relative 
share of both, automotive employment atid public sector employment dropped 
more significantly than that of healthcare employment.

The city has concentrated efforts to encourage new development. Although most 
new projects include property that is either tax exempt or requires a property 
tax incentive, they have brought employees to the city, which increases the 
nonresident income tax revenue. Recent redevelopment efforts have focused 
on marketing the 452-3 ere vacant “Buick City” property. The Environmental 
Protection Agency has committed up to $7 million for Phase I clean-up of that 
property.™ The total commitment to Buick City is approximately $30 million. 
Funding for the remediation is from the Revitalizing Auto Communities 
Environmental Response (RACER) Trust that wws created through the GM 
bankruptcy. The soil remediation project began in early 2011. According to the 
March 2014 update, corrective measures are being implemented in the Southend 
site. A corrective measures proposal for the Northend cleanup is being reviewed 
and will be presented to the public in summer 20142' 

In November 2013, the American Cast Iron Pipe Company announced plans to 
construct a plant on the Buick City property, creating 50 to 60 manufacturing 
jobs for Flint. The plant opened in December 2014. 

Flint’s air transportation needs are serviced by nearby Bishop International 
Airport, in January 2011, the Bishop Airport Board approved the bid process for 
a $16.8 million expansion. v This project added 47,000 square feet of terminal 
space, four gates and doubled the width of the corridor linking two sections of 
the airport. The expansion was completed in November 2012, adding 350 jobs 
and increasing the number of passengers at Flint’s Bishop International Airport”’ 1 . 
Several highways meet road transportation needs.

Due to its decreasing population, employment, and tax 
revenues, the Flint city government has been under 
considerable fiscal stress in recent years. In the early 2000s, 
an. emergency financial manager (EFM) was appointed for 
the city, and was in place until 2004; however, the city soon 
returned to fiscal insolvency. 

The cycle of returning to a deficit position after an EFM 
appointment ends is not unique to Flint. Drawing on the 
experience of Flint and other cities that have been assigned 
an EFM, state policy makers drafted revisions to PA 72, 
which was replaced by PA 4 in 2011. After a referendum, PA 
4 was repealed in. 2012, then replaced by PA 436 of 2012 s . 

The new law provides greater incentive and mechanisms 
for local governments to address budget challenges before 
an emergency manager (EM) is assigned. PA 436 also 
provides four options to struggling municipalities 9 , offering 
alternatives to the appointment of an EM. Ultimately, 
however, if cities with chronic fiscal stress are. suffering 
from structural challenges beyond their control, improved 
management will only be able to cure a limited number of 
problems. 

If a city is placed in receivership under PA 436 of 2012 
and an EM is appointed by the state, he or she is granted 
broad, powers to address the struggling city’s finances. 

This includes the authority to amend collective bargaining 
agreements, make personnel changes, and review 7 and 
approve the city’s budget. 

Responding to the most recent fiscal crisis, Michigan’s 
Treasury Department conducted, a preliminary review of 
Flint’s financial, situation in August and September 2011. 

™ The review found that general fund expenditures had 
exceeded revenues for the preceding four years. Two years 
after its deficit reduction plan had been submitted to the 
state, the general fund deficit had more than doubled. The 
review also reported that departments within the municipal 
government had been compensating for cash shortages by 
borrowing from other funds. The review 7 team determined 


8 Emergency financial managers were in place, under Act 72; the. term 
“emergency manager” is used in PA 4 and PA 436. There, are somewhat 
different powers under the various acts but otherwise the. concept is the 
same. 

8 These options include entering into a consent, agreement, with the 
state, filing for bankruptcy, agreeing to mediation, or accepting the 
appointment of an EM. 


it was uncertain whether the City of Flint would be able to 
fulfill its short-term financial obligations. 

Due to the City of Flint’s structural deficit, increasing 
legacy costs, and accumulating debt, the review 7 team, 
recommended to the governor that the city be. placed under 
emergency financial, management under Public Act 4. In 
November 2011, the governor of Michigan placed, the City of 
Flint in receivership. 

Michael Brown was appointed as the city’s emergency 
financial manager effective December 1, 2011. In August 
2012, Michael Brown w 7 as replaced by Edward Kurtz as 
emergency manager (who had served as the city’s EM from 
2002 to 2004). Ed Kurtz served as the city’s emergency 
manager until July 2013, at which time Michael Brow r n was 
again appointed by the governor. Michael Brown resigned 
in September 2013; Darnell Earley w 7 as appointed as his 
replacement. In January 2015, it was announced that. Jerry 
Ambrose, w 7 ho had previously served as the. city’s finance 
and administration director, would replace Darnell Earley 
as emergency manager. Jerry Ambrose, served as the city’s 
EM until April. 20.15, when control of the city’s finances 
was returned to the mayor and city council under the 
supervision of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. 

Reforms to Personnel Costs 

Wages and Salaries 

Significant actions w 7 ere taken shortly after Michael Brown’s 
appointment as emergency manager. Almost immediately 
after his appointment, the salaries, benefits, and other 
compensation were eliminated for the city’s mayor and 
nine council, members. The mayor’s salary was later 
restored to 60% of his base salary with full restoration of 
his benefits, and. the salaries of city council members were 
restored to $7,000 per year with no benefits. Additionally, 
council members were required to complete level one of the 
Michigan Municipal League’s core courses for municipal 
government. Several positions were eliminated, which 
included the Office of the Ombudsman, the Civil Service 
Commission, and the respective staff assigned, to these 
offices.

In an effort to reduce the city government’s wage expenses 
by 20%™, significant changes were made to the collective 
bargaining agreements of the City of Flints’s police and fire 
unions. Wages were reduced, across the board, for members 
of all police unions: by 1.5% for sergeants, by 2.5% for 
captains and lieutenants, and by 5% for officers). Salaries 
and wages of members of the firefighters’ union were also 
reduced 10 . 

Substantial changes were also made to the city government 
contracts with the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) locals 1600 and 
1799, the unions representing the majority of general city 
government employees. Wages for Local 1600 members 
were reduced by 2.5%, and several changes to overtime, 
holiday, and leave pay were made for both unions. 

With the. exception of emergency overtime, the EM required 
that all employee overtime be approved in. advance. 
Executive orders were also issued to put limitations on 
departments’ spending authority, with EM approval 
required, for purchases over $10,000. Stringent budgetary 
guidelines were put. on all departments, emphasizing that 
budgetary authority is not a mandate to spend and that 
actions to keep expenses low should be taken whenever 
possible. 

Pensions 

Changes were made to police and. fire unions’ pension 
eligibility. Employees’ annual pension, contributions were 
increased to 9,5% of all earnings for those in the fire and 
police unions. For members of the unions hired prior to the 
introduction of the new pension guidelines, the portion 
of pensions earned up to the 20th year of service are 
calculated according to the expired bargaining agreement. 
However, the multiplier was reduced to 2.25 and capped at 
240 hours of leave time included as part of the. final average 
compensation (FAC) for all service time earned after the 
effective dates of the new collective bargaining agreements. 

Similar adjustments w T ere made to the pension benefits 
for locals 1600 and 1799. The defined benefit multiplier 
was reduced to 1.5% prospectively, and the employee 
contribution rate was increased from 8% to 12% for Local 
1600 and to 9.5% for Local 1799. Hybrid retirement plans 
(with both defined contribution and defined benefit 
components) were established for new hires and former 
defined, benefit plan participants. Employees’ contributions 
to the defined contribution components are matched by the 
City of Flint; employer contributions to the defined benefit 
component were capped at 10%. 


® From $63,080.16 to $50,791.52 for CAD supervisors, from. $60,515.52 
to $56,998.24 for quartermaster, and from $33,467.20 to $27,270.88 for 
comm, specialist trainees 


To save administration-related costs, pensions for all unions 
with collective bargaining agreements with the City of Flint 
were transferred from the Flint Employees’ Retirement 
System (FER.S) to the Michigan Municipal Employees 
Retirement System (MERS).“ This move was approved by 
all but the police officers’ union; section 19(k) of PA 4 was 
invoked to approve the transfer of Flint police officers’ 
pensions. 

Other Post-Employment Benefits 

Changes were made to the healthcare benefits received 
by retirees of the police and fire, unions. Cuts included 
discontinuing healthcare, for a former employees’ spouse if 
he or she is eligible to receive paid health coverage through 
an employer or former employer. The City or Flint reduced 
the number of plans offered to employees hired after July 
.1, 2012, offering a high deductible plan in conjunction, with 
a health savings account. Through executive orders, the 
EM reserved the right of the city to change or discontinue 
the health insurance programs in response to the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPA.CA.) as amended. 

The City of Flint scaled back its contribution requirements 
for an active employee’s health coverage, requiring 
employees to pay any premium contributions that exceed 
the amount contributed by the employer through pension 
deductions. 

Retirees and their spouses aged 65 and over who are 
covered by Medicare supplemental plan at. the employer’s 
expense are. subject to contribution limits of the Publicly- 
Funded Health Insurance Contribution. Act. (PA .152 of 2012) 
if and. only if the retiree enrolls in and pays for Medicare 
Supplemental Part R. Changes made to the healthcare 
coverage of retired members of the local 1600 and 1799 
unions were similar to those of the other major unions 
representing City of Flint employees. 

Changes were made to the retiree health benefits offered 
to personnel hired after the effective dates of the new 
agreements. Instead of employer -paid retiree healthcare 
coverage, members of the police officers’ and firefighters’ 
unions, as well as locals 1.600 and 1799 hired after April 20.1.2 
were, eligible for Retiree Medical Savings Accounts (RMS As) 
to which the City of Flint and employees contribute 
through payroll deductions. 

Under the executive orders, the City of Flint committed 
to contribute $1,500 annually to the RMSAs, with 
employees contributing $600 per year. Employees will, be 
100% vested at all times on their own contributions and 
investment earnings, while employer contributions and 
investment earnings will be 100% vested after five years of 
completed service. The same changes were made to retiree 
health benefits of newly hired nonunion city government 


employees. Contributions to a new employee’s RMSA 
continue until the employee is no longer employed by the 
City of Flint (including retirement) or when the employee 
becomes eligible for Medicare. These benefits were not 
made available to nonunion retirees or spouses who are 
eligible for health coverage through another employer or 
former employer. 

Other Reforms 

In addition to actions taken to reduce the City of Flint’s 
financial obligations in relation to staff, other measures 
were taken to address the growing deficit. User fees were 
implemented for waste collection and a special assessment 
was levied, to provide funds for the. operation of street 
lighting (to eliminate $2.85 million in costs to the city 
government’s general fund x ). Both fees were added to 


homeowners’ property tax bills. Water and sewer rates 
were increased by 25% to adequately cover the. costs of 
operating both systems. 

The City of Flint’s Fiscal. Year 2013 budget, passed by an 
executive order on April 24, 2012, was the first balanced 
budget it had passed in seven years. A. total, of 155 positions 
(16% of the workforce) were eliminated.” 

Property taxes were increased in order to support: police 
and fire budgets. This increase was achieved by a vote of 
the. city’s residents, who approved a 6 mill property tax 
increase on. November 6, 2012. xii This tax. increase allowed 
the city government to maintain staffing levels in the police 
and fire departments that, had, up until that point, been 
supported through a federal grant. 



IV. City Finances 

Repeated periods of governmental fund deficits can be used to identify cities 
with chronic fiscal stress. If a city is consistently unable to sustain a positive 
fund balance, it is likely facing structural budgetary constraints. The City of 
Flint’s fund balance/accumulated deficit history highlights its recurring deficits 
(Exhibit i¥-1). Temporary solutions provided some periods of short-term relief 
in 2005 to 2007 due to the measures taken by an emergency financial manager 
under Public Act 72 of 1990. The governor appointed the EFM in May 2002, who 
remained in place until 2004. The progress made during the EFM’s tenure was 
undone three years later due to subsequent labor settlements, costly litigation, 
and declining revenues. The City of Flint closed FY2G08 with a deficit in the 
General Fund of $6.8 million. Since 2010, the Flint city government has been able 
to build up the fund balances in its other governmental funds, but has mixed 
performance in controlling the deficit in its General Fund, which is the main, 
fund for general operating expenses. 

'WW’S B'feS’R 9W8B 8 sxvsS Bwh 

As of June 30, 2014, the City of Flint’s General Fund ended the year with an 
accumulated deficit of $8.9 million. This is the seventh consecutive year that the 
fund balance has been in a deficit position, but significantly reduced from the 
$19.1 million deficit in FY2012. FY2014 is also the third year since FY2006 that the 
city operated, with a surplus in its General Fund; the only other year in which the 
General Fund ended with a surplus is FY2011 (Exhibit 8Y~2).

Revenues 

As of 2014, the four primary sources of revenue, and their proportionate share 
of the General Fund, are property tax (10%), income tax (24%), state shared 
revenue (32%), and charges for services (18%). Exhibit i¥-3 shows the changes 
in the share of General Fund revenues over time. Typically, the property tax 
is the primary source of revenue for local governments. However, the City of 
Flint's reliance on the property tax has severely diminished over the last several 
years, which is a testament to the impact of falling property values in the city. 
Conversely, the share of revenues from charges for services has seen an overall 
growth. In. FY2010, the share or revenues from charges for services actually 
exceeded that: from property taxes. Both the share of revenues of income taxes 
and of state shared revenue have also declined, but to a lesser extent. The 
spike in the share of “Other” revenue funds in FY2011 was due to an $8 million 
debt issuance in the form, of 25-year fiscal stabilization bonds from the Local 
Government Loan Program through the Michigan Department of Treasury. This 
was less than, half of the $20 million in bonds that the City of Flint had initially- 
requested in order maintain operations when it had anticipated, that it would 
run. out of cash by March 1, 20,1.1. 


Property Tax 

Property tax in Michigan is assessed on both real and personal property, though 
municipalities are limited in levying property taxes in. a number of ways. First, 
the Home Rule City Act of 1909 limits cities in Michigan to levying property 
taxes of no more than. 20 mills for direct municipal services.™ Next, the Headlee 
Amendment, ratified in. 1978, limits the authorized millage rate when property 
values rise at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. xiv Increases in property values 
due to improvements or new construction are not subject to this limit. Finally, 
in 1994, Michigan voters approved Proposal A, which limited annual increases to 
the taxable value to 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, until there is 
a transfer of ownership.”

Compared to the 10 most populated local units in Genesee County, which 
represent 72% of the population, the city of Flint levies the highest homestead 
tax rate (Exhibit !¥~4). This may cause the city to be less competitive in 
attracting residents, which hinders its ability to increase its tax base. High 
tax rates also create incentives for residents to relocate to the suburban areas, 
which may be one factor that contributes to the population decentralization 
trends shown in Exhibit II~2. For example, a homeowner in the city of Flint 
will pay, on average, 37.7% more in property taxes than residents of the nine 
other largest communities that own properties with the same taxable value. 

This is a substantial increase compared, to the same analysis that was performed, 
in the 2011 case study; in FY20I1, a homeowner in Flint would pay on average 
28.2% more than a homeowner in the other nine communities with, a property 
that had the same taxable value. If a residential property has a taxable value of 
$75,000, the homeowner in Flint will pay $4,413. A homeowner in the next: most- 
populated community. Grand Blanc Charter Township, will pay $3,119.

Although the nonhomestead property tax rate had been fairly stable from 2000 
to 2010, a more noticeable increase has occurred over the last few years (Exhibit 
i V-S). In 2013, the direct city millage increased from 16.1 to 19.1 mills with the 
addition of the 6 mill public safety millage and an elimination of a 3 mill waste 
collection millage. 

As discussed in section II, property values in Flint have dramatically declined 
over the past four years. Exhibit SY-S shows a corresponding reduction in 
property tax revenues; receipts from property taxes in FY2014 were less than half 
those in FY2006, and less than 40% of their peak in FY2008. The deterioration 
of the property tax as a stable revenue source is especially clear given that less 
than 10% of General Fund revenues are dependent on property taxes in FY2014 
compared to more than 18% five years prior.

Of the 10 largest cities in Michigan, three are authorized to levy an income tax, 
including Flint. The Income tax rate is 1% for city residents and 0.5% for non- 
residents. Income tax receipts steadily declined from FY2006 to FY20.10 (Exhibit 
1 V~7). Since FY2010, this revenue stream has stabilized and seen some slight 
growth, though it fell again in FY2014. 


State shared revenue is generated from, a statewide sales tax. Revenue sharing to 
local governments consists of both constitutional and statutory payments. The 
constitutional portion is distributed on a population basis. The statutory portion 
of revenue sharing is defined by a formula based on a combination of population, 
taxable value per capita, and millage yield (a ratio of the taxable value per mill 
levied). Starting in FY2012, the statutory revenue sharing was replaced with 
the Economic Vitality Incentive Program (EVIP). M The EV1P allocates funding 
to cities, villages, and townships based on their ability to satisfy certain 
criteria, but relies on the old statutory program to determine participation and 
individual payment amounts. Exhibit IV-8 shows the breakdown between the

constitutional payments and statutorv/EVIP payments to the City of Flint since 
FY1998. While constitutional payments have been fairly constant, there has been 
a substantial decline in statutory/EVIP payments. 

Exhibit SV-9 displays the change in state shared revenue over time as reported 
in the city’s financial audit reports. 

Charges for Services 

While all other revenue sources have been declining since FY2006, income from 
user fees and charges for services have actually increased on a nominal basis over 
the same period (Exhibit IV-10). Though it has fluctuated in recent years, the 
percentage of revenues and transfers from, charges for services is still relatively 
high compared to FY2G06. This is indicative of cities undergoing fiscal stress 
since they seek to replace the typical tax and intergovernmental sources with 
other revenue streams.

General Government 

As of FY2014, general government expenditures include the following categories 
of local government operations: 

> Mayor’s office 

> Finance 

> Human, relations 
i City clerk 

> Law office 

> Human resources 

> City administrator 

Expenditures on general government have followed an overall decline since 
FY2008 (Exhibit IY-13). The exception in FY2011 was due to a settlement 
payment related to a lawsuit against the city regarding the sale of the Genesee 
Towers building. 

Revenues and expenditure trends for other governmental funds are shown in 
Exhibit iV-14. These include special revenue funds and debt service funds. As 
of FY2014, special revenue funds consist of the following types of funds:

city government has managed to keep expenditures in pace with revenues. About

The City of Flint’s two proprietary funds include water supply and sewer 
disposal operations. Prior to FY2G12, Hurley Medical Center and the Golf 
Division were considered business-type activities as part of the city government 
under proprietary funds. However, starting in FY2012, the city began presenting 
Hurley as a separate component: unit in the audit report, and in March 2012, the 
city entered into agreements with Flint City Golf, LLC, and the Mott Park Public 
Golf Course Association to operate the city’s golf courses. 

Historically, the City of Flint purchased Lake Huron water from, the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). Per a resolution that authorized the 
sale of Drinking Water Revolving Fund bonds, the city government sets its w'ater 
rates to cover expenses of the administration and operation, of the water system. 
These expenses include the rates charged by the DWSD, which had increased 
on average by 10% per year. The rates must be sufficient to pay an amount equal 
to 125% of principal and interest on bonds and any other obligations. In January 
2011, the city increased water and sewer rates by 2.5% and 22% respectively. 
Another increase of 35% on both water and sewer rates followed in September 
2011. it! order to meet these revenue requirements. 

In April 2013, the. city ended its contract with DWSD, and opted instead to 
contract with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to build a pipeline from. 
Lake Huron to Genesee County. Effective October 1, 2013, the City of Flint 
entered into a contract to purchase water from the KWA., with the pipeline 
expected to be completed, in July 2016. The city officially switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, to be used until the agreement with the 
KWA came into effect. However, the city and its residents have experienced 
several issues with water quality since then. xviii . Flint was awarded $2 million 
from the state through Michigan’s Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program to improve its water infrastructure and quality™.

In general, the revenues and transfers Into the water supply fund have exceeded

In contrast, the sewer disposal, fund had seen major deficits annually up 
until FY2013 (Exhibit IV-16). One major contributor to the operating losses 
associated with this fund is internal borrowing by other funds. This will, be

The City of Flint allocates the internal service funds for data processing, fringe 
benefits, central maintenance garage, and self-insurance. Internal service funds 
should be self-sustaining through charges for services to other departments and 
funds. However, this is not always the case, as shown by the positive figures for 
“Transfers In” in Exhibit IY-17. The Central Maintenance Garage Fund received 
incoming transfers for six consecutive years. On average, these transfers amount 
to about 28% of operating costs annually. There was an exception in FY2013, in 
which the Central Maintenance Garage Fund issued an outgoing transfer to the 
Garbage Collection Fund in order to transfer proceeds related to the sale of city 
garbage trucks.

Debt 


The City of Flint’s bond rating has not been updated since the 2011 case study 
was written. The last bond rating was performed by Moody’s Investor Service in 
February 2006. At that time, the City of Flint was assigned a rating of Bal with a 
stable outlook. 

According to the city’s financial audit reports, the City Charter limits net debt 
to 7% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the city. Exhibit 
V-1 discloses breakdown of the city’s net debt limit since 2004. While the 
absolute amount of the city’s debt has been fairly stable over time, the decline 
in property values in the city has closed the legal debt margin considerably 
(Exhibit V~1). As a result, the net debt as a percentage of the debt: limit has 
jumped from about 4.3% in FY2007 to 16.6% in FY20I3. 

Many cities with chronic fiscal stress have a significantly large debt burden, 
which has not necessarily been the case for the City of Flint. The 2011 case study 
noted that this issue of fiscal distress was mainly due to the lack of capacity to 
issue debt or manage a long-term capital improvement program. In FY20U, the 
City made its final payment on an. $8 million financial recovery bond issued in 
2004 when it was operating under the authority of a state-appointed EFM. As 
noted earlier, the current level of fiscal stress has caused the City of Flint to 
seek $20 million fiscal stabilization bonds, of which it received $8 million. These 
funds are intended to address the chronic cash shortage and unfunded prior 
operating expenditures. Recurring cash shortages and the need to finance prior 
years’ operations are often considered additional red flags indicating chronic 
fiscal stress. 

Another symptom of chronic fiscal stress is an increased reliance on internal 
borrowing, another trend that has continued since the 2011 case study. When 
the City of Flint has difficulty obtaining external financing at a reasonable rate, 
cash from, internal funds becomes a default source of borrowing. Exhibit V-2 
summarizes interfund borrowing activity since FY2006. The nature of this type, 
of activity? is generally related to operating transactions among funds. The City 
of Flint has used this to address cash shortages at the close of the fiscal year. 

The “Due to/from Other Funds” section, is related to short-term loans, while the

“Advances to/from Other Funds” is related to long-term loans. A concern, arises 
when these balances are significant in dollar amounts and present for more than 
one year. The City of Flint’s General Fund has relied on short-term interfund 
resources for seven out of the last nine fiscal years and long-term interfund 
resources since FY2GI2. As shown in Exhibit ¥-2, the primary lending fund for 
these transfers has been the Sewer Disposal Division Fund, which contributes to 
the fund’s long-term structural deficit, as reported in Exhibit i¥~1 B on page 26. 
The short-term balance of approximately $13.2 million at June 30, 2013, equates 
to almost 25% of General Fund revenues for FY2014. 

Tn July 2012, the Flint City Council President, along with three other residents, 
filed a lawsuit against: the city, claiming that the water and sewer rate increases 
in 20.1.1 violated city ordinances.** The claim was that because water and sewer 
funds have been transferred to the General Fund, additional funds raised had 
not been allocated toward their intended purposes. A Genesee County Circuit 
Court j udge dismissed the case in June 2013, claiming that: the rate increases 
were in compliance with. Public Act 4, which granted legal power to emergency 
managers to make rate, increases to reflect true operating costs. 

As noted in the 2011 case study, advances among funds are often formalized in 
a written note with, specific payment terms including an interest rate. The City 
of Flint has used advances to fund capital equipment purchases in its internal 
services funds. Such reliance on interfund borrowings may restrict the lending 
fund’s financial flexibility and use of resources for the designated purpose. 
Recent advances from the Sewer Disposal Division Fund to the General Fund 
represent return on equity.

VI. Personnel Costs 


Exhibit VI-1 Flint Full-Time 
Equivalent Employees 

Data source: City of Flint Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report 


Annual 



The City of Flint’s payroll has declined by almost 1,000 full-time equivalent 
employees, about 63%, since 2001 due to attrition and downsizing (Exhibit 
VI-1). This breaks down to a 59% reduction in public safety employees and a 
65% reduction in other city employees. The majority of this reduction has taken 
place since 2008. 


The City of Flint has a defined benefit pension plan with a benefit: that ranges 
from 1.7% to 2.6% of the participant’s Final Average Compensation (FAC) based 
on the last three years of credited service, multiplied by the years of credit 
service based on the date of hire. Employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 
years of credited service (eight: years for appointed officials) or those members 
with 25 years of credited service (23 years for police and fire employees), 
regardless of their age, are entitled to a retirement benefit. Certain police 
members can voluntarily retire at age 50 with 25 years of service. Benefits fully 
vest on reaching 10 years of service with the benefit: payable at age 55. The plan 
requires employee contributions ranging from 0% to 9%. 

Beginning in October 2012, the City of Flint closed out its single-employer plan 
and transferred approximately $270 million of assets to the Michigan Municipal 
Employees’ Retirement System, an. agent multi-employer plan that covers 
substantially all employees of city government:. The City of Flint’s unfunded 
pension liability is $241 million, as of its most recent actuarial valuation. 


Defined benefit plan pension benefits are determined by following a three-part:

Years of Service - Years of service is based on actual employee service, 
although sometimes the employee or employer may “buy” years of service at an 
actuarially determined cost. Unless this is fully funded in advance, it increases 
the long-term liability. 

Final Average Compensation (FAC) - The final average compensation is 
the average of wages or salary paid to the employee based, on a predetermined 
number of years. Identifying what type of compensation is included in the FAC 
is important. If it includes overtime, vacation leave payout, longevity, and other 
pay items, the cost to the employer increases. When the FAC is determined 
using fewer years, typically the benefit is higher since it is based, on highest 
years. When the FAC period is very short, even small increases in overtime, 
compensatory time payout, or accrued leave time payout will increase the 
pension. This is the reason some retirees’ actual pension benefits are higher than 
their regular full-time pay as active employees. 

Pension Multiplier ~ The pension multiplier represents a percent of pay for 
each year or service. 

A cost of living adjustment (COLA) provides an annual increase in benefit 
retirement. A COLA benefit of E2 provides a 2% annual increase in pension 
for retirees. Granting automatic pension increases can further constrain future 
administrations. Employers typically have a pension plan design where they may 
instead grant a one-time COLA adjustment to retirees. 

The proportion of the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) that the city 
government has contributed to cover pension expenses has improved over the 
past several years (Exhibit VI -2), For every year since. FY2009, the City of Flint 
has contributed at least the ARC amount. 

Flint’s pension Unfunded Accrued Actuarial Liability (UAAL) has increased 
from $194 million in 2006 to $323 million in 2011, which was the time of the last 
actuarial valuation (Exhibit Vi-3). The funded ratio fell during this time from 
81% to 61%.

The City of Flint contributes to other post-employment benefits (OPFB) for 
public safety and genera] employees under collective bargaining agreements of 
Local 1799, Local 1600, and Fire Local 352. The proportion of the ARC that the 
city has paid to cover OPEB expenses has improved over the past couple years, 
from 31% in FY2011 to only 114% in FY2014 (Exhibit VS»4). 

Since its actuarial valuation in 2006, the City of Flint’s unfunded OPEB liability 
has been cut by $468 million. The city government began advance funding its 
OPEB plan in FY2012, which has been reflected in its 2012 actuarial valuation. As 
of this valuation, the plan is 0.1% funded, though that dropped to 0% in the 2013

VII. Conclusion 


On April 30, 2015, Gov. Rick Snyder rescinded the financial 
emergency in Flint and restored home rule and the power 
of the city’s elected officials. It had been more than 10 years 
since the last: time such an event occurred in Flint in the 
summer of 2004. Many questions still continue to swirl 
around the city’s fiscal and economic future. A review of the 
reforms and changes that occurred since the appointment of 
an emergency manager in. 2011 is a useful starting point for 
the city to understand the future fiscal trajectory it faces. 
This review will allow local and state officials to assess the 
reforms and changes in place and shape the future fiscal 
policy of the city of Flint, Michigan. 

Changes implemented by the four emergency managers 
appointed to oversee Flint’s finances were aimed at 
reducing the. city’s considerable budgetary deficit through 
reducing its financial obligations, especially pensions 
and other retiree benefits, while increasing city revenue. 
Some of the most significant changes have impacted the 
employees and retirees of the City of Flint. These two 
groups were the most important creditors of the city 
government. They remain so. Like, many city governments 
in Michigan, Flint, does not. carry a large debt burden 
outside of water and sewer borrowing. This means that city 
retirees and employees are the groups owed the most, by 
the city government and therefore, will be the most: directly 
impacted during a financial reorganization following a fiscal 
crisis. 

The structure of the city government was changed, with 
staffing reduced by 20%. A city administrator, who will 
serve as the city’s chief administrative officer, was hired 
on a five-year contract. Among other responsibilities, the 
city administrator has the authority to negotiate collective 
bargaining agreements with the city’s employee unions. 

Reforms were also made to the way the city’s budgeting 
practices, requiring two-year budgeting and three-year 
financial forecasts to be performed annually. This will allow 
city officials to identify and potentially deal with budgetary 
issues before they occur. The city government also adopted 
a master plan for the first time since the 1960s. The master 
plan identifies a vision for the city. It was developed with 
considerable input from the residents of Flint. 

The electorate of Flint passed a referendum, to have a 
Charter Review Commission put in place in the summer of 
2015. The nine-member commission was elected in May of 
2015. It: will review the entire charter and assess options for 
reform. This is an excellent opportunity for the commission 
and the citizens of Flint to evaluate the current charter 
and determine a path forward for the city government that 
includes short-and long-term solvency. 


The emergency manager signed a number of final orders 
before leaving office in April 2015. These orders involved, 
the city council including agenda and meeting dates. They 
also included setting the special assessment for street 
lighting, restoring mayor and city council compensation, 
and. adopting a set budget for FY 2016 and 2017. In addition, 
they included an order ensuring compliance with the so- 
called hard cap section of PA 152 of 2011 stating that the city 
shall not pay more than 80% of employee healthcare plans. 

The final and perhaps most important order of the Flint 
emergency manager was issued on April 30, 2015. The 
overall purpose of the order is to ensure that the mayor 
and city council shall implement reforms and changes to 
maintain the fiscal stability of the city government. These 
provisions included following the recommendations of 
the Receivership Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) and 
city administrator. Specific, other actions include 1) fully 
funding the annual pension requirement, 2) not interfering 
with city employees, 3) observing the. budget ordinance, 4) 
ensuring all local laws are consistent with state laws, 5) not 
issuing debt without approval of the RTAB, 6) documenting 
all city liabilities, 7) verifying the appropriate eligibility 
requirements of all official city positions, 8) acting 
expeditiously on all economic development projects, and 9) 
reviewing and acting expeditiously on all intergovernmental 
cooperation initiatives by the city administrator. All of 
these provisions are intended to ensure that the. city 
government, as dictated by the mayor and city council, 
follow certain practices and recommendations that are. 
intended to maintain fiscal stability and solvency. These 
types of provisions were not in place after the 2002-04 
crisis. 

The city administrator is also subject to a number of 
provisions in the final EM order. These provisions include 
1) overseeing day-to-day operation of city government, 2) 
negotiating and recommending changes to bargaining unit 
contracts to the RTAB, 3) submitting regular reports on 
city progress, 4) ensuring full compliance with PA 436 of 
2012, 5) not removing city administrator without approval 
of RTAB, 6) observing all purchasing order ordinances, and. 
7) serving as primary interface between city council and 
city employees. Again, all of these provisions are meant: to 
ensure the fiscal, stability or the city government. 

The changes made by the emergency managers have 
improved Flint’s financial position. The general fund deficit 
was reduced from its peak of over $.19 million in FY2012 
to just over $8 million in the most recent fiscal year. The 
city has applied for a $7 million loan from Michigan’s 
Emergency Loan Board, which would effectively eliminate 


33 




this deficit. Pension and OPEB liabilities have been 
significantly reduced, and reforms to employee collective 
bargaining agreements have reduced future legacy costs. 
Other cost-saving measures include transferring emergency 
dispatch to Genesee County and contracting out waste 
collection. 

Despite the progress made since a fiscal emergency was 
declared, in 20.1.1, the City of Flint still faces considerable 
challenges to its fiscal solvency. Outgoing emergency 
manager jerry Ambrose mentioned some of these in his 
final letter, including the lawsuit filed on behalf of Flint’s 
retirees over changes made to their healthcare benefits, 
the structural deficit that still exists in the city’s financial 
projections, challenges to fund the city’s public safety 
needs, and the city’s ageing infrastructure. 

The overall Flint fiscal playbook that has been enacted by 
the state government and. its emergency managers serves 
as an important: template for these types of interventions.^ 


11 This statement is not meant as recommendation or approval for the 
state emergency manager law. There are many dimensions upon which 
the state emergency manager should be assessed. This statement is 
simply meant to reflect that, in following this path, the Flint experience, 
with one of the state’s largest cities, may be an important reference 
point. 


The first part of the playbook is that any reforms or 
changes must be in reference to the largest component of 
the fiscal problem, which in this case related to liabilities 
owed to employees and retirees. Many important changes 
were made to wages and compensation, pension system 
benefits, medical benefits and other such liabilities. Of 
equal or perhaps greater importance, there are a number 
of safeguards now in place to ensure that these changes 
remain in place for a long period. Any adjustments to these 
reforms must go through the city administrator and the 
RTAB. These safeguards are obviously meant to prevent 
any backsliding to previous wage or benefit: levels, it is this 
type of activity that led to the most recent crisis, as changes 
made by the emergency financial manager in 2004 were not 
kept in. place and most of those changes were rescinded 
by the elected officials between 2004 and. 2011. Those 
changes, combined with the worst recession since the Great 
Depression, meant that the city faced, short- and long-term 
fiscal insolvency in 2011.

DIRECTOR 


September 16, 2015 


VIA E-MAIL 


The Honorable Daniel Kildee 
United States House of Representatives 
Washington, DC 20515 

Dear Congressman Kildee: 

Thank you for your September 9, 201 5, letter regarding your concerns for the drinking water 
in the city of Flint (Flint). The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) is 
working closely with Flint’s water department as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (USEPA) to ensure Flint residents have ample water that meets state and federal 
drinking water standards. 

The MDEQ’s role is to administer its nearly 40-year-old state drinking water protection 
program based on federal guidelines. The MDEQ works with approximately 1 1 ,500 public 
water systems in the state to monitor for more than 90 primary drinking water contaminants 
and ensure that every supply consistently provides safe drinking water. 

In Flint, the city made a decision 18 months ago to switch drinking water sources. This 
change required them to take specific measures under the federal Lead and Copper Rule, 
which was enacted in 1991 to monitor water as it interacts with lead service connections 
and home plumbing. Flint’s test results were conducted according to the same testing 
protocols every Michigan community uses and the same protocols Flint has used to test its 
water every three years for the past 25 years. 

While the results from Flint’s testing show compliance with the federal action level for lead 
and copper, on August 17, 2015, the MDEQ instructed the city to move forward 
expeditiously with developing additional corrosion control treatment to minimize the 
corrosive effects between drinking water and lead service connections and home plumbing 
in the Flint service area. 

We appreciate and share your concern for the situation, and the MDEQ looks forward to 
providing you a detailed briefing next week. If you have any additional questions in the 
meantime, please contact Ms. Maggie Pallone, Deputy Director, Policy and Legislative 
Affairs, at 517-284-6704 or pallonem@michigan.gov; or you may contact me. 

Sincerely,

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still needed 
By Dominic Adams | dadams5@rnlive.com 

on March 25, 2013 at 10:45 PM, updated March 26, 2013 at 1 :28 AM 

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the 

Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25, may have set in 
motion the end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, 
pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million 
gallons per day would come from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s 
getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the 
resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the 
decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start 
drawing water out of the Flint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing water from our 
reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a 
county water and waste advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final 
approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency 
financial manager. All expenditures over $50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 
million annually for water service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it 
pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years by getting water from 
the KWA. 

“It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the 
capacity level approved by city council because there will be increased treatment cost for the 
river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to 
be additional work done at Flint’s water plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, 
however, the plant only operates four times per year. 


l 



Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote. 

“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint 
River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties 
and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw 
water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials said they intend to purchase water, but an 
agreement has been finalized.

ABC 12 Investigates: What's in your water? 

Posted; Jdii 29. 2015 3;38 PM BST 
Updated: Jan 29, 201& limmEST 

By Larry Elliott . j" " CONNECT ) 

FUN I (WJRT) (01T29/iS : J- the resuitsareln aftd We now have a completely ihdep.hdenffedK at what's in 
Flint’s water su pply. 

For t&e Ftint Biyeras it’s wafer source, Flint wafer 

customers have complained of smelly, cloudy; bad tasting water and blame lifora variety of health 
problems. 

Complaints exploded earlier this month when Flint ncstlf ed its wafer customer:, fiat a group of chemicals 
known as TTHM were at much higher average- levels than allowed by jaw. 

With so many questions and distrust of the answers, ABC12‘s Larry Elliott investigates - What's in vour 
Water? 

It seems no matter who you ask in the Riot area, there's an opinion about the city’s water. Most o? She issues.; 
center on the quality of the water and whether it's safe to drink. 

"Right now it smeiis,'' said Flint resident Lee Miller. “We’re getting tyator oat of our own bank yard now arid ifs 
costing me doable what it was coming from Detroit." 

"i! has a funny taste to it." said Flint resident Milton Alexander. 

"It couid be dangerous to os. actually ! don't know how dangerous ii is," said Flint resident Sbarika Sanders. 

'I’m no cheerleader for the water department here, ithi nk we've got a tot of issues to wo rk on." Ken 
VanWagoner, of Good Beans Cafe - Flint. 

Most of the issues center on the quality of the wars' arid whether ifs safe to drink, but concern over its safety 
reached a new high earlier this month when the city was required by the slate Department of Environmental 
Quality to notify residents that the water had exceeded the allowable limit of a group of chemicais known as 
TTHM 

TTHM is in most municipal water systems and is thought by some to be a possible card nog so in. tong term 
: exposure; 

It's a byproduct of cbtonriatianywhich 1 is asmmonly used to help purify water. Last August, as Flint's water 
treatment plant worked to purify the water it was drawing from ins Flint River, levels of TTHM grew to wet! 
ove r the ERA allowed maximum . 

August test results provided by the DEQ to ABC 12 show all of the eight testing sites around Flint had TTHM 
levels well above the legal limit. 

The lowest level among the eight sites was 40 percent above the iegaf limit. The highest was MS percent 






[MU/ZU’ID 


abuiz investigates: vvnars in your water' - Atsu, iz-vvji-c i -runt, ivn 


more than allowed. 

DEQ rules only require the city to report higher than allowed levels to the public once a year, and only if the 
average of quarterly tests is higher than the legal limit 

That notification wentout to residents on Jan. 5. Since then, many residents have refused to believe 
assurances from the DEQ and the city that the water is now safe to drink. 

So, we set out to do complete and independent testing to find out for ourselves exactly what's in yourwater. 

It took a bit of research, but we finally found Water Tech, in Howell, a testing lab with absolutely no ties to 
Flint, just to make sure there are no questions about the test results. 

After having Water Tech train ABC12's Larry Elliott on the proper methods for collecting water samples, we 
set out last week to randomly test five sites in Flint. 

1. Downtown. 

"I'm excited to see this done because this is an independent way to find out that everything's just fine,"

2. The north side. 

"We'd like to do kind ofa whole battery oftests of your water. Oh yeah," Alexander said. 

3. The west side. 

"It could be dangerous to us. How about if we help you find out what's in it right now?" Sanders said. 

4. The east side. 

"I'm hoping for a good test and put my family at ease," Miller said. 

5. Our main studio, on the south side. 

We also wanted to compare whatever we're to find with Detroit supplied water, so we took a sample from the 
Burton water system. 

Since next year Flint will connect to the new KWApipeline, getting its waterfrom Lake Huron, we tooka 
comparison sample from the Saginaw-Midland water system, which currently uses Lake Huron water. 

We tested all the sites for levels of TTHM. We also tested how much residual chlorine was in the Flint and 
Burton water supply and more importantly, we tested at two of our Flint sites for a number of other hazardous 
chemicals that could cause skin or other health problems. 

Tests for those other chemicals are not required for public water systems, but we decided to run those tests 
anyway. 

Here's what our independent testing shows: 

All sites tested, including the Saginaw-Midland water system and the Burton system, using Detroit water, 
contained TTHM - butall of them were well below the EPA allowed maximum. 

Saginaw-Midland water had less than a third of the maximum TTHM allowed, the Burton system had only 
about 25 percent ofthe maximum and the highest level found of all of our Flint tests showed just over 65 
percent of whafs allowed, all below EPA limits. 

A similar byproduct of chlorination, haloacetic acids, was also well below EPA maximums in Flint's water. 

We tested Flint’s north and east water samples for many other hazardous chemicals that a doctor told us 
could cause skin or other health problems, and on both tests, not a single one of those chemicals was 
detected. 

Since most often any smell to the water would be caused by levels of total residua! chlorine, we tested that 
too, in both our Fiintand Burton samples. 

The legal limit is 4 milligrams per liter. The average of our Flint samples shows a level of about a half 
milligram per liter. Our test in Burton actually shows 22 percent more residual chlorine than Flint. 

Our Flint sample also showed no Coliform bacteria. 

We asked Chris McCarthy, of Water Tech, a few questions.

Q: How would you describe these test results? 

A: "Well, for the samples received, the tests we performed, everything is within EPA guidelines for safe 
drinking water." 

Q: Is there anything in these results that raises a red flag for you? 

A: "For water quality or water safety, No.” 

We then asked residents if these results change their opinion of what they'll do with their water now. 

"To be honest, no," Alexander said. 

"It will make me feel a lot more comfortable about bathing and brushing my teeth in it, but I'm still not going to 
drink it and I'm not gonna give it to my kids or my dog," Sanders said. 

"It makes me feel a lot more safer, a lot more comfortable knowing that it's safe to drink now, you know. I'll tell 
you a load lifted off my shoulders. When the kids take baths, when my wife takes a shower, you know, I know 
now we're safe," Miller said. 

So what about those whoVe stood before Flint City Council with jugs of discolored water? 

While Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright points out he has no jurisdiction over Flint's water 
system, he says in general, discolored water like this is nearly always the result of water main breaks or 
repairs, and Flint has more than its share because of its aging system. 

Wright also says the KWA pipeline won't change that. It will take better management of repairs and money - 
lots of it- to replace Flint's aging water mains. 

Unfortunately for the city of Flint, those very high levels of TTHM recorded last August in Flint water tests are 
still required by the DEQto be included in the next report calculating average TTHM levels. 

The next test will be done next week, and city Public Works Director Howard Croft tells ABC12, because of 
the high levels last August, the city will again be found in violation and will be required by the DEQto send 
out another TTHM notice of violation to all Flint water customers in early March, even if all new tests show 
levels under the legal limit.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state 
approval still needed 

By Dominic Adams | dadatns5@rolive.com 

on March 25, 2013 at 10:45 PM, updated March 26, 2013 at 1 :28 AM 
FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part 
of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25, may 
have set in motion the end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from 
Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout 
the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and 
will be treated in Flint. 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must 
approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings 
surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 
There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the 
economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River Watershed 
Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Flint River, we 
are at risk of having to start releasing water from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be 
approved by a county water and waste advisory board. The KWA board will then 
be reconvened for final approval. 


l 



Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint 
has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over $50,000 must be 
approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay 
roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined the pipeline - a nearly 
$4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years by 
getting water from the KWA. 

“It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less 
with the capacity level approved by city council because there will be increased 
treatment cost for the river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 1 8 million gallons per day or there 
would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and 
Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times per year. 
Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote. 

“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel 
like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and 
Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to 
purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials said they intend to 
purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

Hello Dennis, 

As we discussed, below are tangible steps I think we can take to help Flint residents through this water 

problem. 

• Make DHHS the lead agency. 

• Provide DHHS staff support to expand Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha'sresearch efforts. Specifically, more 
monitoring of blood-level data. 

• Help put together private, state, and endowment funds that will support and maintain a filter program. 
House a emergency readiness expert in DHHS to create the logistical framework for implementation of 
the filter program 

• When the County Health Department issues a health advisory work with DHHS to allow WIC recipients 
to use their resources on water and ready made formula. 

Thanks for lunch and the chat,

I can't say thank yon enough to everyone who supported me and the entire Flint community. It has been the honor of a lifetime to be 
mayor of our great City of Flint. 

By working together we changed Flint for the better. From die bottom of the recession and through four state-appointed emergency 
managers, Flint's heart beat continued and positive developments were made in every part of the city. 

Good work is being done every day to fix the water, win the war on blight, reduce crime, support new businesses, engage our youth, and 
provide essential public and community services. I am most proud of how we worked together to develop a comprehensive vision for 
Flint's future as a 21st Century' City in the Imagine Flint Master Plan. The plan will serve as a blueprint for the next chapter in Flint's 
prosperity. 

I am also confident that the positive momentum will be carried forward in the months and years to come. Here at City Hall, there is a 
strong professional management team in place along widi a strategic plan, two-year budget, five-year financial projection and a 
performance evaluation process. This is very different from what I inherited six years ago when I first came into office as your mayor. 

Despite die difficulties we continue to face, I know diere is a bright fiiture ahead and my family and I look forward to being 
involved. Thanks again for your support. You may reach me at dayngwaUing@ gmail . com .

MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Sheldon A* Neeley 

STATE REPRESENTATIVE 


January 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 


Dear Gov. Snyder, 

With the dawn of a new beginning in our state, the city of Flint stands on the precipice of civil 
unrest. This letter comes as an appeal to your office concerning this proud Michigan community 
and recent discussions pertaining to Flint’s water distribution and management strategies for both 
present and future operations. Flint has had a long history concerning the implementation of 
water practices and financial management of its water assets. Our present journey has caused us 
to take a closer look at our 80-year-old infrastructure and examine a difficult position where we 
must correct some past and even present challenges, one of which is affecting the people of my 
community to the point of a fervor over something as simple as drinking clean water. 

As we engage these challenges, Flint must revisit the present water revolving loan plans to 
determine how these current funding obligations will affect water delivery and asset 
development for the future. It is clear that no significant improvements can be obtained without 
some supportive concessions. Therefore, I am requesting on behalf of the 34th District, which 
contains a portion of the city of Flint, for you to consider an executive decision to forgive (in- 
total or part) Flint’s water fund loan balances of $20,770,336 so that we may effectively apply 
those funds to rebuilding the city’s infrastructure, to competitively obtain highly qualified 
personnel and provide a more cost effective water delivery system. I understand there has been 
many requests made of your office to resolve this very serious issue, but this approach will best 
safeguard the health and welfare of the residents of Flint as well as minimize the potential for 
litigation against the city of Flint and/or the state of Michigan. 

With a cost-effective water delivery system, we will be able to improve our system in the 
following ways: upgrade wastewater treatment processes, improve safe drinking water upgrades, 
and maintain and sustain a water system that provides a better quality of water product to the 
citizens of Flint.

It is imperative that this issue be addressed in some way on the state level. Residents of Flint are 
already finding themselves forced to take drastic measures simply to have clean drinking water. 

Community health could be on the decline as citizens become afraid to even shower or bathe in 
their homes. The people of Flint bring bottles of brown water full of sediment and other foreign 
substances to community meetings, asking only to be treated as human beings. That is all I am 
asking of you - to see the suffering and anger from the people in one of Michigan’s 
municipalities and understand that there is a need to react and respond to this crisis. 

With the beginning of a new year to work toward a better Michigan, my office is ready to have 
discussions on this request and other planning that works to improve OUR Michigan. I sincerely 
thank you in advance for your consideration on this matter. 

For the Love of the Community,

Flint Task Force Letter 

FWATF-Snyder Letter %28122915%29.pdf; ATT00001.txt 


Here's a copy of the letter the Gov received yesterday from the Flint Water Advisory Task Force. It's good background for 
you and Arlan. 


l 



December 29, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 



This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 
this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 

A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 


2 



legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 


We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 
time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 

We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDFIFIS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community. 

Respectfully yours.

Good Morning Gentlemen, 

Jim has placed a call to Senator Levin asking him if he would be interested in serving in some 
capacity on the Flint water review but they have not connected. To be fair to the Governor he 
wanted to make him aware that he would like Senator Levin to have a role in the process. 

Thanks, 

Andy

Subject: Executive consideration 


I am sending this email to renew my request for assistance from the Governor's Office. 

As we engage these challenges, Flint must revisit the present water revolving loan plans to determine how 
these current funding obligations will affect water delivery and asset development for the future. It is clear 
that no significant improvements can be obtained without some supportive concessions. Therefore, I am 
requesting on behalf of the 34 th district (Flint) for you to consider an Executive decision to forgive (in-total or 
part) Flint's water fund loan balances of $20,770,336.00 so that we may effectively apply those funds to 
rebuilding the City's infrastructure, to competitively obtaining highly qualified personnel and provide a more 
cost effective water delivery system. Hence, I know there has been many request made of your office to 
resolve this very serious issue but this approach will best safeguard the health and welfare of the residents of 
Flint as well as minimize the potential for litigation against the City of Flint and/or the State of Michigan. 

Please see a previous request letter for assistance attached to this communication. 

Thank you
