All, 

Mr. Earley asked me to share with you his response to the below media inquiry. It was as follows: 

"The decision to separate from DWSD and go with the Karegnondi Water Authority, including the decision to 
pump Flint river water in the interim, were both a part of a long-term plan that was approved by Flint's Mayor, 
and confirmed by a City Council vote of 7-1 in March of 2013 - a full seven months before I began my term as 
Emergency Manager. That vote was supported and signed into emergency order by then Emergency Manager 
Edward Kurtz on March 29, 2013. It was my responsibility to implement the previously accepted and approved 
plan as the contract with DWSD expired in April 2014 during my term as EM. It did not fall to me to second 
guess or to invalidate the actions that were taken prior to my appointment. An even bigger concern that 
everyone should be focused on moving forward is what is done in the long-term to replace the crumbling 
water distribution system that exits throughout Flint and Genesee County." 

Please let him know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your recent correspondence to Governor Rick Snyder's office. As a member of 
Governor Snyder's staff, please accept this response on his behalf. 

Michigan’s deteriorating infrastructure is in need of revitalization if we are to continue successfully 
reinventing our economy. Michigan is not only the automotive leader of the nation but also a leader in 
developing innovative road construction materials which can be used to improve Michigan’s 
roadways. We can only continue being a transportation leader if we upgrade our own infrastructure. 

Governor Snyder believes reinvention means reinvestment from us, the residents of Michigan, in the 
infrastructure that allows us to work, play and live in our beautiful state. We cannot reinvent our state 
without first shoring up its foundation. Whether traveling by foot, bicycle, car, truck, plane, train or 
bus, all residents and visitors to our great state deserve safe and unencumbered sidewalks, roads 
and rails. 

Gov. Rick Snyder issued the following statement on November 3, 2015 after the state Flouse and 
Senate approved a comprehensive, long-term plan to address Michigan’s infrastructure challenges. 

“The state House and Senate approved a fiscally responsible, comprehensive transportation plan that 
provides a long-term solution with new revenue that also provides long-term tax relief. This is the 
largest investment in Michigan roads and bridges in more than half a century, making them safer for 
Michiganders long into the future. 

“I commend my partners in the Legislature for their resolve and their willingness to compromise. 
These are difficult decisions. If left unaddressed, our infrastructure problems would have grown more 
expensive to fix, there would have been greater damage to our vehicles and, more importantly, more 
drivers left to face unsafe conditions. 


i 


“The plan approved today includes new revenue generated by people and businesses using the 
roads -- including non-residents. It helps with public transportation that is vital for many to get to work 
and school. And it’s good for our economy, strengthening the network of local, state and federal roads 
that is vital for all of our job-creators. It also allows us to continue investing in our core priorities that 
help Michiganders and fuel our state’s comeback. 

“This plan also shows people around the country and around the world that Michiganders face our 
toughest problems and solve them. Preserving our roads and bridges has been a priority, and is 
another important step we’ve taken to make our state a better place to live and work.” 

Once the bills are enrolled and sent to Governor Snyder’s desk for consideration, he has 14 days to 
make a decision on the legislation. Please know that when the legislation makes it to his desk he will 
keep your comments close at hand. 

As we continue to work towards more meaningful reforms that will transform Michigan's government 
processes, we appreciate your comments and feedback. Thank you for contacting our office, and 
please do not hesitate to call on us if there is anything we can do for you. 

Sincerely,

Subject: Mattawan Water Issue (see enclosure) 

Dear Governor, 

In the next few emails I'll be sending you information concerning an ordeal that transpired in Mattawan Michigan 
somewhat similar to Flint but on a much smaller scale. Although the incident does not involve lead poisoning it does 
denote some of the same issues Flint residents experienced with the MDEQ when reporting problems with their water. 

The geography involved consists of a nationally recognized wetland situated in what is considered by the MDEQ as a 
high recharge area for a water aquifer serving multiple families. The wetland was used as an unsupervised open dump 
site by multiple entities for over 20 years. Along with yards of debris, there were barrels of fuel oil discovered by the site 
along with deionized water indicating the possibility of dumpling by industry sometime during the dumps lifetime. 

It took almost three years of effort to get the MDEQ to do their jobs. Along the way they ignored complaints of fuel 
spills, covert hazardous waste removal, and refused to conduct proper soil sampling to ensure the water supply is 
indeed safe. They used the excuse of not having the funds or personnel resources to fulfil the requirements of their own 
policy. 

I have security cameras that captured some of the aforementioned episodes contradicting what the MDEQ employees 
reported to the EPA to avoid scrutiny by the federal agency. As it stands now we have a water aquifer with a ten year 
water movement (length of time it takes water in the aquifer to move from one side of the aquifer to the other) and 
heaps of soil removed from the wetland but still in piles adjacent to the original dump site and still on top of the aquifer 
where leaching occurs. 

The bottom-line is it was evident from the beginning that the MDEQ didn't want to deal with the issue and did 
everything they could to not find evidence that would require further action on their part. In the end, I 
unenthusiastically accepted five years of water testing by the agency because it was apparent that they would not 
properly remedy the situation. That said, as it stands now others downstream who use the same aquifer are unaware of 
how the situation was handled and the potential for chemicals to reach their wells within the ten year water 
movement. Again this is a high recharge area for the aquifer - meaning rain and snow melt saturate the area thereby 
significantly increasing the infiltration of water into the soil and subsequent leaching of embedded chemicals into the 
aquifer. 

There are three primary MDEQ employees that were complicit in an attempt to conceal what transpired: Bryce Feighner, 
Fred Sellers, and Lee Anne Thor. As stated I have video, email, and other documents that support my accusations. 


l 



I look forward to talking about possible remedies and await your response. 


Respectfully, 



Mattawan

RE: Flint Water 

Dear Mr. 



Thank you for your recent correspondence sent to Governor Rick Snyder regarding the water in 
Flint. As a member of Governor Snyder’s staff, I am responding on his behalf. 

Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water 
Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is 
completed. Governor Snyder has asked the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 
million needed to reconnect with the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be 
completed. The Flint city government will provide $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation 
has committed $4 million. 

Governor Snyder said “Flint residents need to have access to safe, clean, water now and long into 
the future.” The technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to 
the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for children and families. 
The Governor appreciates Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s 
generous commitment, and the dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and 
children. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection and to assist with health and 
infrastructure issues. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1 .3 
million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

The move to Detroit water, which is expected to include many public health benefits. As large 
bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and 
other runoff issues that can sometimes be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes 
Water Authority water already has additional corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the 
insides of pipes and limit lead from leaching into the water. However, reconnecting with the authority 
will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take 
time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some 
households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing 
are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Governor Snyder, state, and local authorities will continue to carry 
out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Health and Human 
Services (MDHHS) also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure 
monitoring for lead in drinking water. 


i 




Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDFIFIS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department 
offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. 
to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about 
proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, 
including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and 
running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking 
and especially mixing baby formula. 

The state also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 
37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal 
action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised 
to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Please visit Michigan.gov/Flintwaterfor additional resources. 

Thank you, again, for taking the time to share your concerns with our office. Should you have any 
further comments, questions or concerns regarding this or any other state-related matter, I’ve 
included my contact information below.

I remember when John Engler created the Department of Environmental Quality, and it was a way for 
Businesses to skirt Environmental Laws. John Engler created the DEQ so that business could find a 


2 



way to skirt the EPA rules and open the abandon mines in the UP, and business could shove the 
Deep Injection Well by the Airport down the people's throats like it or not. Governor Granholm then 
dissolved the DEQ and put the Department of Natural Resources back in charge of our environment. 
As soon a Rick Snyder took the Governors job he reassembled the Department of Environmental 
Quality and appointed his Director, a political appointee, not necessarily a specialist in the field, but a 
politician. Now we have lot of sick children and residents in Flint that will take the rest of our lives or 
more to repair. How sad it is that Business is making all the decisions for our State, and the 
legislators are working for special interest groups that donate money to their campaign's.

hazardous waste removal, and refused to conduct proper soil sampling to ensure the water supply is indeed safe. They used the 
excuse of not having the funds or personnel resources to fulfil the requirements of their own policy. 

I have security cameras that captured some of the aforementioned episodes contradicting what the MDEQ employees reported 
to the EPA to avoid scrutiny by the federal agency. As it stands now we have a water aquifer with a ten year water movement 
(length of time it takes water in the aquifer to move from one side of the aquifer to the other) and heaps of soil removed from 
the wetland but still in piles adjacent to the original dump site and still on top of the aquifer where leaching occurs. 


Snyder, Rick (GOV) 





The bottom-line is it was evident from the beginning that the MDEQ didn't want to deal with the issue and did everything they 
could to not find evidence that would require further action on their part. In the end, I unenthusiastically accepted five years of 
water testing by the agency because it was apparent that they would not properly remedy the situation. That said, as it stands 
now others downstream who use the same aquifer are unaware of how the situation was handled and the potential for 
chemicals to reach their wells within the ten year water movement. Again this is a high recharge area for the aquifer - meaning 
rain and snow melt saturate the area thereby significantly increasing the infiltration of water into the soil and subsequent 
leaching of embedded chemicals into the aquifer. 

There are three primary MDEQ employees that were complicit in an attempt to conceal what transpired: Bryce Feighner, Fred 
Sellers, and Lee Anne Thor. As stated I have video, email, and other documents that support my accusations. 

I look forward to talking about possible remedies and await your response. 

Respectfully, 



Mattawan

Genesee County Water issue.doc; Flint Emergency Manager Michael Brown says selling city 
water and sewer systems cant be ruled out.docx 


Importance: High 


Governor - 


Just wanted you to be aware of a potential issue - Genesee Co. water supply - that you may get asked about today 
from Flint media. 

Recent news articles below and one attached from earlier this year that talks about then Emergency Manager's Mike 
Brown's comments. Also, attached is brief history and timeline from DEQ and a quick summary below from Treasury as 
they'll be meeting with Flint and Detroit officials tomorrow. 

Bottom line: this has been an ongoing issue and sets up potential conflict between these two communities. Many Flint 
and Genesee Co. officials say it will save the city and region much money; Detroit says it won't be cost-effective and is 
very much opposed. Treasury will be getting the details tomorrow of the proposed pipeline plan and doesn't have an 
opinion yet. Because of the EM situation and particulars, it requires state approval for Flint to participate. Without Flint's 
participation, rest of area likely can't cover. Though sounds like EM Kurtz is now leaning toward moving in the pipeline 
direction. Treasury recommends a very high level response at this time. We agree. 

Please let us know if there's anything else you may need or want on this front.

Subject: RE: Genesee Co water supply project TODAY’S FLINT JOURNAL 

The article is correct, we will be meeting with both proponents and opponents of the potential pipeline project. There 
isn't much to say at this point, Treasury does not have an opinion yet, as we will he getting the full briefing tomorrow. 


Here is what we know: 



■ A group is proposing a water pipeline from Lake Huron to the Flint Metro area, which would eliminate the need to 
purchase water from Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DW5D). 

■•The design and cost estimates have yet to be completed. 

■The City of Flint has contributed about $25--30k towards the costs of the studies. 

-DWSD is opposed to the plan for the obvious reason that they would lose customers. DWSD officials have pointed out 
that a study was done in the 3Q's that concluded that a project of this nature would not be cost effective. 

■This would allow Flint to controi their own water costs and quality and provide opportunities for industrial growth. 

Since Treasury officials have not been briefed on all the information yet, I would keep the statement from the Governor 
rather high-level, something like: 


Treasury officials are meeting tomorrow to get the details of the proposed pipeline plan. Until the ultimate costs are 
known and the various studies have been conducted, the benefits to the citizens of Flint and Genesee County cannot be 
determined. 


Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

GENESEE COUNTY, MI — In a meeting of all the major stakeholders, the city of Flint is expected to 
make its case to the state Thursday that joining a regional effort to build a new pipeline from Lake 
Heron is the best option for Flint's future water. 


The meeting is expected to include representatives from Flint, emergency financial manager Ed 
Kurtz’s administration as well as the Genesee County Drain Commissioner's Office, Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department and thr Michigan Treasury department, Flint officials said this week. 


"The state is looking to bring all the parties to one place to look at the numbers," said Howard Croft, 
Flint’s director of infrastructure. "All the pros and cons and all the people involved will be in the 
room." 

Flint and Genesee County have been getting water from Detroit under a go-year contract that is now 
expired, and are looking to break away because of continuing price increases. 


Officials with the Flint emergency manager's office have been exploring several options for water 
since the city was taken over by the state in December. The options included treated Flint River water 
as well as blending Detroit water with Flint River water. 

Now, Flint authorities say joining with Genesee County officials on hmlcllng a new pipeline from 
Lake Huron is the best bet in order to stabilize Flint, water rates over the long term. 

The pipeline would service a wider region that could also include Lapeer, Sanilac County and Lapeer 
County, called the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


"We're comfortable with the work we’ve done. We believe the numbers bear out," Croft said. "This is 
taking it to the next level, taking it to the state and saving these are our options," 




Kurtz said that, under the emergency financial manager law, the state treasurer has to sign off on any 
deal more than $50,000 — which certainly applies to the pipeline project that's expected to cost the 
three-county region up to $300 million. 

The Genesee County Board of Commissioners took steps last week to borrow up to $35 million to 
cover the initial construction costs for the pipeline. 


Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said he was asked to attend the meeting Thursday 
in Lansing. He said his office will be glad to be there to answer any questions about the KWA 
proposal. 

County officials claim that continuing to buy water from the city of Detroit will cost the region $2.1 
billion during the next 25 years. By building a pipeline, that cost would no more than $1.9 billion over 
the same period. 

"It's cheaper to build our own system than to continue to pay more and more to the city of Detroit," 
Wright said. "This is about the least expensive way for our people to get the best quality water.” 


Croft said the Flint River isn't the best option for Flint's primary source because of concerns about 
capacity during drought conditions and questions about what the city and county would rely on as 
their state-required backup source, which is currently the river. 


If the city were to make the Flint River its primary source, major upgrades would have to be made to 
the dams and other infrastructure, Croft said. 


Blending river water with Detroit water would still leave Flint vulnerable to future rate increases from 
Detroit, he said. 

Going with the KWA pipeline, on the other hand, would mean a fixed water cost, Croft said. 


"A lot of tilings are conditional (with blending)," Croft said. "That's not a good scenario for us. We're 
looking for a long-term solution not a short-term one." 

Still, no decisions have been finalized, he said. 

"The state has to support any decision of this magnitude," he said. "This is about us making the best- 
informed decision we can make

Genesee County Water issue 


BACKGROUND 

The Division of Water and Waste Services, Genesee County Drain Commissioner 
(GCDC) operates a regional water system that presently serves 154,000 residents 
in 19 townships and communities in Genesee County. 

The GCDC purchases water from the City of Flint, which is supplied by the Detroit 
Water and Sewage Department. 

Genesee County and the City receive water via a single 72-inch diameter 
transmission pipeline from the DWSD Lake Huron treatment plant. This pipeline 
was constructed over 40 years ago and has historically been very reliable. 
However, there have been recent repairs that underscore the need for additional 
facilities to ensure water service to the public. 

In addition to the potential reliability problems with the existing pipeline, both 
the City and Genesee County continue to resist rate increases from DWSD . Both 
parties have historically disputed proposed rate increases, and have often 
discussed or investigated alternative sources for drinking water. 

CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF EVENTS 

February 12. 2009 : Original submittal of the GCDC application under Part 327 of 
Act 451, Great Lakes Preservation, for a new withdrawal capacity of 85 million 
gallons per day (MGD) with a request the DEQ commence with the evaluation and 
public notice process was received by the Water Bureau (WB). Information was 
submitted in accordance with Part 327 and GL Charter/Compact requirements for 
"proposals subject to prior notice and consultation." 

March 4. 2009 : At the request of the Office of the Great Lakes (OGL), MDEQ, the 
GCDC was asked to provide additional information in accordance with 
"Preliminary - Temporary Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources 
Compact Rules." 

April 6. 2009 : Amended package of information received by the WB. Information 
was submitted in accordance with above mentioned rules. 



April 24. 2009 : MDEQ correspondence transmitted to the GCDC informing them 
of the "completeness of application." GCDC was notified of DEQ intent to 
conform with the Part 327 requirements for a public comment period of 45 days 
and the rendering of a decision on the permit application within 120 days. August 
24, 2009 established as the deadline for rendering a decision. 

May 26, 2009 : In the spirit of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water 
Resources Agreement (Agreement) and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin 
Water Resources Compact (Compact), the OGL provided notice of the proposed 
withdrawal to states, provinces and Indian Nations and transmits amended 
application packet. The OGL requests comments by July 20, 2009 in order for DEQ 
to meet statutory obligations of Part 327. 

May 28. 2009 ; WB transmits to GCDC a copy of the public notice with cover letter 
requesting the posting of notice on GCDC premises and at the shoreline property 
parcel in Sanilac County (location of shore well and pumping station). WB 
received from GCDC correspondence dated June 4, 2009 affirming compliance 
with posting requirements. 

July 15. 2009 : Public comment period on Part 327 permit application ends. 

July 20. 2009 : Comment period relative to the Agreement/Compact ends. 

August 24. 2009 : Part 327 statutory deadline for rendering a decision on the 
GCDC permit application. 



Flint Emergency Manager Michael Brown says selling city water and sewer systems can't be ruled out 


By Ron Fonger | rfongerl@mlive.com The Flint Journal 
January 29, 2012 at 8:00 AM 

FLINT, Michigan -- The city's emergency manager is considering selling off Flint's water and sewer plants 
to the highest bidder, potentially generating a one-time windfall of millions of dollars to help steady the 
city's shaky finances. 

Emergency Manager Michael Brown confirmed that a sale of the plants is among the options under 
review by his office and said he is "nowhere near a decision on that." 

"We have said everything is on the table," Brown said. "Examining our assets (is) all part of the analysis." 

Brown isn't discussing specifics, including whether a sale might involve the entire water and sewer 
systems, including the pipes that carry waste and water to homes and businesses. 

Word that Brown was considering such a sale came from Genesee County officials, who believe the 
move would complicate and set back the proposed water pipeline to Lake Huron. 

County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jamie Curtis wrote to Brown Jan. 23, saying he was "worried 
that if Flint is considering sale of this asset, that there will be adverse impact on the Karegnondi (Water 
Authority) project." 

Flint joined the Karegnondi Water Authority with the city of Lapeer as well as Genesee, Lapeer and 
Sanilac counties, but has yet to sign a capacity agreement, spelling out how much raw water it will 
commit to buying. 

"The only thing holding back a construction start is Flint's signed capacity agreement," Curtis' letter to 
Brown said. 

As it's designed now, the pipeline has the capacity to carry 85 million gallons of water each day from 
Lake Huron to the Karegnondi communities. 

Curtis called the pipeline "one of the most important economic initiatives currently underway" and 
asked Brown to commit the city to it "as soon as you are able." 

"We cannot miss another construction season for the project," the letter says. 

Brown said he's aware "the county wants (a decision) as soon as possible. We are doing everything we 
can to (do) it fast." 

Brown said the city is not currently involved in talks with a specific potential buyer for its water and 
sewer systems. 

Flint Councilman Scott Kincaid said several council members agreed with Mayor Dayne Walling that the 
city should commit to purchase up to 25 million gallons per day from the pipeline. 

But since Brown was appointed emergency manager by Gov. Rick Snyder, Walling and the council no 
longer have authority to make such decisions. 



I think (Brown) is just looking," Kincaid said of discussion about selling the water and sewer plants. 
People get appraisals on their houses. It doesn't mean they are going to sell them." 


The councilman said he hasn't been told that the water and sewer sales were under discussion and 
compared the idea to privatizing garbage collection, leaving city residents at the mercy of for-profit 
company. 

"It's not something I would do," Kincaid said. "I think we are better off coming up with an agreement for 
the KWA." 

County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said he knows the city's is investigating a sale of its plants 
because he was asked if the county would be interested in buying. 

"I said no," Wright said, adding that his office might have interest in operating the city's water and sewer 
systems as an alternative. 

"The city should keep its facilities," Wright said. "It's self-sustaining (and) one of the only assets that 
generates (positive revenue)." 

The drain commissioner said he believes Brown will decide that committing to the water pipeline is in 
the city's best option. 

Although no purchase price was discussed, Wright said both the water and sewer plants would cost in 
excess of $50 million to replace. 

Wright said the KWA pipeline project wouldn't automatically collapse if Flint decided to drop out as a 
partner but said the project would have to be re-evaluated and possibly down-sized. 

The drain commissioner said he prefers to wait -- even if it takes until the second half of 2012 -- for 
Brown to make a decision he's comfortable rather than pressuring him to make a decision quickly. 

County officials have advocated for the pipeline because of rising prices for treated drinking water that 
is currently pumped here by the city of Detroit. 

Assuming water use is static and that the city of Detroit takes on no new debt, Wright said he 
anticipates the cost to Flint and Genesee County will rise from $22.3 million in 2012 to $35.3 million by 
2016.

For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Officially Begins Using Flint River 
as Temporary Primary Water Source 


Flint, Michigan - April 25, 2014 - For the first time in fifty years, the City of Flint is using the Flint River — part 
of the Saginaw River watershed — as a primary water source for city residents. Today the valve to the pipeline 
from Detroit was closed and the Flint River officially became Flint’s water supply. The temporary switchover is 
scheduled to support the city’s primary water needs for the next two years while construction of the 
forthcoming pipeline from Lake Huron is completed by Karegnondi Water Authority. Officials from the City of 
Flint, the Genesee County Drain Commission and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality were all 
on hand to witness the historic event. 


The Flint River was once the primary source of water for city residents up to the 1960s. Over the past 40 
years, it has provided water to city residents as a back-up to water provided to us by Detroit. During 


l 



our partnership with Detroit, Flint has had to transition to the use of the Flint River for residential water on a 
few different occasions, with the most recent temporary switchover happening in 2009. Each temporary stint on 
local water proved three things to city employees and residents alike: That a transition to local river water could 
be done seamlessly, and that it was both sensible and safe for us to use our own water as a primary water source 
in Flint. 


Even with a proven track record of providing perfectly good water for Flint, there still remains lingering 
uncertainty about the quality of the water. In an effort to dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint 
River and its viability as a residential water resource, there have been numerous studies and tests conducted on 
its water by several different independent organizations. In addition to what has been found in independent 
studies, it is also the responsibility of the City of Flint Water Service Center to continually test the water 
provided to city residents. Michael Prysby of the Michigan DEQ Office of Drinking Water verified that “the 
quality of the water being put out meets all of our drinking water standards and Flint water is safe to drink.” 


For nearly 10 years Mike Glasgow has worked in the laboratory at the City of Flint Water Service Center. He 
has run countless tests on our drinking water to ensure its safety for public use. Mike has not only conducted 
tests on water provided to us by Detroit, but also on local water from nearby rivers, lakes and streams including 
the Flint River. When asked if over the last decade if he has seen any abnormalities of major concern in the 
water, his response was an emphatic, “No.” In his words, “there has been nothing seen that was of major 
concern,” during his ongoing tenure working in the lab. “The tests results have shown that our water is not only 
safe, but of the high quality that Flint customers have come to expect,” announced DPW Director Howard 
Croft, “we are proud of the end result.” 


Apart from the water plant’s devotion to ensuring that our water is good, Flint is doubly blessed in 
having the Flint River Watershed Coalition as a separate organization dedicated to monitoring the 
overall welfare of local bodies of water, overseeing more than 30 different nearby locations. Rebecca 
Fedewa has been director of the watershed coalition since 2008. By virtue of her passion for her 
work and her position on the board, she is very conversant with the condition of the Flint River. In her words, 
“The Flint River is increasingly healthy, and completely suitable as a drinking water source.” Fedewa and 
FRWC are working closely with the city “to monitor flows and habitats between the intake and the waste water 
treatment plant to ensure there are minimal to no impacts to the overall health of the river.”

FRWC also invites city residents to be a part of their monitoring exercises during this spring in order “to gain 
firsthand knowledge in the health and vitality of our Flint River.” Mayor Dayne Walling invited everyone at 
today’s event to toast to Flint’s water. “It’s regular, good, pure drinking water, and it’s right in our backyard,” 
said Mayor Walling, “this is the first step in the right direction for Flint, as we take this monumental step 
forward in controlling the future of our community’s most precious resource.”

Even with a proven track record of providing perfectly good water for Flint, 
there still remains lingering uncertainty about the quality of the water. In an effort 
to dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint River and its viability as 
a residential water resource, there have been numerous studies and tests conducted on 
its water by several different independent organizations. In addition to what has been 
found in independent studies, it is also the responsibility of the City of Flint Water 
Service Center to continually test the water provided to city residents. Michael Prysby 
of the Michigan DEQ Office of Drinking Water verified that “the quality of the water being 
put out meets all of our drinking water standards and Flint water is safe to drink.” 

For nearly 10 years Mike Glasgow has worked in the laboratory at the City of Flint 
Water Service Center. Fie has run countless tests on our drinking water to ensure its 
safety for public use. Mike has not only conducted tests on water provided to us by 
Detroit, but also on local water from nearby rivers, lakes and streams including the Flint 
River. When asked if over the last decade if he has seen any abnormalities of major 
concern in the water, his response was an emphatic, “No.” In his words, “there has been 
nothing seen that was of major concern,” during his ongoing tenure working in the lab. 
“The tests results have shown that our water is not only safe, but of the high quality that 
Flint customers have come to expect,” announced DPW Director Howard Croft, “we are 
proud of the end result.” 

Apart from the water plant’s devotion to ensuring that our water is good, Flint is doubly 
blessed in having the Flint River Watershed Coalition as a separate organization

dedicated to monitoring the overall welfare of local bodies of water, overseeing more 
than 30 different nearby locations. Rebecca Fedewa has been director of the watershed 
coalition since 2008. By virtue of her passion for her work and her position on the board, 
she is very conversant with the condition of the Flint River. In her words, “The Flint River 
is increasingly healthy, and completely suitable as a drinking water 
source.” Fedewa and FRWC are working closely with the city “to monitor flows and 
habitats between the intake and the waste water treatment plant to ensure there are 
minimal to no impacts to the overall health of the river.” 

FRWC also invites city residents to be a part of their monitoring exercises during 
this spring in order “to gain firsthand knowledge in the health and vitality of our Flint 
River.” Mayor Dayne Walling invited everyone at today’s event to toast to Flint’s water. 
“It’s regular, good, pure drinking water, and it’s right in our backyard,” said Mayor 
Walling, “this is the first step in the right direction for Flint, as we take this monumental 
step forward in controlling the future of our community’s most precious resource.”

Dennis - in response to your earlier email; Wayne’s guys came up with a ballpark estimate for 
reconnecting to DWSD. Let me emphasize 'ballpark'. They used your assumptions & they 
talked to Natasha H. after 5:00. Bottom line... the igpamated COSt 1$ appro* to 

reconnect until June 16. 


These numbers on their surface seem much improved over previous DWSD $offers. [Is Daddow 
in the loop on this ?] We need to give some more thought as to whether this is all 
inclusive, e.g., there might be some costs from turning down operations at the plant 


I am being told this can happen in a relatively short time i.e., less than a week. Which seems 
aggressive. Obviously that does not mean the lead concerns nor discolored water, etc goes 
away in a week. The pipe section they sold to the county won't be an impediment to this deal. 


There apparently are no 'upfront' costs we need to worry about. In theory, it seems like it can 
be paid over the 9-10 months (vs a lump sum). But I am not clear Dennis on those couple 
ideas/sources the Mayor & Senator mentioned i.e., at this point I am not sure where the 
$10. 5mm comes from. 


My guess is we will keep refining this estimate. Let us know if you need anything else. Again, 
"credit " Wayne's guys for pulling this together quickly.

Question to consider 


It appears on the surface (without the deep dive we'll definitely do on it) that for $11M we 

can reconnect to DWSD system for the intervening time before KWA comes on line. That may 

well be the only way to bring any confidence back to the community. If you choose to do so, 
what if we created or expanding some revolving fund where Flint wouldn't have to start 
repaying until 2020 or whenever in the future to stretch the liability? If we needed to have 

a guarantee perhaps we could use the Escheats of the bottle bill money as a set aside or 

guarantor without having to touch the principal?

Ananich wants you to add Carl Levin to the task force on Flint Water. You might want to consider that. Carl isn't going 
to go to every meeting, he's a pretty fair individual with a long relationship with Sikkema and Kolb, and, Ananich can 
hardly balk at the findings if Carl is inside the tent.

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Recommendation 
KRS version of Snyder Letter 2 (l).docx 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

We want to thank you for the recent conference call between members of the Flint Water Advisory Task Force 
(FWATF), yourself, and members of your administration. Attached is a follow-up letter to that conference call 
outlining an initial set of recommendations that we believe should be implemented in the very near future to 
focus the state's efforts to protect the public health in Flint. 

We both acknowledge and appreciate your personal interest in this issue and your commitment, not only to 
assisting the Task Force in our review, but— most importantly— to ensuring that the full measure of state 
resources are brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully, 

Ken Sikkema

December 7, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with representatives of 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Michigan Department of Health 
and Fluman Services ( M DH HS) to discuss elements of the 10-point Action Plan designed to address 
various issues related to the ongoing public health protection challenges precipitated by lead in the Flint 
water supply. These discussions were held at our request as part of our task to make recommendations 
to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing mitigation efforts. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force 
participated in a conference call with yourself, members of the Administration, and representatives of 
these agencies to discuss the progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other 
related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Flealth Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing. We will continue to assess state and local efforts and make recommendations regarding 
specific steps that we believe are warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates 
responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to 
facilitate this larger framework, which should address the following: 

1. The need for MDFIFIS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for 
contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups 
regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— potentially independent of any one 
particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you, Governor— be established to 
provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. 
For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports on the 
goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health 
providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as 
well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the 
development of that dashboard. 



We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in 
communication on this issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested 
dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance of our final report, we would like to ensure the 
independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding 
community trust in state actions. 

We appreciate your personal interest in this issue, commitment to assisting the Task Force in our 
review, and— most importantly— commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are 
brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully yours,

Dear Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 

Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote public health and 
protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they relate to reducing 
lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is more work that must be done to 
ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and 
Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health Department, local schools, and our partners 
in the non-profit community. 

These partners are making progress, and we know we must always strive to improve practices and communication for 
continual improvement. 

You make a solid suggestion about establishing a person who is independent of any one of the involved state agencies to 
serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am recommending that Harvey Hollins, director of the Office 
of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the issues and the challenges faced by our cities and 
will be effective in this role. Senior members of our executive team will continue to engage with your task force and 
provide direction and support to Harvey to ensure you will have continued support and cooperation. We also have 
retained Chris DeWitt, a veteran communications specialist, to strengthen community outreach efforts to make sure 
residents have access to the information they need. 

I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more accessible to the 
Flint community. These are critical measures that can be used as we look the challenges and progress in Flint, but also 
can be a part of efforts moving forward in other areas of our state. It's important that people have confidence that we 
are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to improve interaction among city, state and 
federal agencies. We also will continue to work with the medical community to consider how we can work together on 
wraparound needs of children who might experience health problems. 

People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the water coming out of 
their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - at all levels - is working effectively to 
protect them.

I thank you again for investing your time and expertise in this vitally important effort.

I. Confirm key stakeholders that should convene on a regular basis to do the following: 

a. Identify resources and support required to manage continued testing, cognitive 
assessment, updates on progress, impediments, community outreach, etc. 

b. Assess delivery of resources protocols and adjust (door to door, neighborhood centers, 
etc.) 

c. Agree a communications strategy within the stakeholder community and aggressively 
inform the residents of Flint of resources available and consequences of inaction. 

II. Create a short/medium and long term plan to capture roles and responsibilities at the local, 
county, state (and federal if appropriate) levels which will be reviewed and approved by the key 
stakeholder body. 

III. Be responsive to mayor, media, residents and all stakeholders about what currently is being 
done and how the way forward is being envisioned and agreed by stakeholder leadership. 

IV. Work to eliminate duplication of effort and ensure that members of the science community 
engaged in assessing and protecting the public health have unfettered access to data, reports, 
etc. and establish a mutually agreeable process to surface and resolve conflicting interpretations 
of data when it occurs. 

V. Coordinate with State departments (DHHS, DEQ, Executive Office) to secure funding needed and 
subject matter resources to ensure long term monitoring and remediation efforts. 

VI. Ensure that the recommendations of the After Action Task Force are executed. 

VII. Provide weekly status updates to Governor Snyder and members of his team charged with 
supporting the Chief Coordinator. 

VIII. Determine how what is being done in Flint is relevant to other communities and needs to be 
shared as part of a state wide strategy. This may also impact future policy development to 
address long term infrastructure remediation.

Attached Letter from Flint Water Advisory Task Force 
FWATF-Snyder Letter %28122915%29.pdf 


Dear Governor: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted considerable 
time and effort to our review of the contamination of the Flint Water supply. Our focus has been on assessing 
what happened, why it happened, and what is needed to prevent any recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in the state 
We have also, as you know, been assessing on-going mitigation efforts. 

Attached is a letter reporting our finding as to who bears the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint. 
We are sending this letter now because it has become clear to us that ascribing responsibility and ensuring 
accountability is both critical and urgent, and simply cannot wait for our final report. Establishing responsibility 
and accountability is the first step in re-establishing the trust between the citizens of Flint and their government 
and the agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. The current level of distrust also serves to 
compromise the effective delivery of protected services designed to address ongoing public health issues. 

Thank you for the support you have given us and your demonstrated commitment to respond to our findings and 
recommendations.

December 29, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 



This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 
this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 

A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 


2 



legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 


We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 
time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 

We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDFIFIS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community. 

Respectfully yours.

Good Afternoon Ms. McCormick, 


We appreciate your response to our additional questions, Mr. Kurtz 
would like to know if you could provide a quick summary to the 
following inquiry. 

On page two, in paragraph one, it is stated that "the total Water 
Utility Costs through 2042 are only $3,215.04 million, or $908.85 
million less than the KWA scenario." 

We are curious what formula DWSD used to calculate the $908.85 
million dollars less than KWA? 


l 



We are meeting this afternoon to review your responses and any 
additional information on this issue would be greatly appreciated. 


Thank you.

DWSD / KWA Executive Summary Outline 


Premise and Approach 

• Review most recent audited financial statements to establish baseline water revenues 
from Flint and Genesee County (GCDC), and how such revenues are applied. 

• Estimate how baseline will be impacted under two scenarios 

o Continued purchase of treated water from DWSD 

o Construction of new KWA raw water supply system and treated water supply 
system for Genesee County and construction of modifications to Flint Water 
Treatment Plant 

• Compare estimated short, mid, and long term financial projections for each scenario 
Assumptions - common to both scenarios 

• Current application of revenues is most accurately depicted by published audited 
financial statements for most recently fiscal years 

o FY ended December 31, 201 1 for Genesee County Drain Commission (GCDC) 
o FY ended June 30, 2012 for City of Flint 

• Most recently audited figures for Flint / Genesse County operating expenses, capital 
expenses, etc. are representative - inflate at 4.51%, consistent with TYJT report 

Assumptions - DWSD Scenario 

• DWSD water rate schedule 

o DWSD rate structure to Flint / Genesee County is amended to reflect 4/24/2013 
DWSD proposal, adjusted to reflect immediate reservation of 60 mgd capacity 
o DWSD rate escalation (for commodity and standby elements) at 4.7%, consistent 
with TYJT Report 

Assumptions - KWA Scenario 

• KWA scenario begins in FY 2017, at which time purchased water from DWSD would 
cease 

• Other than normal rate adjustments DWSD does not amend rate stmcture to Flint / 
GCDC 

• KWA scenario costs 

o KWA Raw Water Pipeline and Appurtenances Construction = $357.58 million, 
consistent with TYJT report 

o Flint Water Treatment Plant Construction Improvements = $7.1 million, 
consistent with TYJT report 

o GCDC Water Treatment Plant Construction Improvements = $110 million, 
consistent with 2009 KWA Preliminary Engineering Report 
o All construction costs are financed in terms set forth in the TYJT Report 

■ 3 years of capitalized interest 

■ Fully funded bond reserve account 

■ Bond issuance expenses at 2.25% 

o In addition, revenues are assumed to need to generate 1.20x coverage of annual 
debt service 

o Flint Water Treatment Plant Operating costs = $8.27 million starting in 2017, 
consistent with TYJT report 

o GCDC Water Treatment Plant Operating costs = $1.82 million starting in 2017, 
consistent with unit costs from the 2009 KWA Preliminary Engineering Report

The Flint water statement 


Here is the statement. It's going to senior and executive staff, plus directors, very soon. It will go to the media around 
2:30 p.m. 

Rich will respond to the task force in person at tomorrow's task force meeting. We don't plan a written response; 
however, I'll be compiling talking points from various senior staff for Rich. 

The statement: 

When I became aware that the city of Flint's water showed elevated lead levels and that the state's handling of the 
situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the Great Lakes Water Authority and 
appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 

The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of Flint, Genesee 
County, state and federal officials. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, it has made me aware of some interim findings and 
corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe 
and informed. 

We'll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns. 

In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I've determined that it's appropriate to accept it. 
I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force. 

But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific 
community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services 
to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping us improve Flint water. Let's 
share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at accurate and mutually supported 
conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we're using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint 
residents have safe drinking water and that we're taking steps to protect their health over the short and long term. 

I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan citizens to know 
that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure. 

I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That's why I'm taking the actions today to ensure a 
culture of openness and trust. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in 
other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state 
can offer assistance. 

These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our task force. 

When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything we can to protect the well- 
being of our citizens.

We need Treasury to work with Dan and Flint on a clear side by side comparison of the health benefits and costs of 
GLWA vs. a more optimized Flint system. Also, we need to look at what financing mechanisms are available to Flint to 
pay for any higher cost actions. Please get people working on these two issues ASAP.

have to start repaying until 2020 or whenever in the future to stretch the liability? If we needed to have a guarantee

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan.” 


i 



Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance,

the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation, city form partnership to fund switch until KWA is ready 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority 
as the source of the city's drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is completed, Gov. Rick Snyder 
said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be completed. The Flint city 
government will provide $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 

"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The technical experts helping the city on its water 
advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for 
children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's 
willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous commitment, and the dedication of all parties to 
come together to protect Flint families and children." 

The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today also committed an 
additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and 
hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state's help to fund the reconnection and to assist with health and infrastructure issues. 
Flint's move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi 
Water Authority is completed next summer. 

"It's heartening to know so many people are working at so many levels to bring safe, clean water back to Flint," Mott 
Foundation President Ridgway White said. "We believe that reconnecting the city's water supply to Lake Huron is the 
right and necessary thing to do, and we're glad we could help the state and the city make it happen." 


l 



The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large bodies of 
water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can 
sometimes be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority water already has additional 
corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city's problem with lead service lines or aging 
infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, 
some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

"Reconnecting to Detroit is the fastest way to deliver clean, safe water to Flint and stabilize the infrastructure system," 
Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said. "I appreciate the state, the Mott Foundation, Detroit, and the county's participation in a 
solution for Flint's water problems. The health and safety of Flint's families, children and seniors is my top priority and 
reconnecting to Detroit is a major step that the city could not take alone given budget constraints." 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in 
a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate 
information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. For 
residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County 
Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all 
four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions 
about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 
p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the water 
until it's as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples 
taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and 
filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also 
available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at www.rnichigan.gov/flintwat&r.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to 
Detroit water provides best 
protection for public health in 

Flint 


State, Mott Foundation, city form partnership to fund 
switch until KWA is ready 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by 
reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the 
city's drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is 
completed, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 


Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to 
provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 million needed to reconnect with 
the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be 
completed. The Flint city government will provide $2 million and the 
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 


"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The 
technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this 
move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public 
health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 


2 


of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's 
willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous 
commitment, and the dedication of all parties to come together to 
protect Flint families and children." 

Flint city leaders requested the state's help to fund the reconnection 
and to assist with health and infrastructure issues. Flint's move to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per 
month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

"It's heartening to know so many people are working at so many levels 
to bring safe, clean water back to Flint," Mott Foundation President 
Ridgway White said. "We believe that reconnecting the city's water 
supply to Lake Huron is the right and necessary thing to do, and we're 
glad we could help the state and the city make it happen." 

The move to Detroit water v w b i ch - i s - dra - wt r from Lak e Huro% 5 
llllillliiiiiiilll many public health benefits. As large bodies of 
water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large 
rain events and other runoff issues that can sometimes be present in 
shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority water 
already has additional corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat 
the insides of pipes and llMYi lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve 
the city's problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will 
take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate 
corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could 
experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing 
are replaced. 

"Reconnecting to Detroit is the fastest way to deliver clean, safe water 
to Flint and stabilize the infrastructure system," Flint Mayor Dayne 
Walling said. "I appreciate the state, the Mott Foundation, Detroit, and 
the county's participation in a solution for Flint's water problems. The 
health and safety of Flint's families, children and seniors is my top 
priority and reconnecting to Detroit is a major step that the city could 
not take alone given budget constraints." 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will 
continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action 
plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure W m ^ i jjjg H i— 

ADDmOrm$mr£ACrrWI^The Michigan Departments of 
Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today also 
committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing 
through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring 
additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in 
drinking water. 


3 



Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union 
St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not 
currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are 
available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. 
Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through 
Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions 
about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended 
hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning 
on the cold water tap and running the water until it's as cold as it will go. 
Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially 
mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening 
program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 
buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the 
federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is 
committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these 
schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using 
bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, 
including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any 
Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, 
is available at www , m ic h iga n.gov/fl i ntwater .

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review 
state, federal and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus 

on steps to protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory 
task force charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer 
recommendations for future guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 


i 



Taskforce members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and 
environmental protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving 
will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the 
Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water 
Authority is a good first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder 
said. “Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be key to continuing work on the 
comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents in Flint and all 
of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an 
unbiased report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve 
practices to ensure all residents have access to safe, clean water. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in 
public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both 
the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has 
also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 
environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb 
represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor 
City Council. He has been president of the MEC for six years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford 
School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor 
of health management and policy at the School of Public Health. He previously served as the 
chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health 
and Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein 
Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. 
Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and municipal 
adviser for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and issuance of $1.7 billion in sewer 
warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed 
Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, wastewater and stormwater 
utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott 
Children’s Health Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of 
Medicine and has been in practice for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee 
County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He 
has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on behalf of children from the 
Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues 
and addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with 
lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with 
the phosphate corrosion control.

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined 
on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters 
and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The 
Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing 
to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water 
customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking 
water.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit 
water provides best protection for public 

health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation, city form partnership to fund switch until 

KWA is ready 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with 
the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city's drinking water until the 
Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is completed, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 
million, of the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority through next 
summer, when the KWA is expected to be completed. The Flint city government will 
provide $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 

"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The technical experts 
helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort 
today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's 
willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous commitment, and 
the dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children." 

Flint city leaders requested the state's help to fund the reconnection and to assist with 
health and infrastructure issues. Flint's move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is 
completed next summer. 

"It's heartening to know so many people are working at so many levels to bring safe, 
clean water back to Flint," Mott Foundation President Ridgway White said. "We believe 
that reconnecting the city's water supply to take HutOh is the right and necessary thing

assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff 
will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute 
filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. At the

County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He 
has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on behalf of children from the 
Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues 
and addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with 
lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with 
the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined 
on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters 
and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The 
Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing 
to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water 
customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking 
water.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation, city form partnership to fund switch until KWA is ready 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority 
as the source of the city's drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is completed, Gov. Rick Snyder 
said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be completed. The Flint city 
government will provide $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 

"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The technical experts helping the city on its water 
advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for 
children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's 
willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous commitment, and the dedication of all parties to 
come together to protect Flint families and children." 

Flint city leaders requested the state's help to fund the reconnection and to assist with health and infrastructure issues. 
Flint's move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi 
Water Authority is completed next summer. 

"It's heartening to know so many people are working at so many levels to bring safe, clean water back to Flint," Mott 
Foundation President Ridgway White said. "We believe that reconnecting the city's water supply to Lake Huron is the 
right and necessary thing to do, and we're glad we could help the state and the city make it happen." 

The move to Detroit water r ' Whteb ' iS ' drawn ' fFOmi^ ^ l ipi i ^ ^^^Mp b TO CARR? many public health benefits. As 
large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff 
issues that can sometimes be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority water already 
has additional corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and tifrAll lead from leaching into the 
water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city's problem with lead service lines or aging 
infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, 
some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

"Reconnecting to Detroit is the fastest way to deliver clean, safe water to Flint and stabilize the infrastructure system," 
Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said. "I appreciate the state, the Mott Foundation, Detroit, and the county's participation in a 
solution for Flint's water problems. The health and safety of Flint's families, children and seniors is my top priority and 
reconnecting to Detroit is a major step that the city could not take alone given budget constraints." 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in 
a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate 
information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. TO HEBE FOR FLOW OH APOHIOMAL 

STATE ACTIQN^The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today also 
committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water 
customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. For 
residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County 
Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all 
four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions 
about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 
p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 




Other aood practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the water 
until it's as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples 
taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and 
filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also 
available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at www.michigan.gov/fiintwater .

Team - 

A few things based on other dept edits. See below highlighted. I believe 
these are necessary and help. But please review and make sure makes 
sense to you as well. 

Also - the Detroit system pulls from both Lake Huron and the Detroit 
River. Mott is working on amending Ridgway's quote. See below for info:

The water system draws fresh water from the Great Lakes System, with

Good evening Governor and team, 

Here's the most updated version of the press release, including quotes 
and incorporating suggestions from Mayor Walling and the Mott 
Foundation friends. Please let me know if there are any other changes. 
Thank you for your assistance.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to 
Detroit water provides best 
protection for public health in 

Flint 


State, Mott Foundation, city form partnership to fund 
switch until KWA is ready 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by 
reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the 
city's drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is 
completed, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 


Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to 
provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 million needed to reconnect with 
the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be 
completed. The Flint city government will provide $2 million and the 
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 


"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The 
technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this 
move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public 
health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 


2 


of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's 
willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous 
commitment, and the dedication of all parties to come together to 
protect Flint families and children." 

Flint city leaders requested the state's help to fund the reconnection 
and to assist with health and infrastructure issues. Flint's move to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per 
month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

"It's heartening to know so many people are working at so many levels 
to bring safe, clean water back to Flint," Mott Foundation President 
Ridgway White said. "We believe that reconnecting the city's water 
supply to Lake Huron is the right and necessary thing to do, and we're 
glad we could help the state and the city make it happen." 

The move to Detroit water v w b i ch - i s - dra - wt r from Lak e Huro% 5 
llllillliiiiiiilll many public health benefits. As large bodies of 
water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large 
rain events and other runoff issues that can sometimes be present in 
shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority water 
already has additional corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat 
the insides of pipes and llMYi lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve 
the city's problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will 
take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate 
corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could 
experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing 
are replaced. 

"Reconnecting to Detroit is the fastest way to deliver clean, safe water 
to Flint and stabilize the infrastructure system," Flint Mayor Dayne 
Walling said. "I appreciate the state, the Mott Foundation, Detroit, and 
the county's participation in a solution for Flint's water problems. The 
health and safety of Flint's families, children and seniors is my top 
priority and reconnecting to Detroit is a major step that the city could 
not take alone given budget constraints." 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will 
continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action 
plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure W m ^ i jjjg H i— 

ADDmOrm$mr£ACrrWI^The Michigan Departments of 
Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today also 
committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing 
through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring 
additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in 
drinking water. 


3 



Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union 
St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not 
currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are 
available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. 
Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through 
Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions 
about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended 
hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning 
on the cold water tap and running the water until it's as cold as it will go. 
Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially 
mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening 
program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 
buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the 
federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is 
committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these 
schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using 
bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, 
including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any 
Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, 
is available at www , m ic h iga n.gov/fl i ntwater .

Fw: Media Call: Ron Fonger - Flint Journal (Deadline ASAP)-D. Earley Response 


All, 

Mr. Earley asked me to share with you his response to the below media inquiry. It was as follows: 

"The decision to separate from DWSD and go with the Karegnondi Water Authority, including the decision to 
pump Flint river water in the interim, were both a part of a long-term plan that was approved by Flint's Mayor, 
and confirmed by a City Council vote of 7-1 in March of 2013 - a full seven months before I began my term as 
Emergency Manager. That vote was supported and signed into emergency order by then Emergency Manager 
Edward Kurtz on March 29, 2013. It was my responsibility to implement the previously accepted and approved 
plan as the contract with DWSD expired in April 2014 during my term as EM. It did not fall to me to second 
guess or to invalidate the actions that were taken prior to my appointment. An even bigger concern that 
everyone should be focused on moving forward is what is done in the long-term to replace the crumbling 
water distribution system that exits throughout Flint and Genesee County." 

Please let him know if you have any questions. 

Thanks.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review 
state, federal and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus 

on steps to protect residents 


i 


LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory 
task force charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer 
recommendations for future guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Taskforce members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and 
environmental protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving 
will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the 
Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water 
Authority is a good first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder 
said. “Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be key to continuing work on the 
comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents in Flint and all 
of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an

Governor Snyder, 

In the interest of being sensitive to the unforeseen problems that will affect children of this Flint Water Crisis, I am 
formally requesting you to forgive the debt balance currently imposed on the Flint Community Schools. I make this 
request because this school district will have the majority burden of addressing issues relating to the lead intrusion into 
the blood of children in this school system. There will be untold problems for years to come that will require an already 
overwhelmed school district to be required to meet the needs of these children who are victims of this disaster. 


Respectfully,

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation, city form partnership to fund switch until KWA is ready 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority 
as the source of the city's drinking water until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is completed, Gov. Rick Snyder 
said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority through next summer, when the KWA is expected to be completed. The Flint city 
government will provide $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 

"All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water," Snyder said. "The technical experts helping the city on its water 
advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for 
children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit's 
willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation's generous commitment, and the dedication of all parties to 
come together to protect Flint families and children." 


l 


The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today also committed an 
additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and 
hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state's help to fund the reconnection and to assist with health and infrastructure issues. 
Flint's move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi 
Water Authority is completed next summer. 

"It's heartening to know so many people are working at so many levels to bring safe, clean water back to Flint," Mott 
Foundation President Ridgway White said. "We believe that reconnecting the city's water supply to Lake Huron is the 
right and necessary thing to do, and we're glad we could help the state and the city make it happen." 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large bodies of 
water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can 
sometimes be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority water already has additional 
corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city's problem with lead service lines or aging 
infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, 
some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

"Reconnecting to Detroit is the fastest way to deliver clean, safe water to Flint and stabilize the infrastructure system," 
Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said. "I appreciate the state, the Mott Foundation, Detroit, and the county's participation in a 
solution for Flint's water problems. The health and safety of Flint's families, children and seniors is my top priority and 
reconnecting to Detroit is a major step that the city could not take alone given budget constraints." 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in 
a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate 
information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations. For 
residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County 
Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all 
four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions 
about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 
p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the water 
until it's as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples 
taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and 
filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also 
available for any Flint resident.

Dear Governor Snyder: 

We want to thank you for the recent conference call between members of the Flint Water Advisory Task Force 
(FWATF), yourself, and members of your administration. Attached is a follow-up letter to that conference call 
outlining an initial set of recommendations that we believe should be implemented in the very near future to 
focus the state's efforts to protect the public health in Flint. 

We both acknowledge and appreciate your personal interest in this issue and your commitment, not only to 
assisting the Task Force in our review, but— most importantly— to ensuring that the full measure of state

Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with representatives of 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Michigan Department of Health 
and Fluman Services ( M DH HS) to discuss elements of the 10-point Action Plan designed to address 
various issues related to the ongoing public health protection challenges precipitated by lead in the Flint 
water supply. These discussions were held at our request as part of our task to make recommendations 
to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing mitigation efforts. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force 
participated in a conference call with yourself, members of the Administration, and representatives of 
these agencies to discuss the progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other 
related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Flealth Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing. We will continue to assess state and local efforts and make recommendations regarding 
specific steps that we believe are warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates 
responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to 
facilitate this larger framework, which should address the following: 

1. The need for MDFIFIS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for 
contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups 
regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— potentially independent of any one 
particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you, Governor— be established to 
provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. 
For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports on the 
goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health 
providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as 
well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the 
development of that dashboard. 



We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in 
communication on this issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested 
dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance of our final report, we would like to ensure the 
independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding 
community trust in state actions. 

We appreciate your personal interest in this issue, commitment to assisting the Task Force in our 
review, and— most importantly— commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are 
brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully yours,

participated in a conference call with yourself, members of the Administration, and representatives of 
these agencies to discuss the progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other 
related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Flealth Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing. We will continue to assess state and local efforts and make recommendations regarding 
specific steps that we believe are warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates 
responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to 
facilitate this larger framework, which should address the following: 

1. The need for MDFIFIS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for 
contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups 
regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— potentially independent of any one 
particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you, Governor— be established to 
provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. 
For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports on the 
goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health 
providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as 
well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the 
development of that dashboard. 



We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in 
communication on this issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested 
dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance of our final report, we would like to ensure the 
independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding 
community trust in state actions. 

We appreciate your personal interest in this issue, commitment to assisting the Task Force in our 
review, and— most importantly— commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are 
brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully yours, 


Flint Water Advisory Task Force: 

Dr. Matt Davis 

Chris Kolb

feedback.

Regards, Meegan 


Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly posed by Sen. Jim 
Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The questions came as the OAG conducts an 
audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint River as an interim 
water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency purposes in 2006. The treated 
water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint had never tested its effect on the distribution 
system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only one email 
exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control program; the DEQ 
responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion control. DEQ later explained that the first answer was referring to 
its LCR program, in which it monitors a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two 
consecutive six-month periods to determine if corrosion treatment is necessary. The report says there's no reason to 
believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared 
to have notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the 
switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six-month 
monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: 
corrosion controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month sampling results 
arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 

DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water 
samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., residences with lead service lines, soldering or plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's 
certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should consider an independent verification of the sampling pool 
or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. Water 
samples came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this 
Wednesday (12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six-month review. It 
was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It was also appropriate for DEQ to 
require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't contain overly stagnant water. 

Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. The report said it's 
tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy.

program, in which it monitors a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month periods to determine if corrosion 
treatment is necessary. The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA 
employees appeared to have notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the switch to Flint water, but from past 
experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six-month monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion 
control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot: 
corrosion controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch. 

DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month sampling results arrived in late March 2015 and showed the 
water exceeded acceptable lead levels. 

DEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water samples from tier 1 homes, i.e., 
residences with lead service lines, soldering or plumbing. Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should consider an 
independent verification of the sampling pool or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1. 
Water samples came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this Wednesday (12/30). 

There's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six-month review. It was appropriate for DEQ to do so 
because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It was also appropriate for DEQ to require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't 
contain overly stagnant water.

Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period. The report said it's tough to determine if the lateness of the 
sampling affects the accuracy. 

The report ends with an excellent timeline. I have attached the report in case you want to review the timeline on page 11.

Dan - 

Dave shared with me the draft of the report. We're eager for the OAG to release this. Meanwhile, I wrote a summary of 
the conclusions for the Governor's senior staff. Could you read this for accuracy? I'd very much appreciate your 
feedback.

Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly posed by Sen. Jim 
Ananich's office (the auditor added a few questions in the 11-page report). The questions came as the OAG conducts an 
audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance's handling of the Flint water crisis. 

Conclusions: 

While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline, it didn't designate the Flint River as an interim 
water source. But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency purposes in 2006. The treated 
water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP, but Flint had never tested its effect on the distribution 
system. 

In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only one email 
exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control program; the DEQ 
responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion control. DEQ later explained that the first answer was referring to 
its LCR program, in which it monitors a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two 
consecutive six-month periods to determine if corrosion treatment is necessary. The report says there's no reason to 
believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared 
to have notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation. 

DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the 
switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six-month 
monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation. It then clarified the rule; the upshot:

In the interest of being sensitive to the unforeseen problems that will affect children of this Flint Water Crisis, I am 
formally requesting you to forgive the debt balance currently imposed on the Flint Community Schools. I make this 
request because this school district will have the majority burden of addressing issues relating to the lead intrusion into

l 


Outline of Role and Responsibility— Harvey Hollins 

Flint After Action Task Force and Local/County/State Coordination 

Key Activities Draft 


I. Confirm key stakeholders that should convene on a regular basis to do the following: 

a. Identify resources and support required to manage continued testing, cognitive 
assessment, updates on progress, impediments, community outreach, etc. 

b. Assess delivery of resources protocols and adjust (door to door, neighborhood centers, 
etc.) 

c. Agree a communications strategy within the stakeholder community and aggressively 
inform the residents of Flint of resources available and consequences of inaction. 

II. Create a short/medium and long term plan to capture roles and responsibilities at the local, 
county, state (and federal if appropriate) levels which will be reviewed and approved by the key 
stakeholder body. 

III. Be responsive to mayor, media, residents and all stakeholders about what currently is being 
done and how the way forward is being envisioned and agreed by stakeholder leadership. 

IV. Work to eliminate duplication of effort and ensure that members of the science community 
engaged in assessing and protecting the public health have unfettered access to data, reports, 
etc. and establish a mutually agreeable process to surface and resolve conflicting interpretations 
of data when it occurs. 

V. Coordinate with State departments (DHHS, DEQ, Executive Office) to secure funding needed and 
subject matter resources to ensure long term monitoring and remediation efforts. 

VI. Ensure that the recommendations of the After Action Task Force are executed. 

VII. Provide weekly status updates to Governor Snyder and members of his team charged with 
supporting the Chief Coordinator. 

VIII. Determine how what is being done in Flint is relevant to other communities and needs to be 
shared as part of a state wide strategy. This may also impact future policy development to 
address long term infrastructure remediation.

Addressing Flint’s Water Concerns 


Recent events have raised concerns among many as to the safety and quality of the water 
provided by the City's utility system. The City is and continues to be committed to assuring 
that residents and visitors know that the water is safe and that those responsible for 
providing water are working every day to improve the quality of the water. The quality of the 
water does need improvement, but that is not to be confused with safety of the water. The 
recent notice by MDEQ clearly stated that the water provided by the utility system is safe to 
drink, but cautioned that some vulnerable groups may want to consult with their health care 
provider if they have concerns. The City remains committed to their efforts to assure that the 
water is safe for everyone and that quality is improved. 


To date, the City has taken the following actions: 

• As an integral part of the transition to the Flint River on a temporary basis, the MDEQ 
was consulted about the City’s plans, and ultimately issued necessary permits to proceed. 
The City also engaged the services of the LAN engineering firm to guide the city in 
installing the necessary equipment to treat the water on an ongoing basis. This resulted in 
the development of a comprehensive drinking water plan. 

• The City monitors its water quality on a daily basis to assure that water quality remains 
within established guidelines. With the variances in water temperature and the leakage 
and infiltration problems arising as the result of failure of parts of the distribution system, 
water quality did exceed, for a time some of the established guidelines. This resulted in 
the issuance of the recent notices to the public. Upon receipt of information that some 
guidelines were exceeded, the City’s priority focus was to bring water quality back within 
guidelines. Efforts taken to address non-compliance included increasing water flow 
through valve replacements and hydrant flushing and optimizing treatment processes. 

• The City has committed to increasing communication with the public in order to inform 
water users factually of the issues which have arisen, to alleviate unnecessary concern, to 
identify the steps being taken to address the issues. This is being implemented through 
detailed and easy to understand educational materials being made available both online 
and at City Hall, as well as through ongoing public informational meetings. 

• Most recently, in light of recent concerns raised by resident groups over the quality and 
safety of water, Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft and his staff 
collected questions from citizens during a recent public meeting. After reviewing these 
questions, DPW Director Croft and his staff set out to answer them in concise detail; the 
result of that work is a full Water System Questions and Answers document which has 
been made available online. Along with the detailed information within, the document 
also contains links to other source documents and regulatory statutes found online which 
were used as reference. “We want the residents, businesses and visitors of Flint to know 
that the water in Flint is safe and that we are working every day to make improvements to 
our system to ensure that,” said Croft. “Our goal is make sure we get people the 



information on our efforts and assure them that we are on the right track with them.” 
More documentation, including regular water quality monitoring reports, will be made 
available as they become ready for distribution. 

• Additionally, a number of public meetings have and will continue to take place. Two of 
the most recent of these took place at the Antioch Baptist Church and the Mott 
Community College Regional Technology Center. These meetings were held by 
concerned neighborhood groups and were attended by Mayor Walling and DPW Director 
Croft. At both meetings, citizens voiced their concerns and asked questions about water 
quality and the recent violation notice. Director Croft offered detailed answers to 
common questions, but also offered to investigate specific water issues raised by 
residents in which the City could offer assistance. Those in attendance came away with a 
better understanding of the issues surrounding the drinking water in their community. 

• The City of Flint will be hosting a water presentation on Wednesday, January 21, 2015 at 
7pm. That presentation will held in the City Hall Dome and will feature information 
detailing water treatment, water distribution and the steps being taken to ensure that 
citizens get water that meets all regulatory' safety and quality standards. City DPW 
officials Howard Croft and Daugherty Johnson, Utilities Administrator, will be joined on 
a panel by representatives from the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office, the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and LAN engineering. Written questions 
from the audience will be collected during the presentation and answered by the panel 
after the presentation. 

• The City of Flint has also determined that in light of the serious concerns raised, it will 
secure the services of an external firm with expertise in managing drinking water quality 
to assess the steps that the city has taken, to make recommendations as to other steps to 
be taken, to oversee their implementation, and to monitor operations until the City’s 
water source becomes the KWA.. A Request for Proposal was issued on January 15, 
2015, with proposals due back on January 26. 


The DWSD Question: 

As a result of the concerns raised, several community members have suggested that the City 
reconnect to the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD). DWSD has advised that they 
would be willing to allow such a reconnection without a hook-up fee. However, the City would 
be obligated to pay a fixed monthly charge of $846,700 plus the $14.92/Mcf cost of water itself. 
The City’s analysis of the DWSD proposal concludes that the City’s cost would increase by 
more than $12 million per year at the proposed rates, and could increase even more as proposed 
rates are subject to change after July 1, 2015. This increase in costs would not be in the best 
interests of the City or its water users, as the City is committed to assuring safety and improving 
water quality by following its current plan, and reconnecting to DWSD would likely require 
deferment of existing capital improvements or an additional increase in rates. 



Talking Points: 


The City, in conjunction with the Dept, of Environmental Quality, is working diligently... every 
day...to ensure Flint residents have access to clean, safe water. To that end, the City has 
issued an RFP soliciting expert assistance to assure the City is doing everything it needs to be 
doing. 

The city continues to work closely with staff from the Department of Environmental Quality 
(DEQ) to ensure water meets safety guidelines, that water operations are managed properly, 
and all regulations are met. 

The city is committed to addressing the issue and continues to pursue its strategy. 


Background: 

On December 16, 2014, the City of Flint received a violation notice from the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), stating the City water samples were in violation of 
Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL), a violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act (PA 399 of 
1976). 

The DEQ considers the violation period to have begun December 1, 2014. The violation was 
triggered when water sample reports showed that the City's water quality, on average, exceed 
the total allowable level of Disinfection Byproducts during the first three quarters of 2014. 
Further, four of the City's eight water sample site locations individually exceeded allowable 
MCL levels during the same period of 2014. 

These conditions are considered a Tier 2 violation and, as a result, the City was required to 
notify the public of these contamination levels by January 10, 2015 (which was done) and 
continue to notify them every three months until the violation is resolved. 

The City outlined some potential remedies to the problem in its initial Operational Evaluation 
Report, dated November 26, 2014. These potential remedies are intended to be implemented 
in stages. Stage 1 consists of actions that can be implemented without any new construction 
within the distribution system and are due to be implemented by early March 2015. 

• Troubleshooting of the ozone system. 

• Implementation of different testing methods. 

• Operational changes at the WaterTreatment Plant. 

• Increase water main flushing efforts to minimize stagnant water. 

• Identify areas with high water age and implement preemptive measures. 


The City will be providing additional potential solutions when it updates the Operational 
Evaluation Report, which must be submitted to the DEQ by March 1, 2015. 



To date, the City has taken the following actions: 


As an integral part of the transition to the Flint River on a temporary basis, the MDEQ was 
consulted about the City's plans, and ultimately issued necessary permits to proceed. The 
City also engaged the services of the LAN engineering firm to guide the city in installing the 
necessary equipment to treat the water on an ongoing basis. This resulted in the development 
of a comprehensive drinking water plan. 

The City monitors its water quality on a daily basis to assure that water quality remains within 
established guidelines. With the variances in water temperature and the leakage and 
infiltration problems arising as the result of failure of parts of the distribution system, water 
quality did exceed, for a time, some of the established guidelines. This resulted in the issuance 
of the recent notices to the public. 

Efforts taken to address non-compliance included increasing water flow through valve 
replacements and hydrant flushing and optimizing treatment processes. 

The City has committed to increasing communication with the public in order to inform water 
users factually of the issues which have arisen, to alleviate unnecessary concern and to identify 
steps being taken to address the issues. This is being implemented through detailed 
educational materials being made available both online and at City Hall, as well as through

document is available online. 

Additional information: 


State and city officials have said exposure to TTHM is a long-term concern for some if they drink 
water with elevated TTHM for several decades . 

Notices indicated that Flint water is safe to drink but warns those with a "severely 
compromised immune systems or who are elderly" may be at increased risk and should seek 
advice about drinking water from your health care provider. 

The city and county are partners in the Karegnondi Water Authority, which is building a pipeline 
to Lake Huron to bring lake water here for use by the end of 2016. 

Returning to DWSD would add approximately $1 million (monthly) to the City expenses.

All, 


Mr. Earley asked me to share with you his response to the below media inquiry. It was as 
follows: 


"The decision to separate from DWSD and go with the Karegnondi Water Authority, including 
the decision to pump Flint river water in the interim, were both a part of a long-term plan that 
was approved by Flint's Mayor, and confirmed by a City Council vote of 7-1 in March of 2013 - a 
full seven months before I began my term as Emergency Manager. That vote was supported 
and signed into emergency order by then Emergency Manager Edward Kurtz on March 29, 

2013. It was my responsibility to implement the previously accepted and approved plan as the 
contract with DWSD expired in April 2014 during my term as EM. It did not fall to me to second 
guess or to invalidate the actions that were taken prior to my appointment. An even bigger 
concern that everyone should be focused on moving forward is what is done in the long-term to 
replace the crumbling water distribution system that exits throughout Flint and Genesee 
County." 

Please let him know if you have any questions. 

Thanks.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health , water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, 
environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and 
Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, 
public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the 


i 



state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the 
MEC for six years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan 
Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having 
joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public 
Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community 
Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served 
as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as 
Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the county’s 
bankruptcy and issuance of $1.7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of 
Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, 
wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Children’s Health 
Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice 
for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Flint Water Task Force discussion points 
Oct. 21, 2015 
High-level points 

■ The task force's mission is to provide an independent review of decisions and practices at the 
state, federal and city level concerning water in Flint. 

■ While members will review and report about what has transpired, the focus will be on 
improving practices moving forward. Members intend to develop recommendations for changes 
that can be applied in Flint and across Michigan. 

■ The task force will have full independence, and the administration has pledged full and 
complete cooperation. 

■ The goal is to have a completed report within three months, but the task force has the ability to 
extend that time frame if necessary. Members intend to conduct a thorough review, given the 
importance of its work. 

■ The task force will operate as transparently as possible, and there are expected to be 
opportunities for public input.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Comprehensive action plan 
will help Flint residents address water concerns 

Collaborative effort with state, federal and city leaders focuses on testing, assistance 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint residents need to have access to safe, clean, water now and long 
into the future, Gov. Rick Snyder said, announcing a comprehensive action plan created 
with state, federal and city leaders to address concerns about drinking water. 

The water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to drink, but some families with 
lead plumbing in their homes or service connections could experience higher levels of 
lead in the water that comes out of their faucets. 

The action plan focuses on increasing water testing, offering additional precautions for 
families with lead plumbing in their homes, and providing long-term solutions to address 
the city’s water infrastructure challenges. The plan was created at Snyder’s direction by 
the Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Health and Fluman 
Services (DHHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the city of Flint. 

“We are focused on helping ensure safe, clean, accessible drinking water and 
addressing and mitigating concerns and protecting public health,” Snyder said. “Today’s 
action plan builds upon ongoing work with local, state and federal agencies and our 
partnership with city and community leaders. Together, we are working to ensure that all 
Flint residents have accurate information and know that help is available to address 
potential problems.” 

The city and the state also are working together to gather more data to ensure the water 
that leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for 
all residents. The plan includes: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately to ensure that drinking water is safe, with testing 
also available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 


i 



• Offering free water testing to Flint residents to assure their drinking water is safe. 

• Providing free water filters to residents. 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes. 

• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines. 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee to ensure the best technology, 
practices and science are being followed by adding an expert from the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s Office of Research and Development to the group. 

• Naming Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health and 
Human Services, as the Flint drinking water public health adviser. 

• Boosting a comprehensive lead education program to make sure residents have detailed 
information about how to protect themselves and their homes. 


Residents can have their water tested by calling 810-787-6537 and pressing 1 , or 
emailing flintvvater@cifvofflinf.com . The DEQ is covering the cost of this testing. 

State leaders have been working closely with state and federal lawmakers to tap 
resources at all levels of government to address concerns. 

State health experts said there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead 
levels in some specific communities. Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood 
lead levels of children in Flint have followed an expected seasonal trend. While this 
analysis for Flint as a whole remains true, a comprehensive and detailed review 
breaking down data by ZIP codes with the city revealed that MDHFIS data is consistent 
with a study presented recently by Hurley Children’s Hospital. 

“While we cannot conclusively say that the water source change is the sole cause of the 
increase, this analysis supports our efforts as we take active steps to reduce all 
potential lead exposures in Flint,” MDHHS Director Nick Lyon said. “As part of this, we 
are working closely with our public and private partners to provide Flint residents on 
MDHHS assistance programs with free water filters and inform families about the steps 
they can take to reduce all lead exposures in their home.” 

As a part of the action plan, National Sanitation Foundation certified water filters will be 
made available to Flint residents through emergency state funds and coordinated efforts 
with local community agencies and donors. Information about how to obtain the filters 
will soon be available. 

“This action plan offers concrete steps we will take in a local, state and federal 
partnership to ensure all Flint residents have safe water to drink,” DEQ Director Dan

Wyant said. “The DEQ will work closely with the city to gather further data to ensure the 
water that leaves Flint’s system as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe to 
drink.”

Representative- 

We're setting up a meeting with you, Harvey Hollins, Nick Lyon and Dan Wyant as soon as possible to make sure you are 
in the same ioop on this as we are. The issues you raise in your letter are similar to the same ones we are raising 
internally ourselves. Lead is not an acceptable risk in any event, however lead content pipes are prevalent in older cities 
throughout Michigan and we’ll all have to pool our efforts to work with these pipes now and in the future. Although 
there are some legitimate questions relating to the conclusions reached by the Hurley folks, they are a city institution 
and we would have expected them to report and discuss those concerns with city leadership so that the city could act, 
but that is a different subject. 

Whenever you are available we'll do our best to schedule and come over and meet with you.

Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 

Dear Gov. Snyder, 

I'm writing to voice my displeasure with the lack of communication between your office and mine concerning the water 
crisis in the city of Flint. 

Since I have been in a position to represent my community at the Capitol, I have been in constant contact with your 
office to offer advice, help, partnership and solutions. My community elected me to represent them in Lansing, and I 
have been striving to do just that. Several letters have reached your office, and I have been highly vocal about the need 
to come together to fix the water crisis. This has been done with the understanding that we both care about the people 
of Flint, who I represent in the Legislature, and who you represent as governor of this state. 

I have also reached out to Dr. Eden Wells and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality to be proactive in addressing the issue of lead-laced water damaging the minds 
and bodies of Flint's citizens, especially the children. While this crisis could be solved by switching water sources, the 
problems will remain in the health of our future generation. 

I had hoped that this entire problem would have been addressed through partnership, teamwork and cooperation. It is 
unfortunate that hasn't been the case. It is also unfortunate that common courtesy to my office on being kept up to 
speed with any operational changes and financial solutions has not been timely communicated. 

I will continue to keep the lines of communication open as we address the continued problem of health in Flint, and I 
hope you will take the opportunity to join me in conversation to find future solutions.

Actually it seems like he threw you and me under the bus and frankly i didn't appreciate it. I'm pissed at Ananich also 
and think Phelps is a gadfly, but you and I didn't deserve this from Neely. The first time 1 heard from him was through 
you and he could have called like anyone else. You've been working with him since the beginning, and I know you've 
talked to him multiple times. He has no reason to throw you under the bus.

Chief-1 hear you, but I consider Phelps lawsuit and Ananich's rhetoric to be just as incendiary. Sheldon is frustrated. He 
reached out to DEQ early before all this broke and was blown off. He sent a letter to DHHS and got no response when 
he was told that they would get back with him by Tuesday this week. Ananich has met with the Governor, to my 
knowledge he hasn't on this issue. Ananich has had meetings the each of the Directors at issue a few times, he hasn't 
and his district is the city of Flint. While I do not like his approach with MSP on high speed chases, on this issue he has 
been more reasonable than most.

• Most elected officials are pointing fingers at the state,

weekend. 

• Mayor Walling and his challenger Weaver are debating tonight.

Governor Snyder, 

In the interest of being sensitive to the unforeseen problems that will affect children of this Flint Water Crisis, I am 
formally requesting you to forgive the debt balance currently imposed on the Flint Community Schools. I make this 
request because this school district will have the majority burden of addressing issues relating to the lead intrusion into 
the blood of children in this school system. There will be untold problems for years to come that will require an already 
overwhelmed school district to be required to meet the needs of these children who are victims of this disaster. 


Respectfully,

Cultural Change in State Government 
* We've come a long way already in reinventing 


state government 

♦ Thank you for your leadership - reinventing 
state government is not easy 

* Where have we been, where are we headed - 
that's what the rest of today is all about 


Governor's general welcome to group, a thanks for all the good work, set tone for the 
meeting (where we have been, where we are headed the next three years, what we will 
leave behind)

Remember where we have been 



Governor can remark about the original vision, how it doesn't go away and the 10 points 
remain, but it's time to build upon it, and that both John Bernard and Pat McDonnell are 
going to help us do that

Measures of Success

The Honorable Jim Ananich 
Senate Minority Leader 
State Capitol, Room S-105 
Lansing, Michigan 

Dear Senator Ananich: 

Enclosed are answers to the questions you posed in your October 20, 201 5 letter to our 
office regarding the audit we are conducting of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal 
Assistance (ODWMA), Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), specific to lead 
contamination in the City of Flint's drinking water. Also enclosed are additional questions 
we developed that are relevant to these issues, along with five exhibits: 

• A map showing Flint water samples by zip code. 

• A map showing lead counts of 5 parts per billion or higher. 

• Two charts showing the number of samples by time period and zip code. 

• A time line of the Flint water review. 

We appreciate the opportunity to assist you in answering questions regarding this topic. If 
you have further questions or a request for other services, please do not hesitate to 
contact our office. 


Sincerely, 



Doug Ringler 
Auditor General 


Enclosures 



Q1 : How does ODWMA ensure the data it receives is accurate? 

A: With regard to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lead 
and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring requirements, DEQ relies on the following key 
controls to ensure the accuracy of test results: 

• State-owned laboratories test water samples. 

• State-owned laboratories send test results directly to DEQ. 

• The City of Flint Water Treatment Plant (Flint WTP) certifies whether 

sample sites are classified as tier 1*. 

The current Flint WTP LCR sampling process includes: 

1 . DEQ informs the Flint WTP of the required water lead and copper 
sample size. 

2. The Flint WTP determines the pool of tier 1 sites for sampling. 

3. The Flint WTP selects the sample. 

4. The Flint WTP sends out sample kits and instructions to residents for 
collecting water samples. 

5. Residents leave samples and signed sampling forms outside their front 
doors. 

6. The Flint WTP employee picks up samples and forms from residents. 

7. The Flint WTP employee reviews sample forms for completeness. 

8. The Flint WTP employee sends samples to the State-owned 
laboratories. 

9. State-owned laboratories test samples and provide results directly to 
DEQ. 

10. DEQ receives water lead and copper sample results, which include 
the following information: date collected, date received, address 
where collected, type of residence (e.g., single family or apartment), 
and sample point (e.g., kitchen sink or bathroom sink). 

1 1 . DEQ tracks, and follows up if necessary, the number of samples 
collected by the Flint WTP to help ensure that the required minimum 
number of samples are collected by the monitoring period deadline. 


Single-family or multiple-family residence with lead service line, lead solder copper piping 
constructed after 1982, or lead plumbing. 


Page 1 


1 2. The Flint WTP submits lead and copper report to DEQ that certifies 
whether sample sites meet tier 1 criteria. 

13. DEQ prepares the LCR 90th percentile calculation report. 

During our review, we noted two potential improvements for the Flint WTP 
sampling process (see Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the 
OAG regarding tier 1 sample validity): 

• DEQ could verify that the sampling pool was limited to only tier 1 sample 
sites to ensure that the Flint WTP is in compliance with the LCR 

(Title 40, Part 141, section 86(a)(3) of the Code of Federal Regulations 
[ CFR ]). 

• DEQ could independently verify the validity of sample site certifications. 


Q2: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who fail to follow data 

verification protocols? 

A: DEQ does not provide any direct oversight over the Flint WTP and, therefore, 
does not have any accountability measures over the Flint WTP's LCR data 
verification protocols. DEQ's data verification protocol for lead and copper 
water sampling is limited to verification that the WTP certifies samples 
submitted to the State-owned laboratories for analysis (see steps 7 and 1 2 in 
the Flint WTP LCR sampling process noted in Question 1 above). We did not 
identify any instances in which ODWMA staff failed to verify that submitted 
samples were certified by the Flint WTP. 


Q3: What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who lie or 

misrepresent information to the EPA? 

A: As with all classified employees, ODWMA staff must adhere to the rules and 
regulations established by the Michigan Civil Service Commission. If any 
ODWMA staff were determined to misrepresent information to the EPA, they 
would be subject to Civil Service Rule 2-6, Discipline, which allows an 
appointing authority to discipline an employee for just cause up to and including 
dismissal. We are not aware of any DEQ-established measures that are in 
addition to the Civil Service Rules. 

We gained access to the e-mail accounts of key DEQ management (DEQ 
Director, Deputy Director, ODWMA Chief, and other key ODWMA staff) 
extending back to January 1 , 2013. We did so to identify the key decision 
points and conversations that occurred leading up to and through the situation in 
Flint. Our review was also intended to determine whether State, Flint, or other 
officials attempted to conceal key test results or other information. 

We noted one e-mail exchange between DEQ and the EPA that appears to be a 
significant contributor to the concern that DEQ misrepresented information to 
the EPA. The EPA requested clarification on February 26, 2015 regarding the 
type of optimized corrosion control treatment the Flint WTP was using. DEQ 
responded on February 27, 2015 that the city had an optimized corrosion 
control program in place, but DEQ did not provide any program details. DEQ 
informed us that the Flint WTP corrosion control program included performing 


Page 2 



lead and copper monitoring for two consecutive six-month periods to determine 
whether corrosion control treatment would be necessary in the future. 

However, it appears the EPA interpreted corrosion control program to mean that 
corrosion control treatment was being performed. 

On April 23, 201 5, the EPA again inquired as to what the Flint WTP was doing 
for corrosion control treatment. DEQ responded on April 24, 2015 that the Flint 
WTP was not practicing corrosion control treatment. 

Based on our review of this and other e-mails, we have no specific reason to 
believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented the information to the EPA. 


Q4: What policies do DEQ and ODWMA have in place to escalate major infractions up 

the chain of command? 

A: We did not note any instances of major infractions (i.e., intentional disregard of 
policies, laws, regulations or specific directions) committed by DEQ staff during 
the course of our review. DEQ does not have a formal policy or procedure in 
place to escalate major infractions performed by ODWMA employees; however, 
our review of DEQ correspondence confirmed the escalation of key issues up the 
chain of command related to the Flint situation. DEQ stated that its informal 
policy is for staff to notify the proper level of management of infractions to 
determine necessary action. 


Page 3 




Application of the LCR 

Q1 : How did the Flint WTP become the primary water supplier for the City of Flint? 

A: Upon notification of the City of Flint's plans to switch to the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) in April 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department 
(DWSD) submitted a letter to the City of Flint stating that it would terminate its 
agreement to provide water services on April 17, 2014. 

According to DEQ management, the Flint WTP attempted to negotiate with the 
DWSD to maintain it as the City of Flint water supplier; however, after 
negotiations were unsuccessful, the City of Flint notified DEQ through a permit 
request of its intent to operate the Flint WTP full time using the Flint River. 
Although the Flint City Council voted in March 2013 in support of moving to the 
KWA pipeline, the vote was silent on the use of the Flint River as a temporary 
drinking water source. 

DEQ informed us that in the 1990s, the City of Flint upgraded the Flint WTP to 
serve as a backup source of water for emergencies. In 2006, the Flint WTP 
began quarterly testing of the treated Flint River water at the Flint WTP to 
ensure water quality standards were met; however, the Flint WTP did not test 
the water's effect on the distribution system at consumer tap locations. 


Q2. Did DEQ consult with the EPA prior to determining how to apply the LCR? 

A: DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how to apply the LCR prior to 

implementing two consecutive six-month monitoring periods of the Flint WTP 
beginning July 1, 2014. Based on past experiences applying the LCR monitoring 
requirements, DEQ believed that it had appropriately applied the LCR 
requirements of a large water system. 


Q3: When Flint switched to the Flint River water source, should corrosion control 

treatment have been maintained? 

A: We believe that corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 

According to the LCR, a water system can achieve optimized corrosion control if 
it submits results of tap water monitoring for two consecutive six-month 
monitoring periods with acceptable lead levels. However, a water system that 
has optimized corrosion control, and which has treatment in place, should 
continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment. 

DEQ staff explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a 
new system, but as a new source. DEQ further stated that because the Flint 
River was a new water source and there was a change in chemicals needed to 
treat the new source, a corrosion control study was needed to determine the 
impact on the water distribution system. Therefore, it was DEQ's interpretation 
that two rounds of six-month monitoring were still needed to evaluate the water 
quality and determine optimal corrosion control treatment. 


Page 4 


The Flint water system had optimal corrosion control treatment when the DWSD 
WTP was the water supplier. Based on our review of notes from a July 21 , 
2015 EPA and DEQ conference call on DEQ's implementation of the LCR 
regarding whether the Flint WTP should have continued to maintain corrosion 
control treatment, it appeared that the EPA did not agree with DEQ's 
interpretation of the LCR. Region 5 EPA staff explained that they would talk to 
the EPA headquarters about the interpretation of regulations and believes that 
systems that have been deemed optimized need to "maintain" corrosion control. 
The Region agreed to provide supporting regulatory citations for the language 
about maintaining corrosion control. 

On November 3, 2015, the EPA issued a memorandum stating that the LCR had 
differing possible interpretations; however, the EPA concluded that it is 
important for large water systems to take the steps necessary to ensure that 
appropriate corrosion control treatment is maintained at all times, thus ensuring 
that public health is protected. Based on this clarification, it appears that 
corrosion control treatment should have been maintained. 


Q4: Should DEQ have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized corrosion 

control treatment after the first round of six-month sampling results were above the 
lead action level of 5 parts per billion (ppb)? 

A: Yes. According to DEQ's application of the LCR, within six months after the 
end of the monitoring period in which the water sample results exceeded the 
acceptable lead level, DEQ should have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing 
optimized corrosion control treatment. 

The LCR states that the lead action level is exceeded if the lead level, as 
determined by the 90th percentile calculation, is greater than 15 ppb. If the 
lead action level is exceeded, water systems are required to take additional 
actions including educating the public about lead in drinking water as well as 
commencing lead service line replacement if the water system has already 
installed corrosion control and/or source water treatment. However, for water 
systems that have not yet implemented corrosion control treatment, they can be 
deemed to have optimized corrosion control without installing treatment if they 
can demonstrate lead levels below 5 ppb for two consecutive six-month periods. 

The first round of six-month sampling results was received in late March 2015. 
Because the results were 1 ppb over the lead action level of 5 ppb, DEQ would 
not be able to achieve two consecutive six-month periods below 5 ppb. 
Therefore, DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized 
corrosion control treatment. However, DEQ waited until the second round of 
sampling was completed (June 30, 2015) to assess whether water sample 
results improved. 


Water Samples 

Q5: Did DEQ verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected by the Flint WTP in the 

two rounds of six-month samples? 

A: DEQ did not verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected. DEQ relies on 
the Flint WTP's certification of sample sites and does not perform any 
independent verification of those certifications. 


Page 5 



In a November 19, 2015 Flint Journal article, the Flint WTP indicated that it did 
not have the ability to ensure that all sites were tier 1 . In fact, water samples 
came from the random distribution of 175 testing bottles without regard for 
whether the homes were at risk for high lead levels. DEQ issued a formal 
memorandum on November 9, 201 5 requesting that the Flint WTP verify the 
classification of all prior sample items. The results are due back from the Flint 
WTP on December 30, 201 5. 


Q6: DEQ dropped two water sampling sites from its second six-month sample 

(January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015). Was this appropriate? 

A: Yes, it was appropriate for DEQ to drop these two water sampling sites. Federal 
regulation 40 CFR 141.86(a) states: 

"... each water system shall complete a materials evaluation 
of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted 
sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section . . . 

All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be 
selected from this pool . . . Sampling sites may not include 
faucets that have point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment 
devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants." 

This regulation also requires that a water system's targeted sampling pool 
consist of only tier 1 sampling sites if an adequate number is available to meet 
monitoring requirements. 

According to federal regulation 40 CFR 141.86(f), the State may invalidate a 
water sample if it determines that the sample was taken from a site that did not 
meet the site selection criteria. A sample invalidated per this regulation does 
not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels or toward 
meeting the minimum monitoring requirements. 

DEQ dropped one water sample site from its 90th percentile calculations 
because the site was from a business that does not meet the tier 1 requirements 
of being a single-family or multiple-family residence. The second sample site 
was dropped because the home had a point-of-entry treatment device to filter 
contaminants. Based on the criteria specified above, it appears that DEQ's 
rationale for dropping the samples from these two sites appropriately met the 
requirements for invalidating samples per federal regulation 40 CFR 141.86. 


Q7: Was flushing of the taps the night before drawing a sample an appropriate sample 

methodology? 

A: Yes. The LCR requires that samples be a first draw of water after six hours of 
stagnation. The LCR does not indicate whether or not the water line should be 
flushed prior to collecting the sample. In the sample instructions, DEQ required 
preflushing to ensure that sampled faucets were not stagnant for an excessive 
period of time beyond the targeted six hours (e.g., rarely used faucets or when a 
homeowner has been gone for an extended period of time.) 

The LCR requires six hours of stagnation; however, it does not preclude DEQ 
from instructing residents to flush prior to stagnation. 


Page 6 




In calendar year 1992, the Flint WTP established a tier 1 sample site pool for LCR 
monitoring. With the change to the Flint River water, the Flint WTP needed to increase the 
pool of sample locations because of additional sampling requirements. The following 
exhibit documents the 2014 and 2015 sample locations for LCR monitoring. Based on the 
data obtained during our review, we could not determine how the locations were selected 
or whether they were properly classified as tier 1 sample sites. 

As noted in Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the OAG, DEQ has 
requested the Flint WTP to verify the tier 1 classification of all prior sample items.

This chart expands on Exhibit #1 to show a summary by zip code and time of selection 
within the sampling period. Based on the data obtained during our review, we could not 
determine if the lateness of selection within the monitoring period affected the 
appropriateness of the sample items.

Frank: Just wanted to circle back on the action taken by the Home Depot Team. Our team connected with 
Richard Baird and received direction on the greatest need. As a result, we took the following action; 

1. Donated 10 pallets of water for the Flint schools 

2. Donated 8 pallets for the police and fire departments (we believe they will distribute to families) 

3. We facilitated the purchase of water filters by the Red Cross ($80,000) with our supplier 

In addition we are lowering our pricing on water and filters in the market to assist customers with 
purchase. Our district manager also conducted a training session on how to install/use the filters which will be

Frank: 


We have a situation in Flint, Michigan that is beginning to get national attention and could be an opportunity for 
Home Depot. 18 months ago, Flint switched its water supply from Detroit Water (the distance and pumping 
costs of going uphill made it quite expensive) to the Flint River as a temporary answer, until they could finish 
the construction to get their water from Lake Huron (Karagondi Water System). The corrosive attributes of the 
River water have exacerbated the lead deposit leaching into homeowner pipes and there is concern around lead 
poisoning, especially for infants. 

The corporate community is rallying to address the problem. Meijer donated 1500 water filters to low income 
residents and GM is about to announce a donation of between 5,000 and 10,000 filters. I do not yet know where 
GM is getting the filters from, but I was thinking that Home Depot might want to join the effort with a donation, 
supply chain discounting assistance, or some combination of activity that could help Flint residents. Harvey 
Hollins is our point person for this effort, since he is the Director of Urban Initiatives for Governor Snyder. I 
have copied him here. 

If you could get this into the hands of the right people and see if there is interest in speaking with Harvey, I

prepared by DEQ and DF1HS. These were intended for internal use, so please ask our partners to not share them 
beyond the people on their teams making the decisions.

Mr. Earley asked me to share with you his response to the below media 
inquiry. It was as follows: 


"The decision to separate from DWSD and go with the Karegnondi Water 
Authority, including the decision to pump Flint river water in the interim, were 
both a part of a long-term plan that was approved by Flint's Mayor, and 
confirmed by a City Council vote of 7-1 in March of 2013 - a full seven months 
before I began my term as Emergency Manager. That vote was supported and 
signed into emergency order by then Emergency Manager Edward Kurtz on 
March 29, 2013. It was my responsibility to implement the previously accepted 
and approved plan as the contract with DWSD expired in April 2014 during my 
term as EM. It did not fall to me to second guess or to invalidate the actions that 
were taken prior to my appointment. An even bigger concern that everyone 
should be focused on moving forward is what is done in the long-term to replace 
the crumbling water distribution system that exits throughout Flint and Genesee 
County." 

Please let him know if you have any questions. 

Thanks. 

Michelle Z.

Mr. Croft and Mr. Kurtz, 

Attached is the back-up data that we believe is responsive to your request below. Please keep in mind that the 
information provided was developed in order to provide Flint with an "apples to apples" comparison of rates 
between the DWSD and KWA scenarios based upon current rate assumptions under the contract in place 
through April 2014. 

As always, please feel free to call with any questions.

Good Afternoon Ms. McCormick, 


We appreciate your response to our additional questions, Mr. Kurtz 
would like to know if you could provide a quick summary to the 
following inquiry. 

On page two, in paragraph one, it is stated that "the total Water 
Utility Costs through 2042 are only $3,215.04 million, or $908.85 
million less than the KWA scenario." 

We are curious what formula DWSD used to calculate the $908.85 
million dollars less than KWA? 


l 



We are meeting this afternoon to review your responses and any 
additional information on this issue would be greatly appreciated. 


Thank you.

DWSD / KWA Executive Summary Outline 


Premise and Approach 

• Review most recent audited financial statements to establish baseline water revenues 
from Flint and Genesee County (GCDC), and how such revenues are applied. 

• Estimate how baseline will be impacted under two scenarios 

o Continued purchase of treated water from DWSD 

o Construction of new KWA raw water supply system and treated water supply 
system for Genesee County and construction of modifications to Flint Water 
Treatment Plant 

• Compare estimated short, mid, and long term financial projections for each scenario 
Assumptions - common to both scenarios 

• Current application of revenues is most accurately depicted by published audited 
financial statements for most recently fiscal years 

o FY ended December 31, 201 1 for Genesee County Drain Commission (GCDC) 
o FY ended June 30, 2012 for City of Flint 

• Most recently audited figures for Flint / Genesse County operating expenses, capital 
expenses, etc. are representative - inflate at 4.51%, consistent with TYJT report 

Assumptions - DWSD Scenario 

• DWSD water rate schedule 

o DWSD rate structure to Flint / Genesee County is amended to reflect 4/24/2013 
DWSD proposal, adjusted to reflect immediate reservation of 60 mgd capacity 
o DWSD rate escalation (for commodity and standby elements) at 4.7%, consistent 
with TYJT Report 

Assumptions - KWA Scenario 

• KWA scenario begins in FY 2017, at which time purchased water from DWSD would 
cease 

• Other than normal rate adjustments DWSD does not amend rate stmcture to Flint / 
GCDC 

• KWA scenario costs 

o KWA Raw Water Pipeline and Appurtenances Construction = $357.58 million, 
consistent with TYJT report 

o Flint Water Treatment Plant Construction Improvements = $7.1 million, 
consistent with TYJT report 

o GCDC Water Treatment Plant Construction Improvements = $110 million, 
consistent with 2009 KWA Preliminary Engineering Report 
o All construction costs are financed in terms set forth in the TYJT Report 

■ 3 years of capitalized interest 

■ Fully funded bond reserve account 

■ Bond issuance expenses at 2.25% 

o In addition, revenues are assumed to need to generate 1.20x coverage of annual 
debt service 

o Flint Water Treatment Plant Operating costs = $8.27 million starting in 2017, 
consistent with TYJT report 

o GCDC Water Treatment Plant Operating costs = $1.82 million starting in 2017, 
consistent with unit costs from the 2009 KWA Preliminary Engineering Report

Mr. Earley asked me to share with you his response to the below media inquiry. It was as 
follows: 


"The decision to separate from DWSD and go with the Karegnondi Water Authority, including 
the decision to pump Flint river water in the interim, were both a part of a long-term plan that 
was approved by Flint's Mayor, and confirmed by a City Council vote of 7-1 in March of 2013 - a 
full seven months before I began my term as Emergency Manager. That vote was supported 
and signed into emergency order by then Emergency Manager Edward Kurtz on March 29, 

2013. It was my responsibility to implement the previously accepted and approved plan as the 
contract with DWSD expired in April 2014 during my term as EM. It did not fall to me to second 
guess or to invalidate the actions that were taken prior to my appointment. An even bigger 
concern that everyone should be focused on moving forward is what is done in the long-term to 
replace the crumbling water distribution system that exits throughout Flint and Genesee

DEQ Director Dan Wyant today made the following statement as he 
announced DEQ Chief Deputy Jim Sygo will immediately assume the 
role of interim chief of the department's Office of Drinking Water and 
Municipal Assistance: 


1 



"It recently has become clear that our drinking water program staff made a 
mistake while working with the City of Flint. Simply stated, staff employed 
a federal protocol they believed was appropriate, and it was not. The 
water testing steps followed would have been correct for a city less than 
50,000 people, but not for a city of nearly 100,000. 

As details of the situation emerge, I am convinced our program staff 
believed they were doing their job right. As the state recognized there 
could be a health threat to Flint residents, we took appropriate steps. We 
are now embarked on an unprecedented effort to safeguard Flint residents 
and families with near-term, intermediate and long-term actions to protect 
and educate city residents. 

The issue in DEQ is experience and protocol with respect to corrosion 
control. The Governor has called for an independent, third-party after- 
action review. I have taken the step of changing leadership in the division. 
We are working with our federal partners and committed to being part of 
the U.S. EPA's effort to strengthen its Lead and Copper rule. 

All who brought this issue to the department deserve credit for bringing it 
forward. Lead is a serious issue, particularly for young people, and we 
take it seriously. The Governor's plan incorporates the suggestions 
outlined by the EPA and researchers at Virginia Tech. 

We will learn from this. We will make necessary changes to see to it that 
our program becomes a national leader in public health protection.” 

KEY MESSAGES: 


1 . It is increasingly clear through internal review at DEQ that staff 
overseeing drinking water mistakenly applied the wrong federal protocol 
when the city of Flint switched to the Flint River. 

2. Today's announcement of new leadership in that division aligns with the 
states goal: make sure the public health is protected in Flint and 
elsewhere in the state, and ensure we learn from this so it never happens 
again. 

3. The governor's action plan continues to protect kids and families in 
Flint, with the switch back to Detroit water last week, free water filtration 
for all city residents, and inspection of all Flint schools for lead exposure. 

4. Flint families who are concerned are encouraged to take advantage of 
free home water testing through the city and blood lead level testing for 
children.

Dear Governor, 

I am renewing my call for additional funding to address Flint's water challenges. While significant progress has 
been made, with the fiscal stress and pending lawsuits against the City, there is a gap in the funds necessary to 
meet the adopted capital improvement plan and to respond to new needs with lead pipes. Attached is a letter of 
request. I thank you in advance for your willingness to review. 

Sincerely,

REi Call for Additional Support for Flint Water Improvement Flan 
Dear Governor Snyder. 

On behalf of the Flint community, I am writing with a renewed request; for additional support to 
address Flint’s Water challenges to ensure that water is affordable and secure for everyone in Flint 
especially our vxthterable populations . I ain asking for tm additional $30 million in fluids, for . Flint’s 
infrastructure and a new healthy homes imitative , 

Significant progress lias been made throughout this year to increase water safety and quality and l. 
thank you for the involvement of your office, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 
and the Michigan Department of Treasury. A majority of items in the Water Improvement Plan 
me completed or undonyay. Most importantly i. Flint is now? in compliance with the Safe Prinking 
Water Act due in large part to the installation of the new carbon filter. The infrastructure sy stems 
are being made more secure and efficient through the State grants. Now the C-ify is committed to 
following. the recommendation of the Michigan Department of Environmental .Qualify to optimise 
the treatment process, reduce corrosion and ferthef mlnintese risks from load. 

The need to accelerate the City’s capital improvement investments remains and bos been further 
increased by the continued financial stress and legal issues. Previously I requested support for 
replacement or forgiveness of payment to the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund due to Flint’s 
status as a distressed community and the gap in funding in the adopted capital improvement: plan, 
I understand that the existing federal law does not allow the Bsiakiag 'Watef 1 Revolving 

Loans that Flint is carrying, to "be forgiven in retrospect but the need still exists. Flint owes 
approximately $2fi Million. One sol ution is for the State to grant a new $20 Million that is designed 
as forgivable from the state. Another solution is to proMde

Di stressed Cities, V i I lages and T ownships with a s upplemental budget amendment in cooperation 
with tire State Legislature. 

The eommmiity’s heightened concern, about lead leeching into the waterfront old service lines and 
home, plumbing also needs to be addressed. We know that lead is an environmental coBtmniimnt 
•and there have been many programs In place over: the years to address sources in paint and pipes. 
Flint needs a newt healthy homes Initiative speeifieally focused: on lead in water with $10 Million, 
to start the process of replacing service lines for the most vulnerable households. Regardless of the 
source and treatment of Flint’ $ water, this long term threat of lead in pipes needs to be removed in 
the interest of public health. 

My approach continues to he ro work with, you and your appointed officials. State Senator Ananich, 
State: Representatives Phelps and Neeley, Congressman Krldee, community groups, businesses, 
churches, foundations, the Flint City Council, and ail of the City of Flint and State and Federal 
government personnel. We need every available expert and resource to address Flint’s water 
problems, 

Flint’s safety is my top priority. Just as the City and State have worked together on public safety, 
we need additional support for fixing die water problems. We need S3 0 Million in new? funds to 
repair and update the city-wide mfrasimeture and to assist: ho usdiolds in becoming lead-free. The 
entire Flint community deserves sustainable, safe, secure and affordable water now and into tire 
future. Thank you for the consideration Governor and I look forward to Mure discussions.

Re: Teamwork and cooperation 


Chief— I hear you, but I consider Phelps lawsuit and Ananich's rhetoric to be just as incendiary. Sheldon is frustrated. He 
reached out to DEQ early before all this broke and was blown off. He sent a letter to DHHS and got no response when 
he was told that they would get back with him by Tuesday this week. Ananich has met with the Governor, to my 
knowledge he hasn't on this issue. Ananich has had meetings the each of the Directors at issue a few times, he hasn't 
and his district is the city of Flint. While I do not like his approach with MSP on high speed chases, on this issue he has 
been more reasonable than most.

Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 

Dear Gov. Snyder, 

I'm writing to voice my displeasure with the lack of communication between your office and mine 
concerning the water crisis in the city of Flint. 

Since I have been in a position to represent my community at the Capitol, I have been in constant 
contact with your office to offer advice, help, partnership and solutions. My community elected me to 
represent them in Lansing, and I have been striving to do just that. Several letters have reached your 
office, and I have been highly vocal about the need to come together to fix the water crisis. This has 
been done with the understanding that we both care about the people of Flint, who I represent in the 
Legislature, and who you represent as governor of this state. 

I have also reached out to Dr. Eden Wells and the Department of Health and Human Services and the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to be proactive in addressing the issue of lead-laced 
water damaging the minds and bodies of Flint's citizens, especially the children. While this crisis could be 
solved by switching water sources, the problems will remain in the health of our future generation. 

I had hoped that this entire problem would have been addressed through partnership, teamwork and 
cooperation. It is unfortunate that hasn't been the case. It is also unfortunate that common courtesy to 
my office on being kept up to speed with any operational changes and financial solutions has not been 
timely communicated. 


l 


I will continue to keep the lines of communication open as we address the continued problem of health 
in Flint, and I hope you will take the opportunity to join me in conversation to find future solutions. 


For the Love of the Community, 

Sheldon A. Neeley, State Representative

The Michigan Legislative Black Caucus (MLBC) voted Tuesday to 
ask that you eliminate the Regional Transition Advisory Board 
(RTAB) that oversees the city of Flint's finances and operations, 
and prevents the elected city government from exercising local 
control. 


The RTAB's continued existence denies Flint residents and their 
duly elected representatives the local control needed to establish 
and enforce good public policy, and continue to manage the city's 
finances in a responsible manner. The democratic process is 
suppressed when elected officials have to constantly seek state 
approval to implement the programs and policies requested by 
the constituents. 


We recognize that the RTAB serves at your pleasure. 
Unfortunately, we do not see an end in sight. 


Consequently, we are asking that you issue an Order that 
eliminates the RTAB within the next six months, and allow for an 
orderly transition of authority back to the locally elected city 
officials. 


Sincerely, 

Rep. Sheldon A, Neeley

Additional Steps for Flint 


Governor Snyder, 

In the interest of being sensitive to the unforeseen problems that will affect children of this Flint Water Crisis, I am 
formally requesting you to forgive the debt balance currently imposed on the Flint Community Schools. I make this 
request because this school district will have the majority burden of addressing issues relating to the lead intrusion into 
the blood of children in this school system. There will be untold problems for years to come that will require an already 
overwhelmed school district to be required to meet the needs of these children who are victims of this disaster. 


Respectfully, 

Sheldon Neeley

Flint Water Followups Early Next Week 


Dear Governor, 

Thank you for your continued efforts to address the problems with Flint's water and systems. The situation is 
taking on greater and greater urgency even as we work to respond. I appreciate your willingness to keep all 
options on the table including Flint returning to Detroit water. I believe this is a necessary step given all of the 
complications of this past year and what we are still facing. 

I spoke with Chief of Staff Muchmore yesterday afternoon. I am requesting that you work with the State 
Legislature to identify the new funds and financing mechanism that are needed for the switch. That is one 
essential aspect and we are working on the others and appreciate your team's support on those as well. I would 
ask for a time for us to talk about this early next week as we are also hoping to meet with DWSD in that 
timeframe. 

Thank you again for the focus and initiatives being put forward today. 

Sincerely, 

Mayor Walling

Flint Water Improvement Rian 

Dear Governor Snyder: 

On behalf of the Flint community, i am writing to convey serious concerns about water quality and to 
request your support for my proposed FlintWaterimprovement Plan. Access to sate and ciesn water is 
a baste human right, and, therefore, policy and budget decisions need to ensure that water is affordable 
and secure for everyone in Flint: and all across Michigan ft is essential there Is City, State 3nd Federal 
cooperation to address the challenges here and to meet the needs of vulnerable populations. 

Thefliht Water Improvement Wan fs : focused in fve areas: safety, quality, access, invest mentand : 
education. The plan puts safety and quality first because this is fundamental. It is designed to be a 
sustainable solution for the City of flint and the community as we move towards a new permanent 
water suppiy from take Huron through the haregnondi Water 1 Authority. My plan offers new ideas and 
also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs at the State and Federal 
levels. 

Safety & Quality 

* i£X)% Safety is the standard 

* City of Flint reports testing data to the public re assure safety and expands testing sites and 
frequency 

* Ssing on experiertced river water treatment operational management irrthe: Cityof Flint 
Access 

* Announce an amnesty program for Flint water service turn-ons and reduce the turn-on fee 

* Develop a revised affordable payment plan policy to encourage customers to return 

* Design Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance 
Fund for the elderly and ; vulnerable families 

Investment 

« Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital Improvement Plan 
through Federal and State investments

a Federal and State grants for infrastructure improvements in alignment with the Flint 
Master Plan 

* City Water Department implements budgeted FY1S projects inci udlng leak detection, valve 
repairs, new pipes and meter replacements 

Education 

» Develop a community partnership with universities to provide household and business 
customers with information on testing and conservation 

* Ongoirsg partnership with Michigan Department of Human Services, United Way, Salvation Army 
and community organizations to provide Information and water assistance with the Keep the 
Water Flowing Fund and support services 

® Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with consenratfarr and efficiency' (piloted in 
summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

If is also critical to restore the public confidence in Flint Water, The smpiementat Ion of this pi an m ust be 
accompanied by: extensive community engagement including local elected officials. My objective is to 
work with you and your appointed officials. State Senator Ananich, State Representatives Phelps and 
Neeley, Congressman Ktidee, communitygrou ps, businesses, churches, found3t!ons, the Flint City 
Council, and ail of the City of Flint and government personnel. 

it is imperative that we communicate better and provide residents more information. I understand 
representatives from the M ichigan Depa rtment of Environme ntai Quality will be joining a public fo rum 
this week at City Hall. This engagement going forward is vital so thank you for supporting their efforts. I 
think thts issue of transparency is important for comrmjnfties alt across the State, i recommend a review 
of the appiicabie laws and policies and, at a minimum, a new requirement that water testing data he 
reported publicly no less than quarterly by law in all Michigan communities in FliMks population 
category. 

Thank you for the consideration Governor. Thereis nothing more important ih Flint rightnow than fixing 
the water problems. We must work together to identify funds to repair and update the water treatment 
facilities and city-wide i nfrastructure and to help those persons without access to dean waterso that 
the entire Flint community has sustainable, safe, secure and affordable water now and into the future. 
This is an important Issue for the state of our State of Michigan and purge you to work with us to 
implement solutions.

Larry Reynolds posted a new message: 


Friday, Sept 11. Dr. Mona Flanna -Attisha contacted Dr. Lawrence Reynolds 
with concerns about children’s blood levels in light of Mark Edwards, 

PhD findings. Dr. Mona convened the Hurley Medical Center Research Team. 
Dr. Reynolds contacted the MDCFI Childhood Lead Prevention Program by 
phone and left data request for Flint EBLLs. Dr. Reynolds also 
contacted MDEQ staffer who stated MDEQ was waiting for a letter from 
MDCH .REGARDING HEALTH ISSUES AND ACTION. 


Wednesday .September 15-DHHS graph for 0-16 yoa children with Flint 
mailing addresses and ELLs to Dr. Reynolds was discussed with two GCHD 
Board of Health (GCBOH )members (chair Kay Doer and member Dr. Laura 
Carravallah )and management staff Maj^V«lasak---Dirss?tsf--;-©rv--G«ry 
J o h n so n Medical Director , and John Henry - Environmental Hygiene- in 
an informal meeting. The GCBOH chair read the mission of the GCHD aloud. 

GCHD Director’s response was that staff and resources to access MCIR 
data registry for lead levels were not available. A new software had 
been installed and the PDF format required manual extraction for a 
report to get ELLs .ages, and addresses. Also, he said it was the City 
of Flint Department of Public Works’s responsibility to issue a health 
advisory , not the GCHD. 


Monday .September 21- Greater Flint Health Coalition VIEWED 
PRESENTATION BY Dr. Mona H-A and passed a resolution to requesting a 
health advisory for the city of Flint. At noon , members of the GFHC 
met with the mayor-Walling , administrator-Henderson , and the DPW 
director-Crump , requesting action on the resolutions , the HMC research 
, and the Virginia Tech research. The response by the administrator was 


l 




Flint could not change water sources because of cost .Also, the water 
leaving the plant meets MDEQ standards 


Tuesday .September 22- Genesee County Medical Society (GCMS ) passed a 
resolution for the same. 

Thursday , September 24-In the absence of a response by the City 
Administration or the Genesee County Health Department, a press 
conference was called by HMC and GFHC members to advise the community 
of a health emergency with a presentation of the HMC research by Dr. 

Mona H-A , followed by remarks by the GCHD Director , Mark Valacak. The 

city administrator attended. The state continued to dispute the 

findings.

RE: Don Cummings Meeting 


FYI - Nick has an opportunity to speak at the GR Chamber at 1:30 that day, so Maureen asked if 11:30 - 12:30 would be 
OK. You have Flint Water Task Force until 11:30, so I told her you may be a little late.

Rich, 

We are looking at 12/02 for a lunch meeting, noon - 1 PM, in Lansing. Do you have a restaurant preference? Nick's 
Admin suggested Clara's possibly, farther from downtown. I know you like Troppo's.

Conference Call With Governor 


All: 

As you know, we have a conference call with the Governor at 4:30pm today... 

In a phone conversation with Rich Baird earlier today, he mentioned that he has heard the Task Force has 4 
initial items of concern: 

1. The lack of unfettered access to individuals with whom we need to meet. 

2. The lack of one individual or entity who has the responsibility to coordinate and marshal resources to respond 
to the ongoing situation in Flint. 

3. The proposed letter requesting the deployment of the resources of the Office of Emergency Preparedness and 
Response for additional testing of blood lead levels in Flint children. 

4. The apparent culture of "technical compliance" as a regulatory approach in the Safe Drinking Water Division 
at DEQ. 

Given the limited time we have with the Governor, I suggest we focus on the first 3 and leave the last one for 
another day. Although my take-away from our meeting with the DEQ is consistent with #4 above, I would 
characterize it as an initial impression and one that needs to be explored a bit further. 

Everyone should feel free to weigh in where they want, but Eric, I hope you will emphasize #1, Matt #3, and 
Chris— you or I— #2. 

Just my suggestion as a way to organize our conversation a bit... open to other thoughts as we proceed.

Dear Mayor Weaver and Administrator Henderson: 

As you are aware. Governor Snyder has appointed a Flint Water Advisory Task Force to review what 
led to the problem of high lead levels in drinking water, review the related regulatory framework, 
and make appropriate recommendations to prevent reoccurrence in Flint or elsewhere in Michigan. 
Members of the Task Force are Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, Dr. Matthew Davis, Eric Rothstein, Chris 
Koib, and Ken Sikkema. 

As part of our review, we would like to talk with appropriate individuals who are or were 
responsible for Flint Water Treatment Plant operations and capital planning during the past few 
years. We think these discussions are important for us to understand how the source water 
conversion was planned and implemented, how challenges in treating water from the Flint River 
were managed, and how water quality in the distribution system was monitored and addressed. 

individuals we would like to meet with include (1) Howard Croft, (2) DPW Staff - Daugherty 
Johnson, Brent Wright, Mike Glasgow and (3} Warren Green with the LAN engineering firm. We are 
requesting your assistance in securing the availability of these individuais in the afternoon of 
Monday, November 23 or anytime on Tuesday, November 24. if preferable, we can contact these 
individuals directly for scheduling purposes and would request your assistance in ensuring this 
scheduling is appropriately prioritized. 

Please feel free to contact us through email or by telephone. Thank you for your assistance and 
cooperation in this important matter. 


Sincerely,

I just sent email to Tom Saxton at Treasury and attached our original letter to Henderson, which identifies those

Ken, 

Wayne and I spoke to Natasha this morning. She is on vacation. We delivered the message quite dearly and she should 
understand now that the Task Force is to have open access to key City individuals. Further, we indicated she does not 
need to be nor should she be present during those conversations. (See attached.) I did not have your list at the time of 
the conversation with her; my understanding is one of the individuals may no longer he engaged with the City. The 
bottom line is, if you still are having trouble reaching or talking to people, just let us know and we will follow up.

Thus far we have heard nothing reference to Flint putting an emergency declaration in place. Below is a link to 
a show called Current State. The new mayor mentions they need a disaster declaration.

Subject: Call with Matt Davis 

We had a great call with Matt, overall seemed very supportive of our recent efforts and intends to modify the letter to 
the Governor based on actions taken by MDHHS. 

Highlights from our discussion: 

• VERY PLEASED with today's release of information regarding lead testing 

• Matt supportive of our ICS-like structure (with project managed by Division of Environmental Health) - very 
much in line with centralized coordination and communication 

• Agrees with our proposal to use Medicaid population denominator as proxy for measuring progress in 
accelerating lead testing efforts 

• VERY pleased with the efforts to partner with, engage Medicaid Health Plans in the public health response 

• Had some suggestions for using MCIR as a tool to link children and their school districts to determine potential 
lead exposure 

• Agrees there is lack of consensus among community providers about testing infants, but Eden/Sue/Matt agree 
that there must be a risk assessment for lead exposure from water, infants are at highest risk for adverse effects. 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with several members of 
the Michigan Department of Health and Fluman Services (MDFIFIS) to discuss elements of the 10-point 
Action Plan designed to address various issues related to the recent occurrence of elevated levels of 
lead in the Flint water supply. This discussion was held at our request as part of our task to make 
recommendations to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing 
mitigation efforts. We also met with staff of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) 
on that same day, but at a separate meeting. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force 
participated in a conference call with yourself and several members of the Administration to discuss the 
progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Health Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing, given the potential for disruption of the lining of lead service lines. We will continue to 
assess state efforts and make recommendations regarding specific steps that we believe are warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger framework which measures results and the impact of these efforts. We believe this 
larger framework should address the following: 

1. The need for MDFIFIS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for 
contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups 
regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— independent of any one particular state 
agency— be established to provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the 
status of mitigation measures. For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be 
developed that reports on the goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint 
community, public health providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis 
mitigation program, as well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to 
assist in the development of that dashboard. 

We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in 
communication on this issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested 
dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance of our final report, we would like to ensure the 
independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding 
community trust in state actions. 



We appreciate your personal interest in this issue, commitment to assisting the Task Force in our 
review, and— most importantly— commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are 
brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully yours, 


Flint Water Advisory Task Force

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 

Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote public 
health and protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they relate to 
reducing lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is more work that 
must be done to ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health Department, local 
schools, and our partners in the non-profit community. 


l 



These partners are making progress, and we know we can always strive to improve practices and 
communication for continual improvement. 


You make a solid suggestion about establishing a person who is independent of any one of the involved state 
agencies or organizations to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am recommending that 
Harvey Hollins, director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the 
issue and the challenges faced by our cities and will be effective in this role. He will be assisted by senior 
members of our executive team to ensure you will have the continued support and cooperation that you need. 
We also have retained Chris DeWitt, a veteran communications specialist, to strengthen community outreach 
efforts to make sure residents have access to the information they need. 

I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more 
accessible to the Flint community. These are critical measures that can be used as we look the challenges and 
progress in Flint, but also can be a part of efforts moving forward in other areas of our state. It’s important that 
people have confidence that we are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to 
improve interaction among city, state and federal agencies. We also will continue to work with the medical 
community to consider how we can work together on wraparound needs of children who might experience 
health problems. 

People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the water 
coming out of their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - at all levels - 
is working effectively to protect them. 

I thank you again for investing your time and expertise to this vitally important effort. 

Regards,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

December 11, 2015 (517)241-2112 

MDHHS releases latest round of Flint blood lead level data 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued its 
newest summary report on lead testing in Flint. According to preliminary data, 39 of 1,836 adults 
and children tested had elevated blood lead levels since Oct. 1. 

“As testing continues, our focus remains on helping families reduce all potential exposures to 
lead,” said Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive. “We are working closely with the 
Genesee County Health Department to provide information and offer tools in the community, 
and encourage families to explore the resources that are available to them.” 

Both capillary and venous blood tests are included in the report, and people who have had 
multiple tests are counted only once. Tests and their results cover the time since the state action 
plan was put in place on Oct. 2, and capture the number of elevated blood lead levels greater than 
5 micrograms per deciliter. 

MDHHS is working closely with local partners to offer resources and distribute important lead 
testing and prevention information. Additional state funding has allowed for Genesee County 
Health Department (GCHD) nurses to work with families when an elevated blood lead level is 
detected. These families can also choose to have the nurse coordinate an environmental health 
investigation in their home to identify lead exposures, which could be lead from paint, soil, 
plumbing, and other sources. 

To support these efforts, the state is coordinating with its Medicaid health plans and provider 
communities on enhanced screening and testing. In addition to mandated testing at ages one and 
two for the Medicaid population, MDHHS has recommended blood lead testing for any child 
younger than six years of age in Flint who has not previously been tested. The state, in 
coordination with GCHD, developed and issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) notification for 
local providers to help ensure consistent messaging and protocols among primary care providers. 

Free water filters and replacement cartridges are still available to Flint residents. For a full list of 
locations and hours of distribution, or to view the full blood lead level report, visit 
www.michigan.gov/flintwater . The summary will be updated as more data becomes available. 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional video on its YouTube channel . For this and 
other updates, visit www~.michigan.gov/flintwater .

Dear Flint Wafer Advisory Task Feme; Members! 

Thabk you for your correspondence on Dec, 7, and, most importantiy, for your hard 
work to promote: pybiio health and: protect our residents as we move ferward, Tour 
efforts are both respected and appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in 
Flint as they relate to reducing lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since 
October, and recognize there is more work that must be done to ensure that this 
progress continues, 

At tha state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Departments of 
Environmental Quality and the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate 
with the Genesee Qouniy Health Department, iocal schools, and our partners in the 
nchrproit txtmmurtfty: 

These partners are making progress, and we know we must always strive to improve 
practices and communication for Continual improvement 

You make a solid recommendation to establish a person whois independent of any one 
of the involved state agencies to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing 
work. J am recommending that Harvey Hollins, director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, 
carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the issues and the challenges faced by our 
cities and will be effective in this role. Senior members of our executive foam will 
continue to; engage with your task force and provide direction and support to Harvey to 
ensure you will hive continued support and cooperation, We also have retained Chris 
DeWitt, a veteran communications specialist, tostrengf hen comrourilfy outreach efforts 
to make sure; residents have access to the information they need, 

1 also support your auggesf on of a daslpoprii to make information about our work and 
progress more accessible to the Flint community. These are critical measuresthat can 
be used as we look the challenges and progress in Flint, but also; can fee a part of efforts 
moving: fb ward in other areas of our state. it’s important that people have confidence 
that we are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to 
improve interaction among city, state and federal agencies. We also will continue to 
work with the medical community to consider how we can work together on wraparound 
needs of childrini who might experience health problems.

The Detroit Free Press printed a column yesterday on the Flint water situation. I wanted to provide some clarity 
from my perspective. The AG’s Office had sent us what we call litigation holds. See the attached files. 


We do have a FOIA from Mr. Edwards that predates the initial hold. We had received the FOIA request and 
had indicated we had approved it to Mr. Edwards, and would begin compiling the information and forward 
pending payment. After the approval we received the first litigation hold notice from the AG’s Office. Because 
of the hold for potential litigation, we felt it was prudent to vet the FOIA request with the AG’s Office. We did 
notify Mr. Edwards of this. I don’t believe that there will be an issue with his request and we will continue to 
be open and transparent with the public. We do have to redact personally information, such as personal health 
information or information that could be used to identify an individual (such as address or social security), but 
that should be expected. 


Once the FOIA is complete (either tomorrow or early next week) we will send to Mr. Edwards. I will forward 
a copy to you two as well.

Virginia Tech Researcher Claims Stonewalling On Lead Data 

The Department of Flealth and Fluman Services had data that showed there were elevated lead levels in Flint's 
water, but delayed in releasing that data to others for review, Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards said in an 
article posted to his website documenting the city's water crisis. 

Department officials agreed and said the experience led to changes in how they examine data. 

Mr. Edwards said the department had data from shortly after Flint changed its water source that showed a spike 
in blood lead levels in children in two at-risk neighborhoods, but did not disclose that data until September 
2015. 

"They discovered scientifically conclusive evidence of an anomalous increase in childhood lead poisoning in 
summer 2014 immediately after the switch in water sources, but stood by silently as Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) officials repeatedly and falsely stated that no spike in blood lead levels (BLL) 
of children had occurred," he said in the post. 

DHHS spokesperson Jennifer Eisner agreed the department had data that showed the spike, but said its analysis 
at the time overlooked factors that, in retrospect, would have shown there was a water quality problem. 

"When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase appeared to 
be consistent with the seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months," Ms. Eisner said. "It wasn't until the 
Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by ZIP code, controlling 
for seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result of this process, we have 
determined that the way we analyze data collected needs to be thoroughly reviewed." 

Mr. Edwards said DHHS officials also stonewalled him on getting access to that data. 

He said data he had gotten easily in 2006 documents for a similar review took several weeks to receive after his 
request sent September 2. When he did finally receive the data, he said it was a version that omitted the lead 
level spike from summer 2014 that the department had created in July. 

He said a series of emails he received under a recent Freedom of Information Act request showed and intention 
by DHHS officials to keep the reports from the public. 

"Our FOIA reveals a shocking DHHS graph created in October 2015. It shows the statistically significant spike 
in blood lead that occurred in summer 2014 - the scientific result that DHHS has never publicly acknowledged," 
Mr. Edwards said in his post. 

Ms. Eisner said the department has worked to make the data available. "Summary reports outlining blood lead 
level testing are posted online on a bi-weekly basis, and we work closely with local partners to fulfill data 
requests as we receive them," she said.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has consistently provided information 
regarding blood lead levels in the city of Flint. 

When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase 
appeared to be consistent with the routine seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months. It wasn't 
until the Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by ZIP 
code, controlling for seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result 
of this process, we have determined that the way we analyze data needs to be thoroughly reviewed. 
Additionally, Gov. Rick Snyder has created a Flint Water Task Force to review all city, state and federal 
responses and actions and is expected to make recommendations moving forward. 

Our department is focused on ensuring that appropriate case management and follow up is occurring in 
Flint. Summary reports outlining blood lead level testing are posted online on a bi-weekly basis, and we 
are working closely with local partners to fulfill data requests as we receive them. 

Regarding the FOIA, Mr. Edwards received all of the requested documents, with personal information 
redacted, on Friday, December 18.

TAKING ACTION ON FLINT WATER 

[I would start off with an apology.. ."Among the things our citizens have a right to expect from their 
government is clean, safe water. In Flint's case, government failed them on many levels. As the Chief 
Executive of the state, I apologize for these failures and am absolutely committed to making things right. I 
would ask that all of our leaders at the local, state and federal level, work with me to solve the immediate 
problems and put in place long term measures to monitor and address the consequences from exposure. I 
also want to thank Dr. Mona Attisha Hannah and Dr. Marc Edwards for their diligence in making sure I 
understood the severity of the problem.] 


• Flint deserves safe drinking water. 


• The issues around Flint's drinking water represent the challenges of aging infrastructure. 


• As Governor, I am committed to addressing the issue. 


• Lead exposure is a serious issue. 


• I appreciate those who have brought attention to this issue. 


• We are committed to safe drinking water and to working in partnership with the city of Flint 
and the U.S. EPA. 


• We must learn from what happened in Flint. 


• In October, I announced a ten point action plan to address lead exposure in Flint. 


l 



• Today, I am outlining additional actions to make sure the public health is protected in Flint and 
elsewhere in the State of Michigan. 


• I am asking for changes in order to see that the Michigan Drinking Water Program becomes a national 
leader in public health protection. 

On October 2, 2015 the Flint Water Action Plan was announced. With the help of the Michigan Legislature and 
the Mott Foundation, we have taken significant action to address the issue. Actions include: 

• Switching back to the Great Lakes Water Authority/DWSD water supply (October 16, 2015) 


• Provided water filters to residents of Flint. (DHHS to provide update) [Distribution has been a problem- 
are we addressing it?] 


• Testing all Flint schools, preschools and day cares. Summary of results to date. (George to provide) 


• Expanded health exposure testing of individual residences. Summary of results to date. (Nick to provide) 


• Offer water testing at no cost to Flint residents to assure safe water. Summary of results to date. (George 
to provide) 


• Expedite optimizing corrosion control in the Flint drinking water system. Summary of date 
completed. (George to summarize) 


• Utilize the "Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee." To ensure the best technology, practices 
and science are being utilized; national experts have been assembled to provide technical advice. [Will you 
include Dr. Mona? Larry Reynolds? Mark Edwards?] 


• Accelerate water system improvement to address replacement of lead service lines. We are working with 
the city of Flint and our Congressional delegation on a lead service line replacement plan. 


• Working to expedite the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


• Expand a lead education program. 
(DHF1S to provide update) 


2 



• Dr. Eden Wells was named as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor to ensure safe drinking water. 


[Dr. Larry Reynolds was named to the Flint After Action Task Force]. 


In addition to the announced Flint Action plan, I am calling for additional actions to be taken. 

• Recently appointed Harvey Hollins to serve as my administration's point person to coordinate ongoing 
activities and partner with the city of Flint. 


• Asking the DEQto develop a statewide drinking water school testing program. 


• Asking for changes in the Michigan Drinking Water Program in order for it to be recognized as a national 
leader in public health including: 

o New administrative leadership, 
o Creation of corrosion control expertise, 
o Expanded statewide testing, 
o Improved testing protocols. 


• The creation of a health fund for children affected by lead exposure. 


• Calling on the Legislature to work with my administration and stakeholders to develop a Strategic Water 
Fund to address Michigan's long term safe water and water quality infrastructure needs. [This can't get 
lost. Need more to educate people that our infrastructure is old, that the average city of 50,000 or more 
likely requires $$$ in remediation. At some point the anti corrosive treatment is not likely to be sufficient.] 


• I will look to implement additional recommendations of the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, and I 
appreciate their leadership on this issue.

Rich: 



I want to give you a heads up: the Task Force will be sending a letter to the Governor tomorrow am that states 
the primary — not the only, but certainly the primary— responsibility for the Flint Water crisis lies at the feet of 
the MDEQ. We will address three failures: (1) regulatory culture in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal 
Assistance; (2) inappropriate and unacceptable public response; and (3) inadequate application of the Lead and 
Copper Rule. 

We address the critical and urgent need to establish responsibility and hold individuals accountable as soon as 
possible. 

It is our intent to send the letter via email tomorrow, with a public release Wednesday am... 

The Task Force— both individually and collectively— feel strongly about the need for us to be on record now 
rather than later. 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Dear Governor Snyder: 


The Flint Water Advisory Task Force, which you appointed on October 21, 2015, has devoted 
considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply: 
what happened, why it occurred, and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in 
the state. We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short- and long- 
term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the 
health and well being of the Flint community. 

Shortly after we began our work, we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the 
state's response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint, and for assignment of a single person to 
provide this coordination. We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7, 2015, and you 
responded with immediate adoption of these recommendations. We thank you for the commitment 
your response demonstrates. 

In our continuing efforts, we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels; 
reviewed many documents, articles, and emails; and deliberated repeatedly as a group. Both individually 
and as a group, we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens, 
public health officials and healthcare providers, individuals who have water management 
responsibilities at the city and county levels, and other public officials. 

It is clear to us, particularly as we listen to the people of Flint, that it is both critical and urgent to 
establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability. This is a 
first step in a long process to re-establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the 
agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health. It is urgent because this deep distrust of 
government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address 
ongoing public health issues. It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time. 

We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels 
contributed to creating and prolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has 
responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be 
held accountable for that failure. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the 
public water system. In this instance, the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system 
within SDWA requirements, under the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure 
compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement 
responsibility for the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways. 

Regulatory Failure 

We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (ODWMA) at MDEQ, a culture 
exists in which "technical compliance" is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan. 
This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply 
insufficient to the task of public protection. It led to MDEQ's failure to recognize a number of indications 
that switching the water source in Flint would— and did— compromise both water safety and water 
quality. The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were, and continue to be, justified on the basis that 
federal rules "allowed" those decisions to be made. ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by 



this minimalist technical compliance approach, but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be 
done to assure drinking water safety. 


A culture change must occur within ODWMA. It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational 
regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan's drinking water. We 
believe, and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant, that as a Great Lakes State, Michigan should 
aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation, rather than merely aiming for technical 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Failure in Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public 

Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted 
and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, 
belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone 
and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable. In a real way, the 
MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in 
public statements. We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety 
of issues, including testing protocol, interpretation of testing results, the requirements of federal law 
and rules, and other matters. What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses, however, is their persistent 
tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the 
work of others— who ultimately proved to be right— than to pursue its own oversight responsibility. 

Failure in MDEQ Interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule 

The federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) is central to what happened in Flint, because that rule, at least 
theoretically, is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination of drinking water. The federal LCR 
calls for "optimized corrosion control treatment," which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the 
Flint River. Prior to the switch, MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion 
control treatment (CCT) was not necessary until two six-month monitoring periods had been conducted. 
The need for CCT would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were 
reviewed. The decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the 
contamination of the Flint water system. 

The MDEQ seems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint 
situation. It first maintained that it followed the LCR, then stated that it did not follow the rule properly, 
and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum issued by the US EPA in early November 2015 
suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct. 

We are not convinced. Even the MDEQ's latest interpretation of the US EPA's November memorandum 
is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR, which is to minimize risks of lead and 
copper exposure for human health. 

We believe ODWMA's single-minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem, and it is part of the 
"technical compliance" culture described above. ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a 
legally possible interpretation of the LCR. It should be focusing on how to protect Michigan's citizens 
from lead in drinking water. 

We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16, 2015, to discuss these issues, as well as many 
others. We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions, particularly as it relates to the 
regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency. It is our understanding that he has 
drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation of the MDEQ's role in the Flint water crisis. At the same 





time, it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA's November 
2015 memorandum. 


We are not finished with our work. Other individuals and entities made poor decisions, contributing to 
and prolonging the contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint. As an example, we are 
particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDHHS's apparent early knowledge of, yet silence 
about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint's children. We also feel it important to further 
review local government decision processes under emergency management. Our final report will 
highlight and discuss those concerns, among many others, to provide some context to a comprehensive 
series of recommendations. As stated earlier in this letter, however, we believe that establishing 
responsibility is a critical and urgent need, and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016 . 
Individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion. 

It is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to 
make Michigan safer, particularly for its children. Drinking water must be recognized as a potential 
source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or 
compromised. Proper testing, not only in high-risk areas but also in facilities serving children (e.g., 
schools), must be considered. Facilitating long-term financing of a model public health program, and 
also replacement of lead-containing water service lines and fixtures, would enable Michigan to realize a 
positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis. Our final report will address some of 
these issues. 

The City of Flint's water customers— fellow Michigan citizens— were needlessly and tragically exposed to 
toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply. They deserve a commitment to properly assess 
responsibility and ensure accountability. They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both 
the short and long term. The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Flaving failed to prevent it, 
state government should coordinate a sustained, public-health-focused response to remedy, to the 
fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community.

Gents, 

it has occurred to me for some time that perhaps, rather than DOC, our next Agencies might be DEG followed by DNR. If 
they can't test water, who knows what else is lurking in the weeds? i suspect your report back on DEQ. might have 
indicated as much. 


i also trust by now that PwC has been told that Bernard's project is coming to an end. Wiii that make them a bit more 
receptive to my win/win, or are they going to keep pushing Bernard? Speaking of which, we need a little organization to 
the MDARD pilot program, I suggested it to cause PwC/Bernard to put their cards on the table. Just what is it exactly 
they propose and how will it produce a more cost effective result than OpEx? Whatever it is, they should be obligated 
to put it on paper. 

Now, I suggest that we have a meeting to get the rules straight. It might be appropriate for Mike to chair it, I assume he 
is the point guy on resolution. It will also keep PwC honest, i don't want to waste all this knowledge Mike is acquiring. 

Finally, I would be interested in what Jamie, Gordon, and Ken think about this. At the last Bernard meeting, 1 asked each 
of them to consider where we would have been had we followed the Bernard methodology ail the way into MDARD 
compared with where we are now. Without hesitation, they all responded separately that it would have been the same 
place, i rest my case. 

It would be interesting to ask Nick/Sally and David/Brom the same question. Something tells me I know the answer. 


Finally, if Bernard's project is going to yield real results, it needs to provide the Agency level objectives that the plan 
envisions. I suspect Bernard will avoid that arguing that it can't be clone until the Agencies are "mapped." Again, our 
results indicate that such is not the case. If he does not do so, then we will do it as part of Op Ex. As i noted, that is what 
we are doing now, DEQ. is responsible for protecting us and the environment That is their objective. How they do it to 
a much enhanced level of consistent excellence is what OpEx is ail about. No mystery, 

111 be in Lansing next week from about 4 on Monday through Thursday. Friday will find me at GRHV. Mike, perhaps we 
could find time for a quick chat. 

Happy New Year. I am looking forward to a very productive year. You have great people. They are fired up and really 
contributing. This is all about building momentum. We must keep them focused, let them understand what we are 
doing and let them begin to experience victory. That is what is now happening, it can only build. However, we must 
protect or credibility as the naysayers will quickly point to any breach,

SV5IRS BREAKING NEWS: Wyant Resigns As IVIDEG Director ~ 
3:09 PSVi 


Dan WYANT, the director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(MDEQ), is resigning in the wake of criticism about how the state handled elevated lead 
levels in Flint drinking water. 

Gov. Rick SNYDER announced Wyant's resignation in a statement today. Also, in the 
statement, the Governor said his administration would invite scientists who have been 
tracking the situation “to be our partners in helping us improve Flint water.” 

“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened,” 
Snyder's statement added. “And I want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn 
from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure.” 

On Wyant, Snyder said Wyant offered his resignation, “and I've determined that it's 
appropriate to accept it.” 

“I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the 
task force,” Snyder's statement said. 

Those other changes haven't been finalized yet, according to Laura BIEHL, a 
spokesperson for the Governor. 


2 




The news of Wyant's resignation comes as a task force continues to work on a report 
about the Flint water crisis, which occurred after the city's water source was switched to 
the Flint River in 2014. 

“Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, members have made me 
aware of some interim findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take 
immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe and 
informed,” Snyder said today. He continued, “We'll continue to work with the community 
members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns.” 

Snyder also noted the he called Flint Mayor Karen WEAVER last week and the two are 
going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

Wyant has been MDEQ director since Snyder took office in 201 1 . 

Previously, Wyant was the director of the Department of Agriculture under former Govs. 
John ENGLER and Jennifer GRANHOLM.

Thoughts on Next Steps 

IAP Flint Water 2015-12-29.pdf 


Below are some of my initial points to assist with the EO creation. I have not been able to review the local Incident 

Action Plan so that could change some of the below but my guess is that it will add objectives to it. I attached the IAP 

from Flint in case it did not go through earlier. 

• Before anything can be accomplished, coordination between all parties must be established. We must establish a 
routine information process between all parties. 

• Other avenues of funding must be pursued including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• While the Emergency Management Act or Stafford may be the best mechanism to fix the issues in Flint, portions of 
the Emergency Management Act outlining management of events are applicable and should be implemented (e.g. 
Local emergency operations plans/emergency operations guides as well as emergency operations support plans). 

Action Plan 

• If a request for a Governor's declaration is received from the county, evaluate the request and provide a 
recommendation whether to issue a declaration. 

• Establish an interagency workgroup comprised minimally of DHHS, MDEQ, and MSP. Consideration should be given 
to including Civil Rights. Additional agencies/stakeholders who can assist with accomplishing the action plan may be 
needed. Personnel should be goal oriented and be able to work toward accomplishing the Incident Action Plan 
created by the state in a timely manner. 

• If an EO and/or an Interagency workgroup is created, it must compliment and not replace the current system under 
the Emergency Management Act. 

• The workgroup should utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as 
appropriate. 

• Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive, and legislative levels as determined 
appropriate. 

• Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 

1 . Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 

■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods. 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community of the situation and actions 
taken. 

■ Identify existing Public Information outlets within the city, county, and state. 

■ Determine official information flow and approval of information. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 


l 



■ Develop priorities, costs, and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades as part of a long 
term recovery plan. 

■ Implement the plan.

CITY OF FLINT 

INCIDENT ACTION PLAN 

STATE OF EMERGENCY 


Objectives: 


To provide short term relief and long term solutions in addressing the man-made emergency of 
increased lead levels in the City of Flint (the "City") water system resulting from the switch to Flint River 
as the City's water source as well as the threat to public health related to elevated blood lead levels in 
Flint residents, without interruption of the provision of public safety and other essential public services. 
Due to the fluidic nature of emergencies and the complexity of the City of Flint's declared emergency, 
this plan serves as a framework and may be altered as the emergency develops. 

The Response Framework 

The purpose of this plan is to organize efforts on behalf of the city to assess the extent of the City's 
infrastructure needs and risks to public health, provide immediate relief to those who are at risk, and 
establish long term solutions. In addition, the city must ascertain what immediate relief and long term 
solutions the City is capable of implementing based on what resources are available. For any activities 
that are beyond the resource capacity of the City, external sources of funding, supplies, and manpower 
must be sought. 

There are a number of steps that must be taken in accordance with the Flint Emergency Support 
Operations Plan (SEOP), in order for the City to be compliant with the Genesee County Emergency 
Action Guidelines. These include the activation of the Incident Management Team, the Emergency 
Operation Center, and the sharing of essential documents with the County, including this plan. 
Information must also be shared by the City's Public Information Officer on a regular basis, as required 
by the SEOP. 

This plan calls for the provision of immediate relief to those at risk in our community. Special 
consideration must be given to residents who belong to underserved groups, such as those who are 
homebound, undocumented, in poverty, etc. Additional consideration must also be given to the 
equitable provision of services throughout our community in order to equally protect the health and 
safety of every member of our community. 

Implementation of this plan is to be conducted by the Incident Management Team, which will monitor 
the effective delivery of goods and services in order to address the conditions of the emergency. 

Understanding the Issue: 

October 1, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a Public Health Emergency after 
elevated blood-lead levels were found among children in the City of Flint. This incident correlates with 
elevated levels of lead found in the City's drinking water after the City switched water sources in April of 


2014 to the Flint River. The scope of this problem appears to be limited to Flint City Water Customers 
and their dependents. Public agencies from several levels of government, as well as charitable, nonprofit 
organizations have partnered with the City to provide immediate relief to Flint residents, including the 
expansion of health services, the provision of bottled water and NSF rated water filters. The city is also 
seeking long term infrastructure improvements to eliminate lead and other contaminants from the 
water system. 

Gov. Rick Snyder appointed a task force to review "actions regarding water use and testing in Flint" and 
to make recommendations for future guidelines: Members of the state task force are Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants, Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council, Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center. 

In an effort to halt the further escalation of this crisis, the City returned to receiving its water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) on October 16, 2015. Since that time, additional 
corrosion control program has started, estimating a reduction of lead levels over the next six months. In 
light of these efforts, concerns surrounding the quality of water and health of the residents persist to 
the point that Mayor Karen Weaver declared a State of Emergency on December 14, 2015 so as to 
resolve this crisis once and for all. 

The current challenge facing the City is providing immediate relief and long term solutions of the quality 
of the water and health of residents while the City remains in a financially critical condition. It is hoped 
and expected that higher levels of government recognize this emergency as it pertains to the condition 
of the City's infrastructure and health of its residents, and do all things necessary to assist the City in the 
provision of relief and the execution of capital improvement projects that will eliminate the causes of 
this emergency. 

Enhancing Understanding: 

Information Collection 

Essential Elements of Information (EEls) can be qualified as the City's water tests containing lead results, 
the verification of lead water lines (both public and private), and health information. Water testing is 
performed by the City's water plant in cooperation with the MDEQ.. The verification of lead water lines is 
being handled by University of Michigan Flint, who is currently digitizing the City's water line 
information and PSI Engineering, who is initiating the effort to verify lead lines by excavating an initial 
150 residential lines. This information allows the Incident Management Team to assess the current 
condition of the emergency by way of determining the water quality and the condition of the water 
distribution infrastructure. 


Information Analysis 

The City has sought partners to assist in the analysis and attenuation of complex data. Wayne State 
University's center for Urban Studies has agreed to assist the City in its efforts to document and track 
lead water lines, water test results, and filter distribution with geographic information system (GIS) 
technology. This allows for easily updateable, digestible information to be presented to officials. 

Assessment of Impacts 

The City will need assistance in determining the total cost of damage done to the public health and 
infrastructure. As of now, only portions of this damage are visible. 

PSI is providing some assistance by excavating 150 residential water lines to verify that they are 
comprised of lead. This is an initial step, but not enough. More resources will be needed to continue this 
process. 

Continuous Situational Awareness 

It is important that the Emergency Management Team receive continuous information regarding water 
testing results, lead water line numbers, and filter distribution information in order to gain a realistic 
and current perspective. Much of his information is currently available on the City's website 
(cityofflint.com) and more is added each week by the PIO team. 

Actions taken in Response to the Emergency 

Activation of the Incident Management Team 

Upon the declaration of Emergency by Mayor Weaver, the Support Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP) 
was activated. The SEOP calls upon the Incident Management Team to generate the Incident Action Plan 
(IAP. Each member of this team serves a specific function as it relates to addressing the causes and 
effects of the emergency. The Emergency Management Team roster can be found in the SEOP on page 
3, with a list of alternates on page 4 in case the need for succession arises. 

Emergency Operations Center 

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) must be activated upon the declaration of a State of 
Emergency by the Mayor. This center is required by the SEOP and serves as a nerve center for the 
Incident Management Team. Here, emergency relief efforts are coordinated by key members of the 
Incident Management Team. In this case, these relief efforts consist of the distribution of water filters at 



City Hall and community events, the distribution of bottled water throughout the city in conjunction 
with the efforts of community partners, and assisting with the circulation of water testing kits 
throughout the community. The EOC will also be monitoring and managing the inventory of relief 
supplies, such as water filters and bottled water. 

According to the SEOP, the EOC must establish an incident tracking system. This system will serve as a 
work plan for the management of the emergency. In addition, it is essential that the IMT record water 
testing results, lead water line location information, and information about the distribution of water 
filters and bottled water all in one place so that information is readily available for the Incident 
Management Team. This information will also be sent out to the public and media in the form of daily 
regular updates by the City's PIO. 

Communication 

The EOC maintains a telephone system that exists to intake questions about relief efforts and to 
organize relief logistics. It is open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. A voicemail system and 
eventual email system will exist to handle requests and inquiries that occur outside of the normal 
operating hours. This system will be constructed by the City's IS department. 

Public Awareness and Education 

1. Emergency Alerts and Updates: 

The City's Public Information Officer will make available information as it relates to the 
emergency in the form of press releases, emails, and physical documents. Daily updates 
containing information on the distribution of water filters, bottled water, water testing, blood 
lead testing, and other relief efforts will be available on the City's website for the public to view. 
Information will be available at City Hall for residents. 

2. Joint Information Center: 

The City's PIO will establish a joint Information Center that is organized to coordinate the efforts 
of multiple agencies to communicate with the public. This includes the circulation of joint press 
releases, public health information, educational materials, and updates relating to the State of 
Emergency. This committee is comprised of public information officers and public relations 
personnel to coordinate efforts to keep the public updated and informed. Regular updates to 
the media regarding events and progress will be made as news develops. 

The US EPA has offered assistance in the form of Public Information support. Additional support 
in this area has been provided by the Michigan State Police. 


3. Education: 

Many government agencies and philanthropic organizations are already distributing information 
regarding the effects of lead on public health. It is important that the City assist in these efforts 
so vital information and knowledge is presented to all members of the community. The goal is to 
continue to eliminate misunderstandings and incorrect information as it relates to reducing lead 
in drinking water, pursuing medical help, and maintaining a healthy diet to reduce lead 
absorption in the body. Lead education is currently being performed by the Genesee County 
Health Department, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Medical 
community at-large. 


Assessment of Social Needs 

In order to effectively and equitably provide immediate relief to Flint water customers, the City must 
take into account many of the socio-economic needs and limitations of the community. Some residents 
cannot get to City Hall for a water filter. Some residents do not have internet access. Literacy or a 
language barrier may also pose significant obstacles to the effective distribution of educational 
information and relief to those in need. These will be continuing challenges facing the community. At 
present these are the resources the City has available to mitigate some of those challenges. 

Logistics 


Logistics are being coordinated by the City Emergency Management Team's City's Chief Logistics Officer, 
who is the City Administrator. The CLO is responsible for the coordination, procurement, and 
transportation of goods and services, which is essential for effective implementation of the response 
plan. 

Fixed Distribution Points 

There are several locations throughout the city where residents may acquire a water filter. These 
locations are: 


Flint City Hall 

1101 South Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 

Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) 

601 North Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 
and 

2727 Lippencott Blvd, Flint Ml 48507 



Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 

4809 Clio Road, Flint Ml 48504 
and 

125 E. Union Street, Flint, Ml 48502 

Activation of Ward Distribution Centers 

Each of the nine wards will have activated distribution centers that are primarily managed by City 
Council Members or their designees.

Mobile Distribution Centers 

With the help of transportation agencies, like the Metro Transit Authority (MTA), meals on wheels, and 
GCCARD, the city can help establish mobile distribution centers and delivery systems that can provide 
water filters, bottled water, and nutritious foods, among other types of relief accompanied by 
educational materials to neighborhoods and to homes of people who experience limited mobility. 

• Mass Transportation Authority-MTA bus passes: Assisting residents with bus passes to 
improve their mobility will increase their chances of receiving help. Transportation 
services will also improve residents' access to medical care. 

• MTA-Your Ride mobile distribution: 

0 Estimated Costs: $25 per hour to deliver water and filters to homes throughout 
the City. 

Problem 1. Public Health Emergency 

The first objective in addressing this emergency is reducing, and eventually eliminating, the danger to 
public health. As City water coming out of faucets continue to contain lead, and copper and other 


7 


































harmful contaminants exceeding government guidelines and regulations, it poses a risk to the people of 
our community. Preventative measures must be taken to avoid the effects of toxicosis that are difficult if 
not impossible to completely reverse. 

As far as preventative measures are concerned, education, water filters, and bottled water must be 
provided to every household in the City in order to reduce the chances of lead exposure, especially to 
our most vulnerable members of the community. If lead exposure has occurred, resulting in elevated 
blood lead levels, immediate and sustained medical attention must be available to those affected. 

Health services must be expanded in the area to accommodate increased numbers of case loads and 
specialized care regarding lead poisoning and its effects. 

Immediate Relief for Public Health: 

1. Prevention: Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing, and bottled 
water must be available to everyone. 

2. Access to nutritious food that reduces the risks of lead absorption by the body. The City can 
coordinate activities with the County Health Department 

Long Term Solutions: Maintaining Public Health and Coping with Lead Exposure 

1. Work closely with the Genesee County Health Department and Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services in order to provide sustainable care and monitoring of children exposed to 
lead. This care must be available for them for several years-preferably several decades. 

2. Support and education for primary care providers regarding aggressive long-term 
neurodevelopmental screening and testing. 

3. Improved access to developmental and behavioral (DBP) specialists, pediatric psychologists, 
pediatric psychiatrists. 

a. Pre-emptive referral to mental health/ toxic stress screenings. 

b. Support capacity building and or incentivize recruitment to allow Genesee health system 
(CMH) to build this capacity which is currently needed and lacking. 

4. Increase recognition and education regarding trauma informed care, social determinants of 
health (SDOH). 

5. Expand State funded Genesee Health System (CMH) services. 

a. Infant mental health (30 day capacity) 

b. Child case management 

c. Home based services 

d. Trauma informed care- trauma focused CBT 

Problem 2. Lead Contamination in the Water 
Immediate Relief: 


1. Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing for water customers, and 
bottled water must be available to everyone. Water filters can be obtained at any of the fixed 
distribution points throughout the City. 

2. Identification and verification of lead water service lines throughout the city- both public and 
private. 

3. Assistance to identify lead pipes within buildings and homes. 

Distribution of Bottled Water: 

At this point, we are directing all offers for donations to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan. It is 
imperative that water be accessible to all members of the community through a variety of distribution 
channels. These channels are explained in the Logistics Section of this plan. 

Distribution of Test Bottles: 

Water testing kits can be picked up at City Hall with instructions. Test results are posted on the City's 
website to raise public awareness and encourage more participation. 

Long term Solutions: Capital Improvements Needs 

The distribution of filters, water, and food to counter the effects of lead are essential response efforts to 
keep people safe. However, long term solutions are required to keep people healthy, to eliminate lead 
from the public and private water distribution system distribution, and to provide affordable clean 
water. Our public infrastructure and utilities must be reliable, sustainable, and equitable in order for this 
community to rebound after this emergency. The following long term solutions must be implemented in 
order to set the City of Flint on a course for recovery. These solutions come at a heavy cost for a City 
that is currently in receivership. The City has experienced financial distress due to this Emergency, in 
addition to a two million dollar loss from switching back to DWSD. The City has diligently applied for 
Fiscally Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships, Grant in order to supplement funding for capital 
improvement projects. It is essential that these grants be awarded in order to achieve long term 
solutions. 

1. COUPLETS Transition to a Temporary Safe Water Source until the Completion of KWA: 

This has already occurred. On October 16, 2015, Flint returned to receiving its water from DWSD 
on a 9 month agreement. This agreement will expire in June 2016, when the KWA is projected to 
be complete. The City had to pay $2 million out of its general fund to make this switch. 

2, UN PROGRESS Additional Corrosion Control added to the Water System: 


This is already occurring. In early December, 2015, Flint began to add additional corrosion 
control to the water coming in from DWSD in attempts to rebuild the protective scale inside its 
pipes. This is estimated to reduce lead levels in two to six months. 

3. Faucet Replacement: 

Replacement of Water faucets, and drinking fountains in the school system. It has been 
determined after state inspections that many sources of lead contamination in the School 
System's water were the faucets themselves. These faucets need to be replaced. 

4. Water Line Replacement: 

Water Line Replacement to reduce antiquated infrastructure and lead service lines. These lines 
must be identified, verified, and replaced. Residents who are facing financial hardships must 
have access to assistance to cover the costs of these replacements through access to grants and 
(forgivable) loans made available through State and Federal agencies. The corrosion damage to 
public and private lines that Flint River water caused is still being determined. 

• Replacement of an estimated fifteen thousand (15,000) lead service lines at an 

estimated cost of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per line. Total costs forty -five million 
dollars ($45,000,000). This project is estimated to be one of the most cost-intensive 
endeavors related to ameliorating water contaminants. 

5. Reimbursement of Critical Expenditures: 

Seeking reimbursement of two million dollar cost of returning to DWSD and forgiveness of 
Water Revolving Loan Debt from the State of Michigan. 


6. KWA Capital Improvements: The City has reconnected to Detroit temporarily until a water line 
from Port Huron is developed. The new water line known as the KWA pipeline or Karegnondi 
Water Authority is expected to bring water to the City from Lake Huron by July. The current cost 
agreement between Flint and DWSD is for nine months, therefore it is imperative that KWA be 
completed as soon as possible. Assistance relating to capital improvements to expedite this 
process will help to achieve long term goals. 


KWA Capital Improvements: 

a. Transfer Station to Dort Reservoir 

b. Raw water line to pump station #4 

c. Phosphoric acid feed system 

d. Alum Feed system 

e. Post filtration system 


Estimated Costs: 

$4,500,000 

$636,000 

$186,000 

$40,000 

$387,289 


/. SCADA Upgrades 
g. Sewer Relining 

Total 


$424,000 

$100,000 

$6,273,289 


Ancillary Considerations: Public Safety during an Emergency 

During a time of emergency public safety agencies need to be prepared to respond to threats to public 
safety and critical infrastructure. The City is facing a man-made emergency that is threatening the public 
health. Resentment and hostility toward local institutions and municipal government is at a significant 
level. 

Critical infrastructure should be safeguarded if the need arises. This includes increasing security at City 
Hall to reduce potential for public safety risks. In the case of credible threats to public infrastructure, it 
may be required to hire private security company for first line of defense. Private Security is lower cost, 
thereby making it the first option. The minimum response is acted upon first, elevating only if the need 
arises. Credible or imminent threats of damage or destruction to critical infrastructure requires an 
elevated response. Such needs may require over-time police officers to address critical situations. 
Mutual aid from surrounding communities can be requested if Flint public safety is overextended. 

Implementation: 

Community Partners 

Financial limitations of the city persist while it confronts this emergency. Many community partners 
have offered their assistance to perform various needed functions. The city is heavily reliant on the 
assistance that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have provided. 

The Mott Foundation 

The Mott Foundation has provided financial assistance, especially in their generous contribution of $4 
million. In addition, the Mott Foundation has recently pledged an additional 

United Way 

The Genesee County United Way has provided significant financial assistance in the way of purchasing 
and helping to distribute water filters since the public health emergency began on October 1 st , 2015. 

Genesee County Community Action Resources Department (GCCARD) 


11 


GCCARD is organized to fight poverty and has been a primary partner in the distribution of water filters. 
It has also regularly supported the city with the logistics and availability of water filters at City Hall. 

Genesee County Health Department 

Has provided educational information to Flint Water customers 

Genesee County Board of Commissioners 

The Board of Commissioners have pledged their support to help Flint seek solutions to this crisis. The 
Board has already assisted in making health and nutrition information available to the public. 

Assistance from Wayne State University 

Wayne State University's Center for Urban Studies will be providing technical GIS support to assist in the 
documentation of emergency relief efforts. 

The US Environmental Protection Agency 

Region 5 EPA has offered assistance with Public Information distribution during the emergency. 

Outside Help is still needed... 

The City of Flint is forever thankful to our community partners who have given so much to help so many 
people. However the magnitude of this emergency calls for more resources that are beyond the capacity 
of the combined local organizations and government agencies. Long term solutions will require a heavy 
investment in health care and capital improvement projects to upgrade the city's antiquated water 
distribution system. 

• Help with Immediate Relief in terms of assuring allocative efficiency. Distribution should 
be equitable- assistance from other governments required to assure this. 

• Reaching communities for the distribution of water filters, water, and educational 
materials. 

• Help with Water Testing to increase participation and lead education. 

• Increasing the rate of water testing 

• Assistance is required to fund essential capital improvement projects to guarantee clean 
and safe water.

RE: Per our conversation 

Mayor, 



I believe you are referring to the paragraph in the draft proposal that reads as follows: "To better coordinate resources 
and personnel and react with urgency, Harvey Hollins and MSP Capt. Chris Kelenske have been tasked with creating 
FWIACC, subject to the approval and endorsement by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver." 

That paragraph simply asks if you believe that the creation of the FWIACC would be beneficial to the city. Actions 
addressing the water problems in Flint, through the FWIACC will be taken by various experts/professionals as outlined in 
the organizational chart. 

Transparency is also a critical objective of the Governor, in saying that, we will need your advice on how to optimize that 
objective for the residents in the city. 

Regarding a definite time for your response, why don't you take the next couple of days to really give the proposal a 
more thorough look over, and save your response for your meeting with the Governor. 

If you have any other questions or concerns in the interim, please send them my was as this is still a work in progress. 

Best, 

Harvey

Harvey, 

I received your correspondence, and in reviewing it, my concern is that we only have me, yourself, MSP Capt. Chris 
Kelenske In deciding this important decision about the water problems here in the city of Flint. I would like to have more 
professional input, such as the Task Force that has been put in place. 

In looking at the written plan of action, it seems to be a positive step in the right direction. I also want to make sure the 
transparency of whatever we do is included. 

How soon do you need a definite answer to the proposed plan? 

Thanks

For Immediate Release 


City of Flint to Hold Special Public Presentations on Water Ahead of Planned Switch to 

Flint River as City’s Water Source 


Flint, Michigan -April 15, 2014 — The City of Flint will be holding two separate public presentations on the topic of 
water on Thursday, April 17, 2014. There will be a forum for Flint restaurateurs held at 3:00pm inside Cafe 
Rhema at 432 S. Saginaw Street in which local managers and owners can address any concerns on the river’s 
use. An informational presentation for the general public will then be held at 5:30pm inside the City Council 
Chambers of Flint City Flail. That event will include a panel of City of Flint officials as well as John O’brien 
from the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office and a representative from the Raftelis Financial 
Consulting firm. 

Use of the river, upgrades and maintenance required for the water and sewer infrastructure and the overall cost 
of the system will be addressed in the presentation. Last week, the Raftelis firm presented the findings of a 
water and sewer rate study undertaken at the request of Emergency Manager Darnell Earley to the Flint City 
Council Public Works Committee. 


“The results of the study, along with items related to the use of the river for the period during which the KWA 
pipeline is built, will be included in this comprehensive view of the present and future of the City’s water 
service system and what will be required to maintain its operation long term,” said Emergency Manager Darnell 
Earley. “We have a strategic vision of how to preserve and improve upon that service and plan on sharing it 
with the people of Flint.” Both events come as the City prepares to begin using the Flint River as its primary 
source, which is scheduled to occur sometime after this Thursday.

Conform bacteria detected in localized area of Flint water system 
BOIL YOUR WATER BEFORE USING 

Our water system detected the presence of cotiform, bacteria in the water supply on September 
3, 2014. We routinely monitor for the presence of drinking water contaminants, We took routine 
samples for conform bacteria during on September 2, 201 4 from at! sampling locations 
throughout the: City, The location near Flushing Road and Chevrolet Avenue showed the 
presence of coliform bacteria. We took three repeat samples at this location and at adjacent 
ideations on September 3 and again on September 4, 2014, Two of the three samples on the: 3r<* 
showed the presence of totai coliform bacteria and three of the three samples collected on the 
4th in this same area showed the presence of total coliform bacteria. On September 5 th two of 
three sample showed presence of total coliform bacteria. Updated area of ML King and 
Pasadena On September 4 th one sample showed presence of totai coliform bacteria. On 
September twd. of the three sampies at adjacent iooations showed presence, of total coliform 
bacteria. All other monitoring locations in the City continue to show no presence of Coliform 
bacteria. 


DO NOT DRINK THE WATER WITHOUT BOILING IT FIRST. Bring alLwatef to a boil, let it boil 
for One minute, and let it cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should 
be used for drinking., making ice, brushing teeth, washing dishes, and preparing food. Boiling 
kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. Continue using boiled or bottled water until 
further notice. This boll notice is limited to the ama bordered by Dayton Street (north). DuPont 
Street (east), Flint River lebuihK and LaVetb Rood to Flint . River (west). 

The current boll water notice is being expanded to the north. This boii water notice is; being

What does this mean? 

Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Conforms are bacteria which are 
naturally present in the en vironment and are used as an indicator that other, potentialiy-harmfu!, 
bacteria may he present 

Usually, coliforrns are a sign that there could be a problem with ihe freatment or distribution 
system (pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any s^mpfe, we do follow-up testing to 
see if other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E: coli, are present We did not 
find any of these bacteria in our subsequent testing. If we had, we would have notified you

For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Boil Water Advisory Remains in Effect 
for Previously Identified Area 


Flint, Michigan - September 8, 2014- The City of Flint’s Utilities Department has extended both of the boil water 
advisories from Friday and Saturday for a portion of the city. Friday’s boil water advisory is in effect for the 
area bordered by Dayton Street on the north, DuPont Street on the east, the Flint River on the south, and by 
Lavelle Road (to the Flint River) on the west. Saturday’s boil water advisory also covered the area bordered by 
Stewart Ave. (north), Saginaw (east) Hamilton Ave (south), and Clio Rd (west). This remains a localized issue 
to those portions of the city. 


The Utilities Department believes that due to the low usage and demand of the area, water remains in the system 
for a longer period of time compared to the rest of the city. The City of Flint Utilities Department is increasing 
the chlorine added to water in the area, and to improve water circulation, will continue flushing the system in 
that part of the city. Residents can expect to see open hydrants in the area. The City of Flint will continue to 
aggressively investigate this issue until it has been corrected. 


The Utilities Department has opted to keep the advisory in effect until the results of a citywide sampling taken 
today are known. This advisory is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of drinking water for city 
residents. Residents in the area should continue to boil water or use bottled water for drinking, making ice.

Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Conforms are bacteria 
which are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, 
potentially-harmful, bacteria may be present. Usually, conforms are a sign that there 
could be a problem with the treatment or distribution system (pipes). 

Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if 
other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E. coli, are present. We did 
not find any of these bacteria in our subsequent testing. If we had, we would have 
notified you immediately. However, we are still finding conforms in the drinking water. 

All water testing results at the City of Flint Water Treatment Plant have shown the City’s 
drinking water meets all Safe Water Drinking Standards and this remains a localized 
problem. Testing of the drinking water is a part of the routine process for ensuring the 
quality and safety of the system which happens weekly at ten different sites around the 
city. Anyone with questions about the advisory or any other water issues should call 
810 - 787 - 6537 .

City of Flint Takes a Step Closer to KWA Preparedness with a Crucial Upgrade to the 

Water Treatment Plant 


Flint, Michigan - December 15, 2014 — The City of Flint has this week taken a big step toward the eventual transition 
to use of the Karegnondi Water Authority Pipeline with a much needed upgrade to the City’s Water Treatment 
Plant. A large 36” connection line which will serve as the main feed to the plant from the new pipeline was 
installed over the weekend of December 6, 2014. “This massive undertaking was done without interruption of 
service to customers and ahead of its scheduled completion,” said Department of Public Works Director 
Howard Croft. 


“The installation of the intake section to the water treatment plant represents a key portion of the City of Flint’s 
transition to using the KWA for our water needs,” said Utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson. “Once 
construction on the KWA pipeline reaches Flint, the City will have the necessary connection in place to begin 
receiving and treating Lake Huron water.” Along with other critical upgrades to the plant in the past two years, 
the intake installation brings Flint one step closer to having direct control over all of its water system needs. 
The KWA pipeline is expected to reach Flint by summer of 2016.

Good Morning Director Wyant: 

I wanted to take just a moment to thank you and your team for travelling to Flint Wednesday to meet with me, 
the Mayor, and the Utilities Department staff. 

Everyone on our end appreciated the opportunity to meet directly with you and your key staff at the DEQ. We 
all felt it was a very productive discussion of the many difficult issues facing the City of Flint not only during 
this transition, but as its own long-term, sustainable water supply and distribution system, leading towards full 
implementation of the KWA project. As you know Flint is slated to convert to the KWA water source well 
within the next 18 month timeline. Until that happens however, I think you would agree that we have an 
excellent opportunity here to send a good, positive message about how the City is managing its water services, 
and working very closely with your office in the process. 

As we discussed, an initial media hit from your office fairly soon would also help us build public confidence 
through stronger communication on how we are responding to the challenges we encounter, your department's 
support of our efforts to resolve them, and the resultant potability of the current water source. If there are other 
next steps you need from us regarding such a media release, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

We look forward to our continued partnership in addressing these and other matters critical to environmental 
quality in the City of Flint and the State of Michigan! 

Sincerely,

We have a situation in Flint, Michigan that is beginning to get national attention and could be an opportunity for Home Depot. 18 
months ago, Flint switched its water supply from Detroit Water (the distance and pumping costs of going uphill made it quite 
expensive) to the Flint River as a temporary answer, until they could finish the construction to get their water from Lake Huron 
(Karagondi Water System). The corrosive attributes of the River water have exacerbated the lead deposit leaching into homeowner 
pipes and there is concern around lead poisoning, especially for infants. 

The corporate community is rallying to address the problem. Meijer donated 1500 water filters to low income residents and GM is 
about to announce a donation of between 5,000 and 10,000 filters. I do not yet know where GM is getting the filters from, but I was 
thinking that Home Depot might want to join the effort with a donation, supply chain discounting assistance, or some combination of 
activity that could help Flint residents. Harvey Hollins is our point person for this effort, since he is the Director of Urban Initiatives 
for Governor Snyder. I have copied him here. 

If you could get this into the hands of the right people and see if there is interest in speaking with Harvey, I would be very 
appreciative. Thanks and take care.

I think that Bob Daddow, Rich Baird and Mike Duggan have something to do with the more 
"reasonable" approach. The Mayor in particular is very concerned about the issues of a fellow 
community and Daddow is perhaps the finest public administrator in the state. So, their 
involvement and Rich's management skills are powerful forces.

Dennis - in response to your earlier email; Wayne's guys came up with a ballpark 
estimate for reconnecting to DWSD. Let me emphasize 'ballpark'. They used 
your assumptions & they talked to Natasha H. after 5:00. Bottom 
line... the estimated cost Is approx $10.5 mm to reconnect until June '16. 

These numbers on their surface seem much improved over previous DWSD 
$offers. [Is Daddow in the loop on this ?] We need to give some more thought 
as to whether this is all inclusive, e.g., there might be some costs from turning 
down operations at the plant 


I am being told this can happen in a relatively short time i.e., less than a 
week. Which seems aggressive. Obviously that does not mean the lead 
concerns nor discolored water, etc goes away in a week. The pipe section they 
sold to the county won't be an impediment to this deal. 


l 



There apparently are no 'upfront' costs we need to worry about. In theory, it 
seems like it can be paid over the 9-10 months (vs a lump sum). But I am not 
clear Dennis on those couple ideas/sources the Mayor & Senator mentioned i.e., 
at this point I am not sure where the $10. 5mm comes from. 


My guess is we will keep refining this estimate. Let us know if you need 
anything else. Again, "credit " Wayne's guys for pulling this together quickly.

We are setting up a new revolving fund to enable some borrowing I think. I imagine any deal would require stringent 
terms on monthly payments.

The Mayor in particular is very concerned about the issues of a fellow community and Daddow is perhaps the finest 
public administrator in the state. So, their involvement and Rich's management skills are powerful forces.

Let me emphasize 'ballpark'. They used your assumptions & they talked to Natasha H. after 5:00. Bottom line... the 
estimated cost is approx $10.5mm to reconnect until June '16.

We need to give some more thought as to whether this is all inclusive, e.g., there might be some costs from turning 
down operations at the plant

Here is the letter from the Genesee Co Drain Commission. My interpretation of the contents would be their estimate is

They included their contract with the City. Sec 5.7 references prevailing rates the City would be charged; that is 
different than the rates reflected in the $13. 2mm, So that contract may need to be modified. 


They also raise some other items (under Procedure to Activate Supply ~ p.3) that may have cost implications.

Y'all, 

Without having had an opportunity to review Ken's contribution, I thought I would pass along my initial cut at some thoughts 
on questions / work plan for your review and consideration. I would like to flesh this out further but this may give some idea 
of the questions / approach ideas that arose during my weekend reading sessions. 

As for agenda ideas, a few items — some of which have already been noted: 

• Basecamp orientation (5 min) 

• OMA / FOIA review (already identified) 

• Protocol for addressing issues that may identify potential liabilities 

• Defining how our review differs/complements/ etc the seeming multitude of other reviews 

• Calendar 


Lastly, a couple of clarifications / apologies regarding Basecamp: 

1. By way of apology, I live under the illusion that my home is in Chicago and so my computer is set to Central Standard 
Time. On my calendar, our meeting on Wed. shows up as 10:00 a.m. but I think Basecamp converted it to 11:00 EST 
on your machines. My apologies for the confusion — and thanks to Ken for the correction. 

2. We have set up 2 projects (so far) in Basecamp. The first is just for us — the Flint Water Advisory Task Force (and Rich 
B.). I thought this might be useful if we wanted to be able to have exchanges among the core task force 
membership. The second project, Flint Water Review, includes everyone that was on the earlier distributed roster 
(and their aides). Sorry for any confusion there. 


I will also post the attached to the task force project — and hope to have some further thoughts /revisions tomorrow night. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

- Eric

FLINT WATER ADVISORY TASK FORCE 
AFTER-ACTION REVIEW 

FLINT WATER ADVISORY TASK FORCE 
GOALS - POTENTIAL QUESTIONS - WORK PLAN IDEAS 

Contribution by Eric Rothstein 
Galardi Rothstein Group 


GOAL 


Complete a thorough 
review of all steps taken by 
state and local officials 
regarding the decision to 
switch the City of Flint's 
water source to the Flint 
river from the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage 
Department's system 
{DWSD). 

• Produce a timeline of 
actions 

* Establish why each 
action was taken 


QUESTIONS 


What was the basis of cost 
analysis and what 
independent reviews were 
conducted to validate 
investment? 

Why use of interim supply 
-disconnect from DWSD 
before KWA available? 

How do rules / protocols 
regarding local control 
enable discount of regional 
economies? 

Why were permits granted 
with extensive regional 
over-capacity? 


WORK PLAN 


Review cost analysis 
performed for transfer to 
KWA. 

Conduct interviews / review 
documents supporting / 
approving water withdrawal 
permit and KWA investment. 
Conduct interviews (MDEQ, 
Flint, DWSD, EPA) to 
determine reasons for time 
periods between actions. 
Review qualifications / 
expertise of parties involved 
in decision-making. 


Review the roles of the 
federal, state, and local 
officials in the decision- 
making process 

• Identify best practices 
for federal, state, and 
local officials to work 
together in future 
similar situations 

• Evaluate where 
coordination between 
these entities could 
have been better, and 
how it could be 
improved 


Why was flag not raised 
when GM disconnected? 
Were lessons learned by 
other industry water 
source change problems 
considered? How did 
MDEQ address Paragraph 5 
(c) of its LCR 

Implementation guidance 
regarding changes in water 
source? 

Sequence, timing of 
approvals by City, 
Emergency Manager? 
Explain Miguel del Toral 
communication and 
response? 


Interview Marc Edwards, Va 
Tech and review 
documentation of timeline 
presented in "Commentary: 
MDEQ Mistakes and 
Deception Created the Flint 
Water Crisis" in Flint Water 
Updates and "When did 
state know about lead in 
Flint water? 6 takeaways 
from Snyder plan." * 

Develop more 

comprehensive timeline that 
clarifies timing/efforts of 
City's TAC, MDEQ responses, 

etc. 

Review briefing information 
provided to State / local 
officials. 


1 


FLINT WATER ADVISORY TASK FORCE 
AFTER-ACTION REVIEW 


Review federal, state, and 
local actions and protocols 

• Determine whether the 
proper procedures were 
followed 

• Identify which 
procedures should be 
changed 


Why doesn't LCR speak to 
potential for problems with 
change in water supply? 

Are timelines reasonable 
for circumstances with 
potential for water 
chemistry changes? Why 
does language focus on 
enabling reduced 
monitoring rather than 
focus on high-risk 
situations? 

What precipitated the 
differing statements on 
Flint's CCT? 

What information is 
available on non-water 
based sources of lead 
contamination? What was 
basis for statement that 
elevation of levels was not 
caused by water? 

Is there an inherent conflict 
of interest if the water 
supplier is responsible for 
selecting sampling sites? 


Monitor and review the 
process, procedures, and 
protocols being followed as 
the City of Flint returns to 
the DWSD system 

• Ensure that proper 
corrosion controls and 
testing are in place 

• Highlight the 
appropriate actions that 
the City of Flint should 
follow when the future 
switch is made to the 
Karegnondi Water 
Authority's system 


Obtain Action Plan details 
and review protocol of EPA, 
MDEQ, etc. 

NDWAC review - and 
consideration of lessons 
learned from DC Water, 
other utilities). 


Obtain independent 
estimates of costs for CCT. 
(Cornwell of NDWAC quoted 
as indicating limited cost, 
but phosphates not 
preferred due to other WQ 
effects.) 

Obtain comparison of Ml 
procedures relative to those 
used in other states. 

Obtain documentation of 
GM withdrawal from use of 
Flint WTP produced water 
and responses. Conduct 
related interviews of GM, 
City, MDEQ personnel. 
Interviews / reviews of 
documentation of testing of 
WQand lead levels (e.g., 
testing of Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha showing spike in 
blood-lead levels in Flint 
children).

FLINT WATER ADVISORY TASK FORCE 
AFTER-ACTION REVIEW 


Assess future practices 

• Highlight practices that 
should change for 
communities in similar 
situations 

* Recommend changes in 
law, procedure, or 
practice to ensure all 
Michiganders are 
drinking safe water 


How to promote 
optimization of regional 
excess capacity? 

How to ensure more timely 
response in cases where 
potential problems 
identified? 

What is basis for 2 six- 
month monitoring periods 
(seeming to invite 1 year or 
more of unattended 
problem?) 

Why are high-risk 
populations / sites (e.g., 
schools, hospitals) not 
subject to specific testing in 
standard protocol?

Governor Rick Snyder 
Executive Office of the Governor 
P.O, Box 30013 
Lansing, Michigan 4S9G9 


Governor Snyder: 

I would like to provide you an update with some of the work we are doing in response to your 
letter on October 2, 201 5 letter. I also have three requests of the state that are necessary to 
provide relief to the victims of the Flint water crisis. 

First, Senator Stabenow, Senator Peters and I wrote a letter to the IDS. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EFA) asking for clarification on whether federal Saw penults states to use Safe Drinking 
Water State Revolving Funds (Revolving Funds) to finance the replacement of privately owned 
lead water service lines (attached). The EPA responded that the Revolving Funds can in fact be 
used for this purpose. My office immediately notified both your office and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality of this fact 

Secondly, the three of us also wrote to Secretary Tom Vilsack requesting that the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide greater clarification on the availability of “Ready to 
Feed” formula for recipients of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (W1C) in Flint, Additionally, the letter asks to identify resources to improve the 
nutrition of Flint residents specifically as it relates to lead, because a certain diet can reduce 
some of the impact of exposure. The USDA is currently reviewing the letter. 

Third, 1 have been working with the EPA on important revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule 
that would prevent a public health crisis like the one in Flint from happening again in other 
communities. I will be providing testimony at a meeting of the National Drinking Water 
Advisory Council next Wednesday, November 18 on what we have learned firsthand in Flint and 
the necessary' improvements to the Lead and Copper Rule. 


1 will continue to pursue all of these avenues in order to find assistance for the people of Flint. 
There are, however, additional steps that need to he taken to remediate the damage done to the 
people of Flint due to the failures at the state government level, alongside the forgiveness of 
Flint's Revolving Funds loan debt if that becomes available. I urge state and local partners to 
work in coordination to fulfill the following requests, 

® First 1 request that the state of Michigan use its Revolving Funds and other state 
resources such as the rainy day and general funds to repair the damage done to Flint’s 
water distribution system. 

Due to the corrosive nature of the water, conservative estimates show there has been hundreds of 
millions of dollars of damage done to Flint’s water distribution system. The damage to the 
system will increase maintenance costs resulting in higher rates for Flint water users, who 
already are burdened by the highest water rates in the state. Furthermore, the presence of over 
15,000 lead service lines continues to threaten the quali ty of the water and creates the potential 
for future lead exposure through drinking water. As stated previously, the EPA has said that 
using the Revolving Funds for this purpose is allowed under federal law, and I request the state 
do so. 


® Second, I request the state create a fond for ongoing assistance to the people of Flint to 
respond to the impacts of lead exposure. 

Hie effects of lead are serious arid permanent, with especially harmful impacts on young 
children and those with weakened immune systems. In discussions with health professionals, 
they have expressed the need for significant investments in the local health system in order to 
respond to the widespread exposure of lead to the people of Flint including monitoring of future 
lead exposure. This fund should include support for, at a minimum, continuous health 
monitoring, early education programs, nutrition education, support sendees for children to 
succeed in school, and continued exposure prevention efforts. The investments we make now to 
combat the negative impacts of lead exposure will pay dividends in avoided costs In the future, 

® Finally, I again ask that the state immediately reverse course rad rescind Flint’s 
obligation to provide $2 million for the cost of connecting to the Detroit water system 
and refund any money the city of Flint has had to pay. 

Requiring a financially distressed city and its people to pay tor the state’s failures is an 
abdication of dear responsibility'’ by the state. The state-appointed emergency manager was in 
charge of the city of Flint during the time that the decision to leave the Detroit system was made. 
The state ^ not Flint - created this water crisis, and the state needs to pay to fix it. The $2 million 
Flint spent to reconnect to the Detroit water system could be used for many other essential 
services in Flint, such as hiring policemen and firefighters, improving schools rad maintaining 
parks. 



In addition to state investments, I encourage the state to request assistance from federal agencies. 
They have extensive experience working with health, education and nutrition systems nationwide 
and could provide critical resources to state officials. Specifically, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention has offered resources if the state requests it. 1 will work to support any 
efforts for federal assistance the state makes. 

I look forward to working with the state and federal governments to not only provide clean 
drinking water to the people of Flint immediately, but also repair the damage done to the city’s 
water system and give local health professionals the resources they need to combat die long term 
impacts of lead exposure.

Dan Kildce

Thus far we have heard nothing reference to Flint putting an emergency declaration in place. Below is a link to 
a show called Current State. The new mayor mentions they need a disaster declaration.

Per my text 

Excerpt... 



One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the absence of a larger 
framework which measures results and the impact of these efforts. We believe this larger framework should address the 
following: 

1. The need for MDHHS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in collaboration 
with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for contingency plans for the 
state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups regarding action 
steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— independent of any one particular state agency— be 
established to provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. 
For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports on the goals, timelines and 
assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health providers, and state agencies to know 
about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as well as promote coordination and accountability. The 
Task Force is prepared to assist in the development of that dashboard. 

We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in communication on this 
issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance 
of our final report, we would like to ensure the independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community 
groups to begin rebuilding community trust in state actions.

Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with several members of 
the Michigan Department of Hea Ith and Fluman Services (MDHFIS) to discuss elements of the 10-point 
Action Plan designed to address various issues related to the recent occurrence of elevated levels of 
lead in the Flint water supply. This discussion was held at our request as part of our task to make 
recommendations to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing 
mitigation efforts. We also met with staff of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) 
on that same day, but at a separate meeting. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on T uesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force 
participated in a conference call with yourself and several members of the Administration to discuss the 
progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Health Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing, given the potential for disruption of the lining of lead service lines. We will continue to 
assess state jandjocaj efforts and make recommendations regarding specific steps that we believe are 
warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger jaroject coordination framework which measures results and the impact of these 
efforts. We believe Jhe state is best positioned to facilitate this larger framework should address the 
following: 

1. The need for MDHHS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies-to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations.

Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with representatives of 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Michigan Department of Health 
and Fluman Services ( M DH HS) to discuss elements of the 10-point Action Plan designed to address

water supply. These discussions were held at our request as part of our task to make recommendations 
to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing mitigation efforts. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 

Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote public 
health and protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they relate to 
reducing lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is more work that 
must be done to ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health Department, local 
schools, and our partners in the non-profit community. 

These partners are making progress, and we know we can always strive to improve practices and 
communication for continual improvement. 

You make a solid suggestion about establishing a person who is independent of any one of the involved state 
agencies or organizations to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am recommending that 
Harvey Hollins, director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the 
issue and the challenges faced by our cities and will be effective in this role. He will be assisted by senior 
members of our executive team to ensure you will have the continued support and cooperation that you need. 

l 



We also have retained Chris DeWitt, a veteran communications specialist, to strengthen community outreach 
efforts to make sure residents have access to the information they need. 

I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more accessible 
to the Flint community. These are critical measures that can be used as we look the challenges and progress in 
Flint, but also can be a part of efforts moving forward in other areas of our state. It’s important that people have 
confidence that we are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to improve 
interaction among city, state and federal agencies. We also will continue to work with the medical community 
to consider how we can work together on wraparound needs of children who might experience health problems. 

People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the water coming 
out of their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - at all levels - is 
working effectively to protect them. 

I thank you again for investing your time and expertise to this vitally important effort. 

Regards,

agencies to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing work. I am recommending that Harvey Hollins, 
director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the issues and the 
challenges faced by our cities and will be effective in this role. Senior members of our executive team will 
continue to engage with your task force and provide direction and support to Harvey to ensure you will have 
continued support and cooperation. We also have retained Chris DeWitt, a veteran communications specialist, 
to strengthen community outreach efforts to make sure residents have access to the information they need. 


I also support your suggestion of a dashboard to make information about our work and progress more accessible 
to the Flint community. These are critical measures that can be used as we look the challenges and progress in 
Flint, but also can be a part of efforts moving forward in other areas of our state. It’s important that people have 
confidence that we are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to improve 
interaction among city, state and federal agencies. We also will continue to work with the medical community 
to consider how we can work together on wraparound needs of children who might experience health problems. 

People in Flint and across our state deserve safe, clean water. I want them to be confident that the water coming 
out of their tap is safe for their families. And I want them to trust that their government - at all levels - is 
working effectively to protect them. 


I thank you again for investing your time and expertise in this vitally important effort.

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Members, 


Thank you for your correspondence on Dec. 7, and, most importantly, for your hard work to promote 
public health and protect our residents as we move forward. Your efforts are both respected and 
appreciated. 

As acknowledged in your letter, we have taken many steps to address the challenges in Flint as they 
relate to reducing lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since October, and recognize there is 
more work that must be done to ensure that this progress continues. 

At the state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Michigan Departments of 
Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Genesee County Health 
Department, local schools, and our partners in the non-profit community. 

These partners are making progress, and we know we must always strive to improve practices and 
communication for continual improvement.

Virginia Tech Researcher Claims Stonewalling On Lead Data 

The Department of Health and Human Services had data that showed there were elevated lead levels in Flint's 
water, but delayed in releasing that data to others for review, Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards said in an 
article posted to his website documenting the city's water crisis. 

Department officials agreed and said the experience led to changes in how they examine data. 

Mr. Edwards said the department had data from shortly after Flint changed its water source that showed a spike 
in blood lead levels in children in two at-risk neighborhoods, but did not disclose that data until September 
2015. 

"They discovered scientifically conclusive evidence of an anomalous increase in childhood lead poisoning in 
summer 2014 immediately after the switch in water sources, but stood by silently as Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) officials repeatedly and falsely stated that no spike in blood lead levels (BLL) 
of children had occurred," he said in the post. 

DHHS spokesperson Jennifer Eisner agreed the department had data that showed the spike, but said its analysis 
at the time overlooked factors that, in retrospect, would have shown there was a water quality problem. 

"When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase appeared to 
be consistent with the seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months," Ms. Eisner said, "ft wasn't until the 
Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by ZIP code, controlling 
for seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result of this process, we have 
determined that the way we analyze data collected needs to be thoroughly reviewed." 

Mr. Edwards said DITHS officials also stonewalled him on getting access to that data. 

He said data he had gotten easily in 2006 documents for a similar review took several weeks to receive after his 
request sent September 2. When he did finally receive the data, he said it was a version that omitted the lead 
level spike from summer 2014 that the department had created in July. 


l 



He said a series of emails he received under a recent Freedom of Information Act request showed and intention 
by DHHS officials to keep the reports from the public. 

"Our FOIA reveals a shocking DHHS graph created in October 2015. It shows the statistically significant spike 
in blood lead that occurred in summer 2014 - the scientific result that DHHS has never publicly acknowledged," 
Mr. Edwards said in his post. 

Ms. Eisner said the department has worked to make the data available. "Summary reports outlining blood lead 
level testing are posted online on a bi-weekly basis, and we work closely with local partners to fulfill data 
requests as we receive them," she said.

Subject: RE: Edwards Report Response 


The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has consistently provided information 
regarding blood lead levels in the city of Flint. 

When initially looking at the citywide and county elevated blood lead level numbers, the increase 
appeared to be consistent with the routine seasonal fluctuation seen in the summer months. It wasn't 
until the Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a more in-depth look at the data by ZIP 
code, controlling for seasonal variation, and confirmed an increase outside of normal trends. As a result 
of this process, we have determined that the way we analyze data needs to be thoroughly reviewed. 
Additionally, Gov. Rick Snyder has created a Flint Water Task Force to review all city, state and federal 
responses and actions and is expected to make recommendations moving forward. 

Our department is focused on ensuring that appropriate case management and follow up is occurring in 
Flint. Summary reports outlining blood lead level testing are posted online on a bi-weekly basis, and we 
are working closely with local partners to fulfill data requests as we receive them. 

Regarding the FOIA, Mr. Edwards received all of the requested documents, with personal information 
redacted, on Friday, December 18.

Outline of Role and Responsibility— Harvey Hollins 

Flint After Action Task Force and Local/County/State Coordination 

Key Activities Draft 


I. Confirm key stakeholders that should convene on a regular basis to do the following: 

a. Identify resources and support required to manage continued testing, cognitive 
assessment, updates on progress, impediments, community outreach, etc. 

b. Assess delivery of resources protocols and adjust (door to door, neighborhood centers, 
etc.) 

c. Agree a communications strategy within the stakeholder community and aggressively 
inform the residents of Flint of resources available and consequences of inaction. 

II. Create a short/medium and long term plan to capture roles and responsibilities at the local, 
county, state (and federal if appropriate) levels which will be reviewed and approved by the key 
stakeholder body. 

III. Be responsive to mayor, media, residents and all stakeholders about what currently is being 
done and how the way forward is being envisioned and agreed by stakeholder leadership. 

IV. Work to eliminate duplication of effort and ensure that members of the science community 
engaged in assessing and protecting the public health have unfettered access to data, reports, 
etc. and establish a mutually agreeable process to surface and resolve conflicting interpretations 
of data when it occurs. 

V. Coordinate with State departments (DHHS, DEQ, Executive Office) to secure funding needed and 
subject matter resources to ensure long term monitoring and remediation efforts. 

VI. Ensure that the recommendations of the After Action Task Force are executed. 

VII. Provide weekly status updates to Governor Snyder and members of his team charged with 
supporting the Chief Coordinator. 

VIII. Determine how what is being done in Flint is relevant to other communities and needs to be 
shared as part of a state wide strategy. This may also impact future policy development to 
address long term infrastructure remediation.

Mike and I discussed the way forward and he had various conversations with PwC, Bernard and the steering group. ! 
also spoke with Bernard last week. I suggest that you and he and 3 have a discussion about where we are. I wiii ask 
Virginia to arrange it. ! brought you and Bernard into this mix because i think there is value in reconciling both 
approaches. I think that having consistency of language, look and feel at the top of each agency strategy and with the 
Governor's Strategic Objectives is optimal. ! do not think we need millions in consulting fees to get there and I want

Gents, 

It has occurred to me for some time that perhaps, rather than DOC, our next Agencies might be DEQ followed by DNR. if 
they can't test water, who knows what else is lurking in the weeds? I suspect your report back on DEQ might have 
indicated as much. 

I also trust by now that PwC has been told that Bernard's project is coming to an end. Will that make them a bit more 
receptive to my win/win, or are they going to keep pushing Bernard? Speaking of which, we need a little organization to 
the MDARD pilot program. I suggested it to cause PwC/Bernard to put their cards on the table. Just what is it exactly 
they propose and how wiii it produce a more cost effective result than OpEx? Whatever it is, they should be obligated 
to put it on paper. 

Now, i suggest that we have a meeting to get the rules straight. It might he appropriate for Mike to chair it. I assume he 
is the point guy on resolution, it wiii also keep PwC honest. I don't want to waste all this knowledge Mike is acquiring. 

Finally, I would be interested in what Jamie, Gordon, and Ken think about this. At the last Bernard meeting, I asked each 
of them to consider where we would have been had we followed the Bernard methodology ail the way into MDARD 
compared with where we are now. Without hesitation, they all responded separately that it would have been the same 
place. I rest my case. 

It would be interesting to ask Nick/Sally and David/Brom the same question. Something tells me I know the answer. 


Finally, if Bernard's project is going to yield real results, it needs to provide the Agency level objectives that the plan 
envisions. I suspect Bernard will avoid that arguing that it can't be done until the Agencies are "mapped." Again, our 


l 



results indicate that such is not the case. If he does not do so, then we will do it as part of Op Ex. As 1 noted, that is what 
we are doing now. DEQ. is responsible for protecting us and the environment. That is their objective. How they do it to 
a much enhanced level of consistent excellence is what GpEx Is all about. No mystery. 

I'll be in Lansing next week from about 4 on Monday through Thursday. Friday will find me at 6RHV. Mike, perhaps we 
could find time for a quick chat. 

Happy New Year. I am looking forward to a very productive year. You have great people. They are fired up and really 
contributing. This is ail about building momentum. We must keep them focused, let them understand what we are 
doing and let them begin to experience victory. That is what is now happening. It can only build. However, we must 
protect or credibility as the naysayers will quickly point to any breach.

levels in Flint drinking water. 


Gov. Rick SNYDER announced Wyant's resignation in a statement today. Also, in the 
statement, the Governor said his administration would invite scientists who have been 
tracking the situation “to be our partners in helping us improve Flint water.” 

“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened,” 
Snyder's statement added. “And I want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn 
from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure.” 

On Wyant, Snyder said Wyant offered his resignation, “and I've determined that it's 
appropriate to accept it.” 

“I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the 
task force,” Snyder's statement said. 

Those other changes haven't been finalized yet, according to Laura BIEHL, a 
spokesperson for the Governor. 

The news of Wyant's resignation comes as a task force continues to work on a report 
about the Flint water crisis, which occurred after the city's water source was switched to 
the Flint River in 2014. 

“Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, members have made me 
aware of some interim findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take 
immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe and 
informed,” Snyder said today. He continued, “We'll continue to work with the community 
members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns.” 

Snyder also noted the he called Flint Mayor Karen WEAVER last week and the two are 
going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

Wyant has been MDEQ director since Snyder took office in 201 1 . 

Previously, Wyant was the director of the Department of Agriculture under former Govs. 
John ENGLER and Jennifer GRANHOLM.

Background 

■ The quality of Flint water has been a high-profile concern in recent weeks, with residents complaining about the 
color, taste and smell of tap water since a switch to Flint River water as a temporary source as a pipeline is built 
to Lake Huron as a water source starting in 2016. 

o Residents have attended meetings with jugs of brownish water, 
o U.S. Kildee has worked with labor and community groups to distribute bottled water. 

■ Mayor Walling has issued a letter (included below) calling for state and federal assistance for the city, including 
forgiveness of some $20 million in debt through the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund and calling for the 
governor to come to Flint personally. 

o Walling also submitted a guest column to the Flint Journal with similar requests. 

■ He said the loan forgiveness is needed for the city to upgrade its water treatment process. 

o Governor and Mayor Walling had a telephone conversation on Friday, and the mayor has pledged to 
work together on solutions. 

■ Rep. Sheldon Neeley also has sent the governor a letter, saying that his constituents "are on the verge of civil 
unrest." 

■ The Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the water situation, with a detailed 
backgrounder and talking points attached below. 

■ The Treasury Department is announcing Tuesday that Flint is among the cities receiving a combined $8 million 
the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages and Townships grant program. 

o The announcement of the other grants will follow the Flint announcement. 

■ The Flint grants are $1.1 million to allow the city to replace the functions of the old incinerator 
with new water pollution control facility allowing for the disposal of waste to landfills. 

■ The other is $900,000 to allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection survey, 
which will lead to prioritizing repairs. 

o A breakdown of the grants is included below. 

Treasury breakdown of Flint grants 

Flint Incinerator: The grant project entails shutting down the current Water Pollution Control Facility Incinerator (due to 
the incinerator not being up to new EPA standards). In order to meet EPA standards, it would cost roughly $8.8M in 
upgrades to the current incinerator. The grant funding will allow them to replace the functions of the old incinerator by 
constructing new facilities which will allow for the disposal of waste to landfills. 

Budget Breakdown 

Construction Contractor $1,050,000 

Project Management $50,000 

Total $1,100,000 

Flint Leak Detection: The grant project will allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection survey of the 
city water lines. The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak severity. This data will allow the 
city to prioritize leak repair. The project also covers the expense of conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition 
assessment on a portion of the city's pipes. The assessment will guide the city's water main replacement program.

, backgrounder on Flint water 


Following the formal approval of Flint into the KWA in 2012, DWSD sent Flint a letter saying their contract was thereby 
terminated (by early 2013). 

Genesee County has been using DWSD water without a contract since May 2014. But Flint took the letter to imply a 
water cutoff, and promptly turned to DEQ with a proposal to use the Flint River (their historic backup system). 

This proposed shift was pitched primarily as a money saver. But it put the city in the business of water production, 
where they historically had been in the business of water transmission. DEQ approved the use of the river as a source, 
based on the treatment plant's past performance as a standby facility and the improvements we outlined prior to a 
switchover. 

Several municipalities around the state use surface water supplies (rivers): Blissfield near Monroe, Manistique, and Alma 
to name a few. 


The city completed the upgrades at the water plant the facility and DEQ approved it April 2014. 

There were some initial hiccups. Last summer, there were a couple of 'boil water' notices issued. One for a water test 
that showed e. coli, one for a break in the water main. 

The challenge to using the Flint River as a source is that the condition of the water is variable and changes with season 
and weather. It has substantially more organic matter than deep lake sources like Lake Huron. This organic matter is 
mobilized by high water events, and warm weather also can account for more organic material in the water. 

The treatment of the organic matter is done with chlorine. One might conclude that the continual answer is just to use 
more chlorine to achieve water safety. However, at some point on the continuum, the chlorine and organic matter 
create TTHM - total trihalomethanes - as a byproduct. When the standard for those is exceeded over several 
consecutive quarters of testing, the supply is required by law to issue public notice and submit an approved plan for 
addressing the situation. 

You'll note that this regulatory approach means TTHM testing is done quarterly. That means people who use the system 
are exposed to TTHM for several months before the public notice is required. It's because TTHM is a chronic health 
threat. Over the long term (measured in decades), continued exposure can contribute to some known health problems. 
If this were an immediate health threat, customers would receive immediate notification to boil their water or not use 
it. 

Put in context, the EPA (which established the standard and the rule) estimates the existence of the TTHM standard 
prevents an estimated 280 bladder cancer cases each year ... out of more than 330 million people who use public water 
supplies around the country. 

It's not "nothing." State and federal law requires quarterly testing for TTHM and that the public be informed of it when 
the annual average of four quarters' worth of consecutive testing shows TTHM levels exceeding 80 parts per billion. 
Flint's results managed to exceed the annual average in three quarters, and they must develop a plan to address it. 

But it's not like an eminent threat to public health. Unlike an e. Coli or even total coliform bacteria maximum 
contaminant level, which require immediate public notification and response and are part of daily / hourly testing of 
public water supplies, TTHMs pose a public health concern with chronic, long-term exposure. 


3 



It's clear the nature of the threat was communicated poorly. It's also clear that folks in Flint are concerned about other 
aspects of their water - taste, smell and color being among the top complaints. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires public water supplies be tested for more than 90 regulated contaminants, 
including microbial contaminants. The act, and the program here in Michigan, work to ensure that water is safe to drink. 
The act does not regulate aesthetic values of water. Here are some factors affecting the aesthetics of water in Flint. 

1. It's the Flint River. The water supplied by DWSD historically came from Lake Huron. It's softer. With hard water, 
you get a different flavor and feel. It's why General Motors suspended use of Flint Water - it was rusting their 
parts. Also, there's the 'organics' factor (discussed previously). 

2. The system is old. Flint has more than 500 miles of water pipes. More than half of those pipe miles are more 
than 75 years old. Much of it is cast iron. Hard water can react with cast iron and exacerbates the rusty factor, 
which creates that brown water that angry residents were holding up in jugs for the media cameras last week. 
Valve failure has also been a key challenge. The system has an estimated 7,500+ valves. When they stick open or 
stick shut, it affects the hydraulics of the system and increase areas of stagnation. The city has a backlog of 
valves that need to be addressed. They've done half a dozen or so since November. 

3. Flint is old. Many of the homes served by the system are old. Brown water complaints may also be attributable 
to cast iron pipes in customers' service connection to the city lines. The DEQ has been encouraging people with 
water coloration concerns to contact the city and see whether it is the service line or the City's line causing the 
issue. Again, discoloration is not an indicator of water quality or water safety, but we recognize that nobody 
likes it. 

In summary, the City of Flint has tremendous need to address its water delivery system. We are not aware that they 
have any capital improvement funds for preventative maintenance in place, much less line replacement project monies 
that will require hundreds of millions. 

The City was approved for a Revolving Fund loan in 2008 or 2009. As a Distressed Community, they qualified for flexible 
terms and 2 percent interest rate Revolving Fund Loan. After they were notified they were approved for the loan, they 
declined it. Previous SRF loans from the state to Flint bear an outstanding balance of $20.7 million today. 

The DEQ continues working with the city to address the TTHM issue. They can take interim steps - from scrubbing the 
insides of transmission lines to carefully monitoring the hydraulic challenges in their system - to address customers' 
aesthetic concerns. Their TTHM numbers already are showing dramatic improvement; the November testing showed 
only one of seven sample points exceeding the standard. 

The key now is that the standard is an average of three quarters' worth of results. It will be some time before they are 
officially "not in violation." However, depending on weather in 2015, it's not unforeseeable that we will be having this 
conversation again by next Christmas. 

The key to the conversation is that TTHM is not a top health concern. That's key because residents need to understand 
TTHM in context, and it is key because it appears the mayor has seized on the public panic (sparked, frankly, by their 
poor communication of the violation notice) to ask the state for loan forgiveness and more money for their 
infrastructure improvement. 

Another key thing to remember is that once the city connects to the new KWA system in 2016, this issue will fade in the 
rearview. 

Key messages: 

1. The DEQ Drinking Water program works with communities around the state to ensure that municipalities 
provide customers with clean, safe drinking water. 

2. Municipal water supplies are tested rigorously and regularly for more than 90 regulated contaminants, including 
microbial contaminants that pose an immediate public health concern. 

3. Flint's exceedance of the TTHM standard should reassure residents that the testing program is effective. 


4 



4. TTHM is not an immediate health threat. It is a chronic concern, one that can be problematic over the course of 
several decades of exposure. The public was notified because the law requires the city to make public 
notification, so that everyone can make informed decisions. This is particularly true for people with infants or 
those with compromised immune systems. 

5. The DEQ is working with the City to address the situation. Recent tests show the TTHM numbers dropping 
rapidly. The department will continue working with the city in the months ahead, and residents should feel 
confident that their water is safe to drink unless the DEQ or City notifies them otherwise. 

6. The discoloration and odor issues some Flint residents are experiencing are separate issues from the TTHM 
issue. TTHM is odorless, colorless and measured in parts per billion. 

7. Flint water customers who have questions or concerns about their water should first contact the city to get 
answers and help. They also can contact the Michigan DEQ. 

Mayor Walling's Facebook post 

Friend, 

Access to clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human right. 

That's why I just sent Gov. Snyder my Flint Water Improvement Plan. It focuses on the areas of safety, quality, access, 
investment and education. My letter urges the governor to quickly implement these ideas so that Flint's water is 100% 
safe. 

Please contact Gov. Snyder by calling (517) 335-6397 (or by clicking here) and ask him to take action immediately to 
implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. 

My plan offers new ideas and also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs at the state and 
federal levels. Here is my plan: 

Safety & Quality 

• 100% Safety is the standard 

• City of Flint releases testing data to assure safety and expands testing to households with support from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 

• Support alternatives for those advised not to drink the water by their doctors through the Michigan Health 
Endowment Fund and community partners to protect the vulnerable like seniors and infants 

• Bring on experienced river water treatment operational management in the City of Flint 

• Require water testing data to be released quarterly by law in all Michigan communities 
Access 

• Announce an amnesty program for turn-ons and reduce the turn-on cost in Flint 

• Develop a revised payment plan policy to allow customers to come back on to the Flint system 

• New Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance Fund for customers 
(modeled on Federal and State energy utility programs: Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; Michigan 
Energy Assistance Program; State Emergency Relief) 

Investment 

• Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital Improvement Plan through Federal 
and State Investments 

• State approves City of Flint's Distressed Cities Fund applications 

• Federal and State forgiveness of payment to Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund 

• Federal and State financing for future improvements 

• City Water Department implements budgeted FY15 projects including leak detection, valve repairs, new pipes 
and meter replacements 

Education 


5 



• Develop a community partnership to provide household and business customers with information on testing 
and conservation 

• Ongoing partnership with Michigan Department of Human Services, United Way, Salvation Army and community 
organizations to provide information on water assistance 

• Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with conservation and efficiency (piloted in summer 2014 
with Northwestern High School students, EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

The struggle with our water has gone on for too long. The state must take action and do its part. Please ask Gov. Snyder 
to take action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint's water is safe. Thank you for your ongoing support.

Harvey, 

If you get a chance I wanted to ask you a few questions about the city of Flint's application to the state to join in the 
creation of the Karegnondi Water Authority linking us to the counties to the east leading to Port Huron. Since we are 
under state management this must be approved by the Treasure, I believe an application or request was sent this week. 
I'm interested to know what stance we're expecting the Treasure's office to have realizing this will directly impact Detroit 
if Flint starts their own water authority.

Flint Water System

Governor, this information was compiled by the Department of Treasury. 

Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, 
Inc. (TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & 
Sewer Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The 
purpose of this study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency 
Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the 
City of Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were 
presented: These options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of 
untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or 
provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and 
Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report 
by TYJT in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA's principal engineering firm regarding the others' 
conclusions and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the Office of Financial Review (OFR) provided a comprehensive report to the State 
Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the 
projections provided by Flint/KWA were acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; 
and 3) Identification of the options Flint will utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay 
in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA 
presented the best future option for future potable water. The OFR also concluded that KWA appeared 
to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee County appeared willing to 
assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA project could signify the 
beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and the KWA project 
had both political and popular support. 

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and 
Flint officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of 


1 




the KWA project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron 
intakes. This bid opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the 
KWA system. The bid was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain 
them as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, 
pending review of any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a "supply only" rate schedule. Only 
water treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and 
operating revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand 
upon DWSD's Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own 
transmission lines. 

The second option was a "full service" rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be 
calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD's final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum 
annual rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 
60 MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given "broadened representation," it is 
unclear exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to 
maintain its WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an 
adequate backup supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total 
cost of this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not 
clear, so analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. 
As such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

PRESS RELEASE: Flint Officially Begins Using River 

Flint.River.Transition.4.25.14.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Officially Begins Using Flint River 
as Temporary Primary Water Source 


Flint, Michigan - April 25, 2014 - For the first time in fifty years, the City of Flint is using the Flint River — part 
of the Saginaw River watershed — as a primary water source for city residents. Today the valve to the pipeline 
from Detroit was closed and the Flint River officially became Flint’s water supply. The temporary switchover is 
scheduled to support the city’s primary water needs for the next two years while construction of the 
forthcoming pipeline from Lake Fluron is completed by Karegnondi Water Authority. Officials from the City of 
Flint, the Genesee County Drain Commission and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality were all 
on hand to witness the historic event. 


The Flint River was once the primary source of water for city residents up to the 1960s. Over the past 40 
years, it has provided water to city residents as a back-up to water provided to us by Detroit. During 
our partnership with Detroit, Flint has had to transition to the use of the Flint River for residential water on a 
few different occasions, with the most recent temporary switchover happening in 2009. Each temporary stint on 
local water proved three things to city employees and residents alike: That a transition to local river water could 
be done seamlessly, and that it was both sensible and safe for us to use our own water as a primary water source 
in Flint. 

Even with a proven track record of providing perfectly good water for Flint, there still remains lingering 
uncertainty about the quality of the water. In an effort to dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint 
River and its viability as a residential water resource, there have been numerous studies and tests conducted on 
its water by several different independent organizations. In addition to what has been found in independent 

l 



studies, it is also the responsibility of the City of Flint Water Service Center to continually test the water 
provided to city residents. Michael Prysby of the Michigan DEQ Office of Drinking Water verified that “the 
quality of the water being put out meets all of our drinking water standards and Flint water is safe to drink.” 


For nearly 10 years Mike Glasgow has worked in the laboratory at the City of Flint Water Service Center. He 
has run countless tests on our drinking water to ensure its safety for public use. Mike has not only conducted 
tests on water provided to us by Detroit, but also on local water from nearby rivers, lakes and streams including 
the Flint River. When asked if over the last decade if he has seen any abnormalities of major concern in the 
water, his response was an emphatic, “No.” In his words, “there has been nothing seen that was of major 
concern,” during his ongoing tenure working in the lab. “The tests results have shown that our water is not only 
safe, but of the high quality that Flint customers have come to expect,” announced DPW Director Howard 
Croft, “we are proud of the end result.” 


Apart from the water plant’s devotion to ensuring that our water is good, Flint is doubly blessed in 
having the Flint River Watershed Coalition as a separate organization dedicated to monitoring the 
overall welfare of local bodies of water, overseeing more than 30 different nearby locations. Rebecca 
Fedewa has been director of the watershed coalition since 2008. By virtue of her passion for her 
work and her position on the board, she is very conversant with the condition of the Flint River. In her words, 
“The Flint River is increasingly healthy, and completely suitable as a drinking water source.” Fedewa and 
FRWC are working closely with the city “to monitor flows and habitats between the intake and the waste water 
treatment plant to ensure there are minimal to no impacts to the overall health of the river.” 


FRWC also invites city residents to be a part of their monitoring exercises during this spring in order “to gain 
firsthand knowledge in the health and vitality of our Flint River.” Mayor Dayne Walling invited everyone at 
today’s event to toast to Flint’s water. “It’s regular, good, pure drinking water, and it’s right in our backyard,” 
said Mayor Walling, “this is the first step in the right direction for Flint, as we take this monumental step 
forward in controlling the future of our community’s most precious resource.”

PRESS RELEASE: Boil Water Advisory Lifted 
Boil Water Advisory Lifted 8.20.14.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


City of Flint Boil Water Advisory has been Lifted, All Testing Indicates Contaminant Free 

Water throughout the City. 


Flint, Michigan - August 20, 2014- The City of Flint’s Utilities Department has received word today from the 
Department of Environmental Quality that the boil water advisory issued for a small portion of the city has been 
lifted. Testing that occurred over the past 24 hours as part of the City’s normal water quality monitoring has 
returned showing no signs of coliform bacteria in any of the sampling areas throughout the city. 


Following the initial positive test result on August 12, resampling was done on August 13th. One sample did 
yield a positive result for fecal coliform bacteria. On August 14, another round of resampling was done and two 
locations tested positive for total coliform bacteria. August 16’s samples resulted in two positive samples for 
total coliform. August 17’s samples resulted in one sample testing positive for total coliforms. Each day 
samples were collected within the boil water area, both upstream and downstream from the initial location. To 
address the total coliform issue the City increased the Chlorine and flushed more fresh water into the 
area. Flushing was to add chlorine to the boil water area. 


Whenever a sample results in a positive for total coliform, a second test is performed for E. coli. No samples 
following the initial fecal coliform positive test have shown any E. coli bacteria. The city of Flint Utilities 
Department in conjunction with the MDEQ worked to investigate possible causes of the positive sample results 
in this area; these could have included water main breaks, loss of pressure, cross connection, unauthorized 
connection to the water system, and sampling error. 


l 



Follow-up testing needed to continue until three days of sampling showed negative results for E. coli. That 
testing concluded with negative results as of yesterday. The DEQ’s advice to continue the boil-water advisory 
was due to an abundance of caution. 


Total coliform is a naturally occurring and generally harmless. Total coliform positive results generate more 
testing, but do not initiate a boil water notice. When total coliform is detected, follow-up tests are conducted to 
determine if the water contained the more problematic E-coli bacteria. DEQ sampling protocols allow for 5% of 
the samples to contain coliform without need for immediate concern or notification. 

All subsequent testing to date has indicated no E-coli. “We’ve gone above and beyond the DEQ sampling 
requirements to verify that the City’s water is safe in all areas. We are working closely with the MDEQ and 
pleased to announce their authorization to lift the Notice. The continuation of the Notice was at the request of 
the DEQ so we could include the normal City wide test results”, said Flint Utilities Director Daugherty 
Johnson. 

Drinking water contamination due to E-coli or coliform bacteria is very rare due to the fact that the bacteria 
cannot survive in the water for very long. The colder temperature 

of water in the system coupled with the regular blending of chlorine into the water makes for a hostile 
environment for these kinds of bacteria. 

Mike Prysby, district engineer for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, said, “The Flint Water 
Treatment Plant has met all applicable drinking water standards during the entire episode including total fecal 
coliform bacteria. This episode was isolated to the distinct section (of the city).” 


Testing of the drinking water is a part of the routine process for ensuring the quality and safety of the system 
which happens weekly at ten different sites around the city. The Flint Water Treatment Plant works diligently 
to provide water of the highest quality to everyone in the city.

Flint, Michigan - August 2Q I 2014 - The City qf Flint's Utilities Department has received 
word today from the Department of Environmental Quality that the boil water advisory 
issued for a small portion of the city has been lifted . Testing that occurred over the past: 
24 hours as part of the: City's normal wafer quality monitoring has returned showing no 
signs of coiiform bacteria in any of the sampling areas throughput the city. 

Following the Initial positive test result on August 1 2 , resampling was done on August 
1 3th. One sample did; yield a positive result for fecal coiiform bacteria. On August 14, 
another round of resampling was done and two locations tested positive for total 
coiiform bacteria.. August 16’s samples resulted in two positive samples for total 
coiiform. August 1 7’s samples resulted in one sample testing positive for total coliforms. 
Each day samples were collected within the boil water area, both upstream and 
downstream from the initial location. To address the total coiiform issue the City 
increased the Chlorine and flushed more fresh water into the area. Flushing was to add 
chlorine to the boil water area.

Whenever a sample results in a positive for total coiiform, a second test is performed for 
E. coll. No samples following the initial fecal conform positive test have shown : any E. 
coll bacteria. The city of Flint Utilities Department in; conjunction with the MDEQ worked 
to investigate possible causes of the positive sample results in this area; these could 
have included water main breaks, loss of pressure, cross connection, unauthorized 
connection to the water system, and sampling error. 

Follow-up testing heeded to continue until three days of sampling showed negative 
results for E. coil. That testing concluded with negative results as of yesterday. The: 
DEG'S advice to continue the boil-water advisory was due to an abundance of caution. 

Total coiiform is a naturally occurring and generally harmless. Total coiiform positive 
results generate more testing, but do not initiate a boll Wafer notice. When total coiiform 
Is deteded, foiiow-up tests are conducted to determine if the wafer contained the more 
problematic E-coii bacteria. DEG sampling protocols allow for 5% of the samples to 
contain coiiform without need for immediate concern or notification. 

Alt Subsequent testing to date has indicated no E-coli. "We’ve gone above and beyond 
the DEQ sampling requirements to verify that the City’s water is safe In all areas. We 
are working closely with the MDEG and pleased to announce their authorization to lift 
the Notice. The continuation of the Notice was at the request of the DEG so we could

Mr. Earley, 

The Public Works committee meeting ran a little long and I had a late start on this but was able to complete a 
bullet point overview of the boil water advisory. One copy is in white paper format and the other is an official 
memorandum. I tried to condense this into a comprehensive overview that focused on the main aspects. 

I can add further details if this is not sufficient. 


Thank you,

MEMORANDUM 

TO: Darnell Earley, Emergency Manager 

FROM: Howard Croft, Public Works Director 

DATE: September 16, 2014 

RE: Recent Boil Water Advisory 


Mr. Earley, 

I have compiled a bullet point list of the pertinent events surrounding the recent boil 
water advisory in the City of Flint. I have separated the events into five categories and 
attempted to condense them into a comprehensive sequence for your review. 


OVERVIEW 

o On Friday September 5 th the City of Flint issued a boil water advisory to 
residents in two of ten test areas around the city, 
o The advisory was due to multiple positive tests for “total coliform” and the area 
covered approximately 9 square miles. 

° On Sunday September 7 th the City expanded the advisory to include another of 
the ten test areas due to a subsequent positive test, 
o The boil water advisories were lifted on Tuesday September 9 th at 5:00 after 
consultation with the DEQ.

BACKGROUND 


■ State of Michigan Regulations requires that the City of Flint Water Treatment 
Plant perform testing of its water distribution system on a routine basis in ten 
different locations around the City. 

■ The tests take twenty four hours to produce valid results and are sent directly to 
the Department of Environmental Quality for review. 

■ Test results which show positive for “Ecoli” or “fecal coliform” trigger boil water 
notices for the test area and the advisories usually remain in effect until three 
consecutive tests return negative results. 

■ A single positive test for “total coliform” does not generally result in a boil water 
advisory, rather it indicates that the environment is conducive for bacteria. 

■ Typically, investigation into possible causes followed by corrective measures 
such as flushing the affected area with open hydrants will cleanse the system. 

■ This process is overseen by an employee who is required to hold an F-1 State 
License and is listed as the Operator in Charge of the Water Plant and an 
employee who holds an S-1 State License which is required to maintain 
distribution systems of this municipal size. 

■ The City of Flint has over 500 miles of pipe in its distribution system, much of 
which is over 70 years old. 

■ The City of Flint has over ten-thousand valves throughout its distribution system. 

■ The City of Flint has a professional reliability study of its system, that was 
updated in December 2013. 


PROBLEM 

❖ After detecting the initial positive test for total coliform, normal procedures did not 
clear the condition and multiple positive tests ensued. 

❖ The continued positive total coliform tests were the cause for issuing the boil 
water notice. 

❖ Additional discoveries showed that residual chlorine levels in the affected area 
were considerably lower than normal. 


* CITY HALL. 1101 S. SAGINAW STREET. RMS105. FLINT. MICHIGAN 48502 fSlOi 766-7135 Fax (81 0) 766-7249 * 


SOLUTION 

■S On Monday September 8 th the City convened all licensed personnel, Utility 
Supervisors, and DPW Director to a single meeting location and held a 
brainstorming session with the DEQ on conference call. 

S It was agreed that while not totally isolated, the concern was mainly present in a 
specific large transmission line that ran through all positive testing areas. 

■S It was determined to expand the hydrant flushing outside of the immediate 
impact area. 

•S It was found that a 24” valve which feeds this transition main was broken in the 
OFF position outside of the immediate impact area. 

S The broken valve was preventing fresh water from being pushed directly into the 
impacted area while causing water to travel from the water plant around the 
entire city and preventing adequate circulation of fresh water. 

■S In repairing the broken valve, virtually all of the symptoms were erased over a 24 
hour period and the chlorine count has steadily risen back to normal levels 
throughout the transmission main. 


CONCLUSION 

S The City was in direct contact with DEQ personnel daily. 

S The positive tests were for “total coliform” only. 

S The following statement about total coliform was approved by the DEQ and 
made in writing to the public as part of the recent boil water. 

Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Coliforms are bacteria 
which are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that 
other, potentially-harmful, bacteria may be present. 

Usually, coliforms are a sign that there could be a problem with the treatment or 
distribution system (pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we 
do follow-up testing to see if other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coliform 
or E. coli, are present. We did not find any of these bacteria in our subsequent testing. 
If we had, we would have notified you immediately. However, we are still finding 
coliforms in the drinking water. 

•S The City of Flint is in the first year of strategic budgetary investment in an 
infrastructure strategy. 

•S The City of Flint infrastructure strategy has been, and will continue to be 
developed with state licensed employees, industry experts, and proven 
experienced consultants.

PRESS RELEASE: Fall Hydrant Flushing 
Fall.Hydrant.Flushing.9.25.14.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


Fire Hydrant Flushing Scheduled to Occur in Areas of the City of Flint Beginning Friday, 

September 26, 2014 


Flint, Michigan - September 25, 2014- The City of Flint’s Water Service Center will be doing fire hydrant flushing 
throughout the city beginning on Friday, September 26, 2014 that will continue throughout the weekend. The 
hydrant flushing is a part of regular maintenance designed to enhance the circulation of water in the system and 
a part of the city’s effort to provide high quality water to its residents and businesses. This activity is expected 
to continue throughout the Fall in various parts of the City and will have no effect on water usage by residents 
and businesses. 


Residents in the areas where flushing is taking place should expect to see activity by City crews and signs 
marking open hydrants. "There will be ongoing hydrant flushing as needed and all hydrants in the city will be 
flushed within the next several weeks,” said Utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson. “If you see a hydrant 
with a barricade on it we are aware of it running and its part of the normal safe operation of a large municipal 
drinking water system. " 


Water distribution systems commonly flush hydrants in an effort to reduce retention times within the system. 
This coupled with constant sampling ensures high quality water to the customer and helps to avoid any future 
boil water notices. The flushing going on currently is reactionary to water plant chlorine residual testing and is 
very dynamic as the chlorine residuals change at different rates. 


l 



“Hydrant flushing is a necessary display of proper system maintenance/operation and should be looked upon 
favorably by everyone,” said Robert Bincsik, City of Flint Water Distribution and Sewer Maintenance 
Supervisor. “After all, hydrants are one of the only visible parts of a water distribution system and serve as a 
way to visually monitor the system.”

PRESS RELEASE: Water Main & System Repairs 

Water Map 10.15.2014.pdf; Water Main Repairs 10.15.14.pdf 


MEDIA AVAILABILITY FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WILL BE 9:00AM, 
THURSDAY OCTOBER 16, 2014. PLEASE CONTACT THIS OFFICE TO CONFIRM. 


For Immediate Release 


Major Water Line Repairs Will Take Place in Robert T. Longway Blvd & Dort Hwy. 

Area, More Repairs to System Scheduled 


Flint, Michigan - October 15, 2014- The City of Flint’s Department of Public Works is working to repair a water 
main break in the area of Dort and Longway. That repair will be followed by more scheduled repairs to the 
system in the area which will begin on Saturday, October 1 8, 2014 and which should be completed by evening 
Sunday, October 19. The work being performed will result in improved operational control over a large 
transmission line running down Dort Hwy. which will include improving chlorine residuals in the southern 
portion of Flint. No residential customers are connected to this line; however, there will be a reduction of 
pressure to the system, which may cause low water pressure in the surrounding area. 


In accordance with DEQ regulations the City of Flint will be issuing a Boil Water Advisory for the area (see 
attached map) ONLY if residents lose water service during this 24 hour period. Residents who lose water 
service during that time should expect to use boiled water for 24 hours after service is restored based on 
testing. If residents in the area do not experience a loss of water service, then there is no need to boil 
water. Any residents who do experience a loss of water should call the Water Service Center at 810-766-7202 
between 8:00am and 4:00pm on Saturday to report the issue. 


l 



A Boil Water Advisory is restricted to drinking water and un-boiled water used for cooking. Once again, this is 
merely a precaution as no one in the affected area should be directly connected to the portion of the system 
being repaired. Low pressure and discoloration may occur for those in the area, but this is no cause for 
concern. The City of Flint asks that residents watch their local news station for announcement of the 
completion of repairs. 


A break in the sixteen inch water main was discovered a week ago and crews have since been examining the 
surrounding system. As a result of that examination, a number of valves in the area were identified as “long 
overdue” for replacement. “The valves we are replacing in this area have needed attention for quite some time,” 
said Flint Utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson, “the fact that we now have the resources and planning to 
perform this work is a tremendous benefit for the entire City.” 


All of the scheduled work taking place is part of an ongoing, broader plan to examine different sections of the 
water system citywide for needed repairs and upgrades. Upgrading critical infrastructure such as the water 
system is a key part of the City’s Strategic Plan, which is directly guided by the Master Plan, and part of the 
City’s commitment to deliver the highest quality water possible.

PRESS RELEASE: Statement on GM Water Agreement 

GM.Water.Agreement.Statement.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


Water Issues for General Motors are Not Issues for Residents 


Flint, Michigan - October 16, 2014 ~ The City of Flint is committed to ensuring that all Flint residents have safe 
quality drinking water. That is why we recently reached an agreement with General Motors to allow the 
company to temporarily use Flint Township as a water source for their manufacturing needs. 


The City of Flint uses chloride as an important component in making water safe for drinking, but that can cause 
problems for GM’s machining work. The agreement comes after GM raised concerns about chloride levels in 
Flint’s treated water. 


This temporary switch is needed to allow GM to use water that does not have the same level of treatment 
provided for high quality drinking water. This ensures that Flint residents will continue to have safe quality 
drinking water but minimizes the impact on GM’s machining work. City officials continuously test drinking 
water to ensure quality.

Hi Ron, 



Director Hollins and Pastor Harris did speak yesterday, and they continue to engage in discussions about the Flint water 
issue. Everyone wants Flint residents to have dean, safe water. All parties to the discussions are gathering information 
about a variety of available options. There have been passionate and productive talks, and they will continue.

Dave: 

I just spoke to Pastor Alfred Harris with Concerned Pastors for Social Action. 

He talked about a conference call yesterday with Harvey Hollins, and said Hollins has asked the cities of Flint and Detroit 
for information about the cost of supplying water to Flint. 

I tried to reach Brad Wurfel as a starting point on this but I'm not having any luck. Who should I be talking to at the state 
for information on this? 

Thanks,

PRESS RELEASE: Water Advisory Committee 
Water Advisory Committee Feb.2015.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


City of Flint to Form Water Advisory Committee from Members of the Community to 

Share Updates and Concerns 


Flint, Michigan - February 16, 2015 - In response to the recent concerns regarding water quality in the City of 
Flint, a water advisory committee of 40 citizens consisting of business owners, elected officials and members of 
various community organizations is being formed. The committee’s formation comes after the City hired the 
firm Veolia to provide an analysis of Flint’s water system as well as recommendations on actions to improve 
water quality. The purpose of the committee will be to provide the community with ongoing information on the 
City’s work to maintain a safe water supply and to improve quality. 

In addition to gathering information from the City to share during their interactions with the community, 
committee members will also be expected to share the concerns they receive from the community in order for 
those concerns to be addressed. Mayor Dayne Walling pointed out that the level of connection between the City 
and the community provided by the committee is an important step toward ensuring that the public is engaged 
in this ongoing issue. 

“Members of our community have concerns about the quality of their water, the costs associated with delivering 
it and the problems facing the infrastructure that brings it to them,” said Mayor Walling. “As we worked to 
address each of these areas in turn, keeping our residents, businesses and visitors informed on the progress 
being made and keeping a dialogue open to hear any new concerns is crucial.” 


All meetings by the Water Advisory Committee will be open to the public and will be held at easily accessible 
locations throughout the city. Meetings will be held on a regular basis as work continues at least until the City is 
receiving its water from the Karegnondi Water Authority, which is anticipated to be in 2016. 


l 



The first meeting is anticipated to be during the first week of March, 2015. Letters have been sent to prospective 
members and confirmation is expected to be received by Friday, February 20, 2015. Any group who has not 
received an invitation and who would like to have a member participate can send a request to 

may or @,c i ty offli nt. . com. 

A second, smaller group of experts in various areas surrounding water is also being formed. The Technical 
Advisory Committee will consist of members from the areas of health, government, industry, education and 
scientific research. That group will be announced later this week.

Everybody Is Checking the Safety of Water 


oCity, state, news media, universities and 
other groups 

oSafe = compliance with state and federal 

standards and required testing 

o Latest tests show water is in compliance with 
drinking water standards 

o Monthly report available on web page 

oMore than 20,000 tests required annually 
for city 

o Strict testing requirements in place (what 
and how to test) 





oTTHM is formed as a result of the reaction between chlorine 
and organic material in the water 

o City is required to test quarterly at 8 sites 

o Last summer, several sites had more TTHM than allowed 

oCity has reduced levels of TTHM and now all sites are in 
compliance 

o Customer notification letters are required until tests are in 
compliance an average of four quarters 

o It will take at least 2 more quarters to lower average 

o Even a change to DWSD water doesn’t solve problem 

o Flint is not alone - hundreds of communities are facing 
TTHM issues

o Old cast iron pipes 

o Always has been some 
discolored water problems ■ 
mostly after water breaks 

o Efforts to reducing TTHM 
didn’t help discoloration 

o Doesn’t mean the water is 
unsafe but it is not appealing 
and raises questions 

o City will test the water at 
your home - call 787-6537 
or email 

flintwater@cityofflint.com 

o Tracking customer 
complaints is important

REMEMBER 

We just started. Might not have an answer yet to your question 

o When will water improve - The water has improved with 
current actions. More changes will occur over weeks and 
months because of safety reviews 

o Date of next update and final report - An update will be 
provided next week and a report the following week. 

oTime frame for implementing recommendations - The 

City is already started. Others a few days and some weeks 
or months due to State approval being required or weather. 

o Cost of changes - Don’t know yet but we are aware of the 
financial concerns 


© February 18, 201S Flint Public Works Committee 


19 




o How are TTHM formed - It’s the reaction of chlorine to 
organics (leafs, dirt) in the water. 

o How to reduce TTHM - Reduce organics before introducing 
chlorine and shorten time chlorine has to react with the 
organics 

o What causes discoloration - Older lines, the iron parts of 
the system will leach iron into the water causing the 
discoloration. Other times its just air built up. 

o Why no discoloration with DWSD - There was. Flint had 
a bad time with breaks of old line and is doing lots of 
construction. This stirred up the water and caused 
discoloration. 


Q 




o Can you test my water - The city will test your water for 
free. But, only 2 of 20 people have taken the city up on the 
offer since it began offering the service. 

o Medical problems - Some people may be sensitive to any 
water. Talk to your doctor. The City is communicating with the 
medical community. 

o Confidence that future problems will be avoided - 

Recommendations will include putting programs in place to 
better respond to water changes and assure quality

Mr. Hollins, 

Jerry Ambrose asked me to respond to your request for more information on the Flint water cost analysis chart 
which you sent him yesterday. Please see the attached chart; it contains an added analysis by Jerry. The sections 
for which you asked for data can not be provided as we don't calculate prices in the manner you are comparing. 

Jerry's chart clearly represents what Flint has been talking about - a major increase in water rates would be 
necessary to pay the additional charge to purchase DWSD water.

It would be interesting to back into the numbers that Harvey wants.... but I am assuming you or A1 can break up 
the $149 into fixed and commodity.

Ms. Murphy, 


Thank you. The calculations in the table was provided by treasury and i was seeking clarification, i am not a water 
expert, but I learned that typically, most rates have two components. 


1, Fixed-cost recovery charge 


This charge is based on the size of the water meter at the home or business. Most residential customers will 
have a meter between 5/B th 's of an inch and 1 inch. 


2. Consumption Charge 

This charge is based on the amount of water used. The rate for usage is determined by the distance and 
elevation of the home or business from the water source. 

MCF is used in many place for calculating rates; however, since Flint is currently not using this calculation, what are the 
cost components that make up the $149 avg. monthly charge to the resident? 


Best,

Mr. Hollins, 

Jerry Ambrose asked me to respond to your request for more information on the Flint water cost analysis chart 
which you sent him yesterday. Please see the attached chart; it contains an added analysis by Jerry. The sections 
for which you asked for data can not be provided as we don't calculate prices in the manner you are comparing. 


Jerry's chart clearly represents what Flint has been talking about - a major increase in water rates would be 
necessary to pay the additional charge to purchase DWSD water.

Quick response, subject to verification by Liz Murphy: 

Components of the average charge: 

$ 57.38 fixed-cost recovery charge 
$ 91.63 consumption charge 
$149.01 

Consumption charge based on 7 units of water @$13.09 per unit 
1 unit = 748 gallons of water 

There may be a way to convert a unit into an MCF, but I do not know it.

Today about 98% of water treatment facilities in the U.S. use some form of chlorine to disinfect 
drinking water supplies. It is a cost effective method for destroying potentially harmful bacteria 
and viruses. However, chlorine’s ability to interact with organic compounds in water leads to 
trihalomethanes (THMs) formation. Especially, river or lake water with high level of organic 
matter require heavy chlorination to combat high level of bacteria, resulting in dangerous levels 
of THMs and bad smell. THMs, when ingested can encourage the growth of free radicals that 
can destroy or damage vital cells in the body. Besides cancer, exposure to THMs has been 
linked to other health issues including asthma, eczema, heart disease and higher miscarriage 
and birth defect rates. Further, high level of chlorine also poses serious risk to the aging 
infrastructure. 

Chemical free water disinfection technologies such as UV light and ozone have long been 
recognized to be much safer than chlorination, however, their high cost has prevented wider 
adoption. The basic mechanism of ozone 
generation and disinfection is shown in 
the picture. Ozone has a high oxidation 
potential (much higher than chlorine) and 
a superior response time compared to 
other sanitizing products. Its high 
oxidizing potential enables ozone to break 
down organic matters that chlorine 
cannot. Some pollutants can only be 
oxidized by ozone. For example, Cryptosporidium Parvum, a drinking water pollutant, is 
resistant to most disinfectants, but is effectively destroyed by ozone. Most importantly, the 
emission from ozone is pure oxygen and it leaves no residues. 

UV light is a competing non-chemical sterilization technique. Intense UV rays break down the 
sensitive RNA and/or DNA of microorganisms, thus preventing the organism from reproducing. 
Ozone, on the other hand, oxidizes the microorganisms, thus destroying their cells completely. 
UV sterilization being a line of sight process, to be effective, one needs to remove most of the 
suspended matter prior to the treatment. In contrast, ozone oxidizes the soil or particulate 
matter, changing or destroying the chemistry of the soiling materials such as organic 
compounds. 

Despite the great benefits of ozone, its widespread adoption is limited due to the high total 
ownership cost of current commercial ozone generators. Somnio’s AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator is 
a paradigm shift in ozone generation technology. The first and only commercial barrier less 
ozone generator eliminates the requirement of dielectric barriers and highly filtered dried oxygen 
(pure or enriched) supplies, which restrain current commercial ozone generators. This 
groundbreaking technology brings a market-competitive, robust, energy efficient, and scalable 
modular device that offers a financially attractive alternative with the capability of producing 
varying levels of ozone depending on the application at hand. 

Producing ozone cost effectively is only part of the greater story of the far reaching benefits of 
ozone. Applying ozone effectively for a given application requires careful and intelligent design, 
sensing and monitoring. In addition to its revolutionary AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator, Somnio 


Gas Discharge 



collaborates with end users to provide complete and economical turnkey solutions. Somnio’s 
current in-house test plant incorporates all necessary safety features and automation.

draft announcement - dwrf restructuring 
March 19 announcement.docx 


l 



DRAFT 


For release March 19, 2015 


Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose today authorized a restructuring of four outstanding Drinking Water 
Supply Revenue bonds to allow postponing current principal payments in the total amount of $2.24 
million. This action will allow the $2.24 million budgeted for debt service to be used for expenses 
associated with maintaining safety and improving quality of the Flint water supply. Approval of the 
State Treasurer is required before the restructuring can occur. 

Flint has recently received a final report from Veolia, its water expert advisor, making a series of 
recommendations to maintain and improve the Flint water supply. These recommendations, along with 
other input as well as items identified in the City's current capital improvements plan, will be considered 
as the City develops and implements its action plan to maintain and improve the Flint water supply. 
Discussion on the development of the action plan will begin today at the Water Advisory Committee 
meeting, scheduled to begin at 2:00 pm at the Flint Public Library. 

The State of Michigan was instrumental in allowing the restructuring, as approvals are required by both 
the State Treasurer and the Director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. "At all 
levels, the State of Michigan has been most cooperative in assisting the City of Flint as it addresses the 
many issues confronting the Flint water system", said Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose." Access to 
$2.4 million at this time will be very helpful in implementing our action plan." 

The proposed restructuring will free up funds to enable the City to more quickly move forward on 
recommended improvements to its water treatment and distribution system. Several recommendations 
for improvement are currently unbudgeted, and the $2.4 million will help assure that the most 
important can be implemented. Recommendations to be considered include the addition of a 
Granulated Activated Carbon Filter, estimated at as much as $1.5 million; acceleration of the repair and 
replacement of values, estimated at an additional $120,000 annually; replacement of additional pipeline 
replacement, estimated at $1 million per mile; and acceleration of the project to automate plant 
operations, estimated at $450,000. $1,315 million will become available in the City's current fiscal year, 
and the remaining $925,000 will be available in the next fiscal year. 

The bonds are currently financed at a rate of 2.5%, and postponement of the principal payment will 
incur some additional interest expense over the life of the issue. Interest costs will increase by 
approximately 2% ($228,000) over the 20 year life of the issues.

Subject: Flint Water Advisory Committee Meeting 03-19-15 

Randy, 

Yesterday's meeting was very informational; however, discussion was cut short by understandably upset water 
customers. The main points of information relayed during yesterday's meeting are as follows: 

1. The City provided a table of water improvements* currently that the City is in the process of implementing or 
currently evaluating. 

o The City has built a hydraulic model to assist the City in identifying the locations of bad valves, 
o The City restructured four outstanding Drinking Water Revolving bonds allowing the City to afford an 
additional $2.24M towards Capital Improvements in Water. With $2.24M the City will: 

i. Installing a $1.5M Granulated Activated Carbon Filter (GAC). This will provide the best reduction 
possible and provide better than 90% removal of total organic carbon (TOC), dramatically 
reducing the potential for total trihalomethane (TTHM) formation. This entire project needs to 
be done by early June to assure a flow of water throughout the system. Several months are 
required for the engineering design, State approval, bidding of work, and installation of the GAC. 
According to the Veolia report, this process needs to begin now. 

ii. Accelerate repair and replacement of values, estimated at an additional $120K annually. 


l 




iii. Implement a process control management plan (PCMP) to increase efficiency and 
professionalism by allowing operators on the day shift to communicate with the night shift, 
ensure operators follow the same treatment plan for the water, ensure adjustments are unified 
between all operators, and inform staff as to what the process is when water quality set points 
begin to drift away from its desired quality levels. This will help the City transition to lake water. 
Estimated at $25K annually. 

iv. Automate plant operations to allow the City to monitor activities throughout the entire plant, 
estimated at $450K. 

2. Department of Public Works director Howard Croft provided a breakdown of FY 2015 Water and Sewer 
budgeted expenditures*, and explained 96% of the $70M is needed if the City uses DWSD or river water as its 
source. 

3. Also provided was a document* with answers to all 61 questions asked at the last Water Advisory Committee. 

Suggestions for the City: 

1. The facilitators seemed to have inexperience in mediating or controlling the flow of the meeting. This lead to 
upset outbursts from the public, which stopped any information from being communicated to the public. The 
City may wish to hire professional mediators with experience in facilitating large public meetings. 

2. The agenda did not include time for public comment. This gives the perception that the meeting is "closed off" 
to the opinions of the residents. 

3. It was mentioned by the Mayor, that he City charges an initial cost of $425 to new renters. This fee appears to 
higher than anticipated, and more information should be provided regarding fees and fee structures. 

If additional information is desired, please let me know.

The City of Flint changed water sources, transitioning from Detroit’s system to the Flint River. This change created 
water treatment challenges that have resulted in water quality violations. Aging cast-iron pipe has compounded the 
situation, leading to aesthetic issues including taste, odor and discoloration. Public interest and scrutiny of the 
drinking water system intensified following the distribution of required public notices of violation. 


The City of Flint has made a number of good decisions regarding treatment changes that have improved water 
quality. Flowever, this is a very complex water quality issue and the City is seeking additional advice on what to do to 
ensure healthful drinking water for the community. 


Veolia appreciates the City’s decision to seek independent third parties to review current treatment processes, 
maintenance procedures and actions taken to date, and provide ideas for improvement. We are pleased to present 
this final report to the City of Flint following our experts’ 160 -hour assessment of the water treatment plant, 
distribution system, customer service and communications programs, and capital plans and annual budget. 


This report provides recommendations and a roadmap for improvement, though our engagement was limited in 
scope. Our assessment included reviewing actions taken by the City to date, validating the City’s plans going 
forward, and making recommendations for ideas not being considered. 

Although a review of water quality records for the time period under our study indicates compliance with State and 
Federal water quality regulations, Veolia, as an operator and manager of comparable utilities, recommends a variety 
of actions to address improvements in water quality and related aesthetics including: operational changes and 
improvements; changes in water treatment processes, procedures and chemical dosing; adjustments in how current 
technologies are being used; increased maintenance and capital program activities; increased training; and, an 
enhanced customer communications program. 


We are also providing a recommended schedule and estimated costs for implementing changes. It is our desire to 
help Flint residents and public officials better understand the current situation so that informed decisions can be 
made to ensure safe drinking water for the city’s customers.

To address water quality Issues, the city has made operational changes, sought help from the State, hired 
engineering firm Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN) to provide additional advice, and hired Veolia for an 
assessment from a utility operator’s perspective. The City has also reached out to different specialty vendors 
(chemical suppliers, filter companies and tank aeration companies) for information about products to help with the 
TTHM issues. These are logical steps to take. 


Flint is not alone in dealing with TTHM problems, as many utilities across the country are facing this chaiienge. The 
City appears to be following standard steps that many of those communities are taking to successfully correct the 
problem. 

Although the primary focus of this review was based on solving the TTHM problem, the public has also expressed its 
frustration over discolored and hard water. Those aesthetic issues have understandably increased the level of 
concern about the safety of the water. 

The review of the water quality records during the time of Veolia’s study shows the water to be in compliance with 
State and Federal regulations, and, based on those standards, the water is considered to meet drinking water 
requirements. 

The City has been proactive in its efforts to reach out to the medical community, to set up a phone number and 
email address to receive complaints, to post State Water Quality reports, to provide the list of EPA required water 
tests, and offer to test the water at customers' homes. 

From our review, these numerous efforts demonstrate how the city is trying to be transparent and responsive 
beyond what many other communities might do in similar circumstances.

Water Quality Report 

March 12, 2015 



The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) has requested specific actions be taken related to the 
total trihalornethane (TTHM) issues. The February 2015 report from LAN ( Operations ! Evaluation Report TTHM 
Formation Concern) indicated apparent reasons for the elevated levels of TTHM in the distribution system. These 
generally relate to high Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in the water source, improperly operating equipment both in the 
plant and the distribution system, less-than-optlmai plant TOC removal and old cast-iron pipe in the distribution 
system. Our assessment confirms that these reasons are likely given our on-site laboratory testing and 
analysis, as well as our first-hand observations. 

Due to time constraints, LAN’s report to the Stats was submitted prior to Veolia’s final analysis and 
recommendations, and contained a number of key initial and contingent steps the City should consider, including: 

Initial Actions 

• Hire a Third Party Water Quality Expert to Complete Independent Audit 

• Obtain a THM Analyzer 

• Carry Out Jar Testing 

• Water Plant Optimization Softening 

• Water Plant Optimization Disinfection of Filter Beds (Pre-Chlorination) 

• Water Plant Optimization Polymer Aid to Coagulation and Flocculation 

• Increase Water Main Flushing 

• Water Modeling Cedar Street Pump Recirculation 

• Water Modeling West Side Pump Recirculation 

• Broken Valve Locations 

• Increase Flushing 


Contingent Actions 

• Fix Ozone System 

• Start Feeding Coagulant and Flocculation Polymer 

• Convert to Lime and Soda Ash Softening 

• Change Disinfection to Chloramine or Chlorine Dioxide Temporarily 

• Install Pre-Oxidant at Intake 

• Replace Filter Media Implement Advanced Treatment 

• Increase Main Flushing 

• Continue Valve Replacement 

• Emphasize Cast Iron Pipe Replacement

Veoiia's Reco m m e ndations 


While many of Veoiia’s recommendations match the initial assessment provided by LAN, our approach, as an 
operator and manager of comparable utilities, considers a more comprehensive solution. These improvements 
include operational changes, differences in water treatment regimes and chemical dosing, increased maintenance, 
and increased training. 


• Addition of Permanganate - The addition of a permanganate chemical will help reduce ozone demand as 
well as chlorine demand. The reduction of ozone is needed to help eliminate the possibility of violating the 
bromate limit. The addition of the chemical will require state approval, submission of design documents for 
approval, procurement of the equipment and installation. The State has indicated they will work with the 
City on expediting review and approval of any requested changes. The required dosage of permanganate is 
estimated to range from 0.5 mg/L to 1 .2 mg/L with a corresponding price of $1 60,000 to $320,000 per year. 
(Please note - The water in the river is dynamic which means it will change with weather, seasons and other 
factors. The estimates provided are based on bench testing at a given time and as such require the 
operators to test water and to verify chemical dosages on a frequent basis.) 

• Reduction of Ozone Feed - Treating water is a delicate balance - increasing ozone to fix the TTHM 
problem can raise bromate levels to a point of violation. The introduction of permanganate is being 
recommended to reduce the demand for ozone so that feed rates will not exceed 5 mg/L. The current 
ozone dosing has been as high as 8 mg/L and, as such, if allowed to continue, will increase the risk of 
violating the bromate levels. 

• Increase of Ferric Chloride - Four coagulants were tested by Veolia -ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, 
polyaluminum chloride (PACI) and aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH). Ferric chloride and ACH were found to 
be the best choice of product for effectiveness in removing TOC, a precursor to TTHM formation. Current 
ferric chloride dosages are too low and dosages of 100 mg/L or more are recommended. Again, please 
note, that the amount of chemical needed changes with the nature of the river and as such, water must be 
tested multiple times a day with corresponding changes in chemical dosages. This increase to 100 mg/L is 
twice what is currently being fed and much higher than what had previously been fed last year. The 
increase in chemical costs could be up to $1 ,000,000 per year. This change in dosage (using ferric 
chloride) can be made immediately without state permit review. 

• Reduction of Lime - Lime is currently being overfed. A higher dosage of lime does not necessarily mean 
better treatment. A review of different dosages with jar testing indicates that the current dosage of 280 mg/L 
can be reduced to 230 mg/L. This represents a potential range of savings of up to $270,000 per year. This 
change can be made immediately. It should be noted that the current softening equipment is in poor 
condition, which does complicate the treatment process with a poor balance of flow between the two basins, 
weirs that are not level causing bypassing with the softener basins, and simply old mechanical equipment 
that periodically breaks down. This equipment is not going to be needed when a change to lake water 
occurs. Addition of soda ash to help further reduce hardness in cold weather might require dosages up to 
40 mg/L with an annual chemical cost up to $320,000. There have also been some questions or complaints 
from the public regarding hard water. The water entering the plant is currently 360 mg/L and the plant is 
reducing that level of hardness to about 210 mg/L. Optimization of the dosage can reduce the hardness 


4 




Water Quality Report 

March 12, 2015 


further to about 180 mg/L. This reduction however has been sporadic as equipment breakdowns and high 
flows have caused problems keeping the softening process on-line. As we have noted before, the dosage 
needs to be adjusted daily or more often based on process control monitoring. The raw water hardness in 
the summer is much less than in the winter. For illustration purposes, the difference could be 360 mg/L in 
raw water in winter compared with 220 mg/Lin the summer. 

• Eliminate Pre-Chlorination on the Filters - The reduction of pre-chlorination on the filters during the 
summer months can help reduce TTHM formation. This action has to be considered carefully with 
procedures documented and reviewed for engineering principles. As such, it will take time for the design 
engineer to determine what could be done to assure the proper chlorine contact time and document that 
other safety protocols in water are met. This requires state approval. Any submission should be considered 
along with a possible change in filter media. If Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) is installed then the pre- 
chlorination would be stopped or drastically reduced because of the chlorine impact on the GAC filter media. 
Veolia’s initial investigation into changes in chlorine feed point indicate that the recommended action can be 
accomplished while maintaining the required regulatory contact time for disinfection. 

• Change Filters to Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) - The object of the other changes being made is 
to reduce the TOC before chlorine is added into the process. The plant by design is limited on the amount 
of TOC removal possible. A maximum removal of only 60% is likely if the plant is properly optimized. The 
change of filter media to GAC would provide the best reduction possible and provide better than 90% 
removal dramatically reducing the potential for TTHM formation and thus ensuring compliance with that 
parameter for the water system. The change in filter media; however, is complicated requiring approval by 
the state, design of the changes, procurement of the media and a contractor to install it. That will take time 
and is likely in a range of $1 .5 million (more or less) in cost. The use of GAC also requires more testing and 
monitoring of the media and the TOC than with the current media. GAC will accumulate TOC and begin to 
become in effective after a period of time. Depending upon the level of TOC reaching the filters this could 
be as short as 3 months and as long as 9 months. The amount of TOC is dependent upon the river water 
quality and operation of the other plant processes. Once the ability of the filters to remove TOC is 
diminished, the GAC media has to be replaced if river water continues as a source. The change to lake 
water will not require TOC removal and the media could continue to be used as filter media for that new 
water source. 

• Corrosion Control - The primary focus of this study was to assure compliance with the TTHM limits. That 
is not the only problem facing the city and its customers though. Many people are frustrated and naturally 
concerned by the discoloration of the water with what primarily appears to be iron from the old unlined cast 
iron pipes. The water system could add a polyphosphate to the water as a way to minimize the amount of 
discolored water. Polyphosphate addition will not make discolored water issues go away. The system has 
been experiencing a tremendous number of water line breaks the last two winters. Just last week there 
were more than 14 in one day. Any break, work on broken valves or hydrant flushing will change the flow of 
water and potentially cause temporary discoloration. 

• Eliminate a Storage Tank - The water system has more storage than it requires, due to excess capacity in 
the water lines in combination with the storage tanks. The City has already employed LAN to update the 
hydraulic model. The hydraulic model should be used to help determine if water levels can be lowered 
further and even to remove some storage tanks from service. That decision may need to be made 


5 




Water Quality Report 

March 12, 2015 


seasonally. For example demand during water main breaks last week required extensive amounts of water. 
The excess storage is more a problem with TTHM formation for the system in summer than winter. 

• Prioritize Valve Replacement - The hydraulic model shows long water age in portions of the system that 
appear to be contributing to the TTHM problems. LAN has updated the model to include the location of 
broken valves and that added information is being used to identify other system problems. The City has a 
contract for valve turning and repair work that should be focused on known broken valves, particularly in 
sections of the distribution system with old water age. This activity however must wait until warmer weather 
in fear of causing problems in the water system with lines freezing. 

• Target and Increase Flushing - Flushing the fire hydrants can be useful in cleaning out lines to minimize 
discolored water complaints and also helping reduce the age of water. This DOES NOT mean just opening 
hydrants. The hydraulic model needs to be used to determine which hydrants should be opened and for 
how long to ensure the lines are properly cleaned. For example, this might require 1 5 minutes or even 
several hours of flushing depending on location. The flushing of hydrants also needs to include records of 
hydrant condition, color of water initially and after periodic increments plus chlorine residual testing. All of 
that information will help provide information to the engineers on the effectiveness of the procedure. Each 
crew doing the work should be trained to help explain the process to the public and also warn 
neighborhoods about flushing so that staining of laundry can be avoided. 

• Change to Lake Water - The changes being made now to the water plant will not be the same changes 
required to treat lake water once it becomes available. A thorough analysis and plan needs to be made in 
preparation of that switch. This is going to need to include changes in how the plant is operated, like 
eliminating lime softening and reducing the dosages of many chemicals. Consideration will also have to be 
given to algae treatment when lake water is being used. 

• Operating Programs - All of the changes discussed above are based on testing and techniques proposed 
by engineers and skilled operators of both LAN and Veolia. The staff will need further training and 
implementation of detailed protocols to successfully implement the changes and to ensure long-term 
success at the plant. This means the City needs to implement a series of programs to ensure success in 
these changes. 

o Process Control Management Plan (PCMP) - The amount of testing and resulting changes in 
chemical dosages, along with monitoring the impact on the water, will require a well-documented 
process that all operators follow. An example of this is jar testing, which is used by the operators to 
identify the most effective chemicals and dosages to optimize treatment. The staff understands the 
basic treatment process but needs further practice and training to become proficient in the use of 
routine process control to adjust for water quality. This is commonly referred to as a PCMP and is 
used as a standard operating procedure so that the operators on the day shift can communicate 
with the night shift, that operators are following the same treatment plan for water, that the 
adjustments are unified between different shifts and different people, that a desired water treatment 
quality is defined and variations from it signal alarms and that the staff knows what to do when the 
water quality setpoints begin to drift away from its desired quality levels. 

o Lab QA/QC - The operation of the water plant is dependent upon accurate lab results. Standard 
operating procedure needs to be set and lab technicians trained in that process. EPA and the State 


6 




Water Quality Report 

March 12, 2015 


set procedures and standards to be met and the staff should strive to meet those standards. The 
City has already purchased a TTHM analyzer but should also consider a TOC analyzer that can be 
an online continuous device to provide immediate information on influent and effluent levels of TOC. 
Part of the lab records should be historical review of data to help operators better understand the 
changes they make in the plant. 

o Maintenance Management - The key to water equipment is having all the equipment effectively 
maintained and functioning properly. The current capital program is fixing many broken pieces of 
equipment and updating the plant to current standards. This however must be followed with a 
rigorous maintenance program that ensures the proper preventive maintenance, is able to predict 
when maintenance is needed to keep equipment functioning properly and responsive to changes in 
flows and source water quality. 

o Training - The changes being suggested are new to the staff and as such training needs to be 
provided in what the changes involve, why they are being made, the impact on the water quality, 
and how best to run the plant. A good demonstration of skill level is for the staff to become certified 
by the State as a licensed water plant operator. Many utilities now require all operators to hold at 
least the minimum certification level as a starting point and offer incentives to increase their 
certification level. 

• Communication Program - The city should lay out an immediate, written strategy for communicating with 
the public in the short-term, as well as a 6-to-12 month strategy that contemplates known, future events like 
the KWA pipeline and switch to lake water. A wide range of activities are underway to work with the public 
but a comprehensive and coordinated effort, with a strategic focus, will help the utility and its customers. 

• Dedicated Communications Personnel - The City has a single, dedicated public information 
officer, tasked with providing service to all of city government. The current focus on 
communications support for Public Works, and the anticipated needs over the next several years, 
indicate the city would benefit from the hiring of a staff person in Public Works who could establish a 
communications program designed to provide clear and concise information to a broad audience 
though a number of different channels. In the interim, the city could hire a communications intern, 
local communications firm, or somebody with experience who is able to provide reduced or no-cost 
services for the immediate future. 

• Communications Planning - Public Notification - The City should be congratulated on its efforts 
to keep the public informed. It is posting its monthly reports on the web page to provide 
transparency, though these reports are highly technical - and may be too technical for the customer 
base at large. They are valuable to those customers who do want this level of detail. The city should 
create a single-page dashboard of information that outlines the water utility’s performance for the 
previous month, post the dashboard on the website, print copies for distribution at customer service 
or other reception areas, and be provided during speaking engagements or other events. This 
dashboard should be easy to understand, and include: 

o The number of water quality tests conducted the previous month 

o The number of violations reported 


7 




Water Quality Report 

March 12, 2015 


o Whether these results are in or out of compliance 

o Information about other proactive measures such as main and hydrant replacements, or 
other programs to improve performance of the water utility 

o Benchmarking information so the reader has a greater understanding of how Flint compares 
with other similar utilities in the region and across the country 

• Public Meetings -There should be additional, proactive coordination with neighborhood, 
community and civic groups to provide speakers on timely topics. Given the list of numerous 
responsibilities, the Public Works director cannot do it alone - the city should identify three or four 
other staff members, knowledgeable about the water utility who can also speak to various groups, 
provide information and answer questions. The development of an outreach strategy to target key 
neighborhood, community and civic groups also will advance the communications effort and the 
dissemination of information in both the short and long term. 

• Standard tools - Work crews in the field are often the faces of the utility - the city should create 
standardized tools for communicating with the public that can be easily and quickly delivered to the 
community in the event of main breaks, flushing or pre-planned capital improvements. Tools should 
include: 

o Door hangers for individual distribution 

o Yard signs with simple messaging to be placed near work-sites 

o A simple tri-fold brochure with useful information about the utility and appropriate contact 
information 

o Specific flyers about a range of topics 

o Infographics about how the water system works, from the intake to the customer’s site 

• Change in Billing Format - The City currently has no real way to reach all customers on a regular 
basis and provide information. The city should consider changing from a billing postcard to using an 
envelope and bill stuffer. Monthly or bi-monthly bill inserts are typically used to provide educational 
material for customers and are standard ways to provide information. Understandably, budget 
considerations must be taken into account. 

• Use Public Affairs Programming and Opportunities - The news media has been covering this 
topic quite extensively - there are other media-related opportunities that may reach a wider 
audience. Taking advantage of these opportunities will help the city relay information to its 
customers and the community. 

o Participate in regular editorial-board meetings to provide background information and 
updates on key milestones or events. 

o Identify a local weekly television program and offer to provide guests to speak about key 
milestones or upcoming events.

Conclusions and Next Steps 

The focus of this report is to help assure TT'HM compliance and then improve genera! water quality. The City had 
good results in its most recent TTHM rests, although that is to be expected with the changes made to date and the 
cooler weather which contributes to low TTHM formation. Warm weather will be a different situation both in the 
nature of the Flint River water quality and in the formation of TTHM. With those changes coming, the City needs to 
act quickly to make improvements before additional testing takes place this spring and summer. The summary 
below provides the recommended actions, a priority for their implementation and projected costs either operational 
or capital. The costs are rough orders of magnitude and wii! vary with changes in water quality, operational 
decisions, and engineering choices being made and in some cases require State approval. Although a priority is 
assigned many of these actions can take place simultaneously.

to be adjusted to take into consideration the change in filter media 
both to dispose of the anthracite instead of cleaning and to install the 
GAG. This entire project needs to be done by early July to assure a 
flow of wafer throughout the system. Several months are required for 
the engineering design, State approval, bidding of work and 
installation of GAG and as such needs to begin now.

TTHM notices, Annua! Water Quality Reports and City notices should 
be figured into if any additional costs would exist. Many of these 
changes are underway now by the City.

Notes 

• The costs provided are rough order of magnitude which final engineering will firm up but will fluctuate with final decisions on engineering, 


operating technique and water quality. 

• The change from river to lake water will dramatically cut the chemical costs as less is needed once the change occurs. This means that potassium 
permanganate will likely not be needed, ferric will drop as much as it went up, ozone levels will be lower and little lime will be needed.

The real question is what changes can be expected from these results in lowering the TTHM, improving the 
aesthetics and preparing for the change to lake water. 


• TTHM - The City has already made great strides in reducing the TTHM levels with the changes already 
made. The additional suggestions by Veolia will further reduce TTHM in the water and help get the city 
released from the notices being provided to customers. 

• Hardness - The hardness entering the plant this winter is 360 mg/L with the current system reducing it to 
21 0 mg/L and optimization will reduce to about 1 80 mg/L. During the summer the levels will be lower 
probably in the 140 mg/L to 150 mg/L range. The target set by the current best operating practices is 120 
mg/L to 1 50 mg/L. 

• Discolored Water - The discolored water is caused by the old unlined cast iron pipe. The water from the 
plant can have an impact on discolored water, but a greater concern is the breaks and construction work 
that disrupt the flow of water causing discoloration. A polyphosphate is suggested to help bind the old cast 
iron pipe reducing instances of discolored water. This along with improve flow of water and programmed 
hydrant flushing will help, BUT WILL NOT eliminate discolored water occurrences. 

• Change to Lake Water - The recommendations include the suggestion of programs to help the staff better 
manage the treatment process, additional testing to adjust the plant and additional lab monitoring, a 
maintenance program focused on keeping equipment properly functioning and more training for staff to 
improve their skill level. Those actions will prepare the staff for the change of water sources when it comes 
next year in addition to developing a thorough plan for the switch.

Sorry, some parts should have said "per month", not "per day."

RESIDENTIAL WATER/SEWER RATES - FIXED AND COMMODITY CHARGES 


General statistics indicate that the average person uses between 80 and 100 gallons of water per day, or between 2,400 and 3,000 gallons per 
month. The City's general estimate for the average residential bill is based on consumption of approximately 5,200 gallons per month (7 units * 
745 gallons. So the average we use is not out of line if the average number of users in a residence is around 2. 

At $149 average costs per month, Flint's charges are very high in comparison to other systems, and an issue which must be addressed. 
Unfortunately, the Flint system, which has the capacity to serve a population of more than 200,000, now serves a population of approximately 
100,000. The system, as currently configured today, needs between $65 million and $70 million in revenues annually to operate. One cannot 
simply reduce rates without affecting the ability of the system to operate. 

Like many systems, Flint charges both a fixed charge and a commodity charge to generate revenues. The concept of the fixed charge is that there 
is a certain amount of the utility system which must operate regardless of how much of the commodity is used. Operation and maintenance of 
the system, including building, treatment, and distribution infrastructure, as well as debt service, are examples. 

On the other hand, chemicals, utilities, and staffing to a certain extent vary with the amount of the commodity and can thus be linked to usage. 

In Flint, the total fixed charge for the water and sewer bill accounts for approximately 40% of the average residential users bill. The amounts 
determined to be "fixed charges" were established many years ago, and the water rate study done for the City in 2014 made no 
recommendations for change. 

The Flint system, which more than 10 years ago was very stable financially, had declined into a deficit financial position by June 30, 2012. 
Significant rate increases, many of which were enacted before the State assigned an Emergency Manager in late 2011, were necessary to 
stabilize the financial position of the system. Other decisions, including the decision to partner with Genesee County in the KWA, and the 
decision to utilize the Flint River for an interim period, were made with the goal of stabilizing rates and moderating future increases. Safety, 
quality, and affordability are the key priorities going forward. 

Following is the detail of the water and sewer rate components.

Change in the Financial Position of the Water and Sewer System 


The financial position of the water and sewer system in 2003 was strong. However, by 2011 the financial position had declined to the point 
where the system was in deficit. In spite of increases made prior to the appointment of an Emergency Manager, the utility system was still in a 
deficit position in 2012. While the financial position of the system is now positive, it is still less strong than in 2003:

Water Quality Update 




City of Flint Resident: 

We are pleased to report that City of Flint water is safe and meets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
guidelines. While we continue to work on improving aesthetic qualities, such as discoloration or odor, 
you can be confident that the water provided to you today meets all safety standards. Maintaining 
safety and quality in our water is a top priority of the City. 

We accomplished this by: 

> Upgrading the ozone treatment process at the Water Treatment Plant 

> Increasing water main/hydrant flushing to reduce stagnation 

> Conducting additional testing of treatment to identify areas of improvement 

> Improving water circulation by repairing valves and adjusting reservoir levels 

Our most recent testing in February showed that every testing site was well below allowable levels, as 
shown below:

Notification is based on four quarters of test results. Because of last year's test results, the City's annual 
quarterly testing average is not yet below the state's allowable average and the City is required to issue 
the attached notice ("Important Information about Your Drinking Water"). 



If you have any questions about this report or would like a test done at your home, free 

of charge, please call us at 810-787-6537. 

Maintaining safe water and improving its quality is a top priority for all of us at the City of Flint, and we 
apologize for the concerns these notices have raised. We have taken many steps to improve the safety 
and quality of our water supply and will be taking more. As you may know, we have recently received a 
series of recommendations from several sources, including a report from international urban water 
system consultant, Veolia North America. We will be taking further action steps to assure that water 
remains safe and that water quality is improved, and we will be working with our recently created 
Citizen Advisory Committee and our Technical Advisory Committee as we progress. Please track our 
progress on our website cityofflint.com. 








City of Flint Okl Not Meei-Treainl eat Requirements 

Oiir water system recently violated a dririkin§ : water standard. Although this Incident was notan 
emergency', asour customers, you have a light to know what happ.eried and what we .are doing; to correct, 
this situation.. 

We. routinely monitor for the presence Qfbrihktng water. contaminants; Samples were collected for total 
tdha iomethanes (TtHM) analysis from eight locations on a quarterly basis (May 21 , August 21 f 
November 20 of 2014, and February 171 2015). The average of the results at ANY: of the eight locations 
must not exceed the maximum contaminant level ftVICL} for TTHMs, otherwise our water system exceeds 
the MOL. The standard far TTBMs is 30 micro grams per Iker (dg/t). The location reporting fire highest 
ITHM'tevelws 10,5 ug/L; thus, our water system exceeds the TTHM MCL. 

What should I do? 

* There is nothing you needito do unless you have a severely compromised immune system, have 
an Infant or are elderly. These people may be at increased risk and should seek advice .about, 
drinking -water from their health ears providers. 

* You do not . need to boil your water or take other corrective. actions. If a . situation arises where the 
water is no longer safe to drink, you will be notified within 24 hours. 

What does this mean? 

This is notan emergency, if it had been -ah ; emergency, you would have been.noiififed within 24 hours. 

People who drink water containing irihahmethenee in excess of the MCL over many years may 
experience problems with their fiver, kidneys, or Geatmimwags system, and may have an .increased risk 
of getting cancer. 

What is being done ? 

We are currently working on solutions to correct . the problem. We anticipate cesolv^nig the problem, in 
£015. Our most recent individual sample results were all less than half the SO pg/L, standard, however 
since compliance is calculated using a locational running annual: syetag© (LRAA) of the most recent four 
quarters, we are still out: of compliance with the MOL at two of. eight locations.

SUMMARY REPORT 


TO: Brom Stibitz, Senior Policy Advisor; Department of Treasury 

FROM: Eric Cline. Unit Operations Specialist 

SUBJECT: Flint Water System Summary 

DATE: April 18,2013 


Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc. 
(TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & Sewer 
Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The purpose of this 
study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) 
in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury’ and the City of 
Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were presented: These 
options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron 
Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or provision of variable amounts of 
water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report by TYJT 
in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA’s principal engineering firm regarding the others' conclusions 
and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the OFR provided a comprehensive report to the State Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) 
The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the projections provided by Flint/KWA were 
acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; and 3) Identification of the options Flint will 
utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR 
recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA presented the best future option for future potable water. The 
OFR also concluded that KWA appeared to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee 
County appeared willing to assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA 
project could signify the beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and 
the KWA project had both political and popular support. 

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and Flint 
officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of the KWA 
project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron intakes. This bid 

P.O. BOX 30716 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909 
www.michigan.gov/treasury • (517) 373-3200 



Page 2 


opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the KWA system. The bid 
was $3 -million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain them 
as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, pending review of 
any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a “supply only” rate schedule. Only water 
treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and operating 
revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA’s usage relative to the entire demand upon DWSD’s 
Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own transmission lines. 

The second option was a “full service” rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be calculated 
based upon KWA’s usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD’s final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of Environmental 
Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum annual 
rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 60 
MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given “broadened representation,” it is unclear 
exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to maintain its 
WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an adequate backup 
supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total cost of 
this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not clear, so 
analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. As 
such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

Continuing Challenges: 

• OPEB reductions are subject to a federal lawsuit. Loss of this legal action means an 
additional $5 million annual OPEB expense. 

• Future expense reductions are necessary to balance multi-year projections. 

• The transition to KWA and maintenance of the aging water distribution infrastructure are 
important challenges which require significant funding and continued leadership. 

• The City must reappraise all of the real property in the City prior to the 20 1 8 Assessment 
Roll. This will be a costly, but necessary undertaking. 

Post Emergency Manager Flint 

• It is anticipated that the Governor will appoint a Receivership Transition Advisory Board 
to assist the City as it navigates future challenges. 

• The City has adopted its first Master Plan since the 1 960s. This Plan is sound and will 
provide direction for future years. 

• A new Capital Improvement Plan has been adopted. 

• A new methodology for blight elimination has been implemented, which will improve the 
city and the lives of the residents.

underfunded to a point oPinsolvencyf wiflf pension assets v approximating less than 60% of the 
correlating liability. Unfunded OPEB liabilities exceeded $850 million. These circumstances 
were dire and jeopardized the continued delivery of essential municipal services. 



Four emergency managers have been appointed since the City entered receivership. Great 
progress has been made during these administrations, and the financial condition of the City has 
improved markedly. Changes in the structure of the City have led to more professional and 
responsible management of municipal assets and to reduction of expenses. The new city 
administrator operates with an emergency manager approved plan for increased efficiencies. 
New ordinances have been enacted by the City, ordinances which control the City’s strategic 
plan, balanced multi-year budget, fund balance usage, the establishment of a budget stabilization 
fund, and the purchasing process for the City. Modifications to certain collective bargaining 
agreements have reduced the unfunded OPEB liability, which the City currently calculates to be 
$240 million - less than a third of what it was only four years ago. These collective bargaining 
agreement modifications are contested in a pending federal lawsuit, the loss of which could 
reverse these savings and reinstate the full unfunded OPEB liability. In this event, the City 
calculates that its cost of OPEB will increase by approximately $5 million a year.

These best practices have largely addressed the financial emergency in Flint. Budgets have been 
balanced, and accumulated deficits have shrunken precipitously. The City indicates that the 
accumulated deficit in the Water Fund has been eliminated. The General Fund accumulated 
deficit now has been reduced to approximately $7 million. 

Rational for Emergency Loan 

This $7 million emergency loan would fully eliminate the existing accumulated deficit in the 
City’s General Fund. These emergency loan proceeds would also repay a previous loan from the 
City’s Water Fund and enable further water system improvements. This final step would allow 
Mr. Ambrose to successfully exit as emergency manager and for the City to transition back to 
local control. The City will be bound to implement the financial and operational best practices 
covenanted to in the loan agreement, for the life of the outstanding loan. Lastly, the City meets 
all of the statutory prerequisites to be eligible for this loan under the Emergency Municipal Loan 
Act, MCL 141.931 et seq. 

Loan Properties 

This $7 million loan will be repaid over 15 years, and carries a 2,09% annual interest rate. The 
debt service is level throughout the duration of the loan. Further detail is found in the repayment 
schedule included in this packet. 

Conclusion 


This emergency loan request comes at a time when the City of Flint has made considerable 
financial and operational progress. The proceeds of this loan would be used to eliminate the last 
significant deficit in the City. This action would allow the exit of the emergency manager and 
bind the City to the terms of this loan to ensure prudent financial management for the future of 
the City of Flint.

Mark, 

Per our last conversation, I expressed that we were interested acquiring and distributing 1500 water filters to Flint 
residents to assist with the quality (perceived or real) of their drinking water until the KWA pipeline comes online. 

A few weeks ago, you asked me to send you the product ID number so you could check with your suppliers regarding 
price. I apologize for taking long to send you product ID; a number of conversations needed to occur in Flint before we 
could proceed. 

The product ID for a Brita Filter for kitchen faucets is: 

Product ID 3176421 
UPC 7-23987-0078 

Thank you for taking the time to look into this.

Subject: FW: Need upate on lead / copper tests for Flint 

Guys, here’s an update and some clarification on the lead situation in Flint. Please limit this 
information to internal for now. 


By the tenants of the federal statute, the city is in compliance for lead and copper. That aside, they 
have not optimized their water treatment (for the most part, this means adding phosphates to 
minimize the degree that the water Ph mobilizes lead and copper in people’s home plumbing). 

Compliance with the standard started with testing. A june-Decernber run of tests (all in homes with 
lead in their premise plumbing) concluded in December. Another January -■ June round of sampling 
concluded last month. Everything checks out in terms of compliance, but now the next step is 
optimizing the water supply. 

So, In about two weeks, DEG will be sending a formal communication about the optimizing issue. The 
federal program has long timelines for action. A community water supplier gets 18 months to study 
the options, and two years thereafter to implement water system optimization measures. 


My point: Conceivably, by the time we’re halfway through the first timeline, the city will begin using a 
new water source with KWA ... and conceivably, the whole process starts ail over again . 

In terms of near-future issues, the bottom line is that residents of Flint do not need to worry about 
lead in their water supply, and DEG’s recent sampling does not indicate an eminent health threat from 
lead or copper. That said, anyone with lead pipes in their premise plumbing (this translates to tens of 
thousands of homes in our older urban centers, btw) should at least be aware that, they have them, 
and to some limited degree that’s going to impart minute parts per billion of lead in water no matter 
what. Its why nobody uses lead water pipes anymore. 


i 



The long version of this note is below. Let’s connect next week. I’d like some thoughts about what 
more the state could be doing - most immediately, to convey the results of our testing and teli the 
story to the residents of Flint in an effort to quell some fears. 

Thanks!

Brad, 

As we discussed, the City has completed the last round of monitoring (Jan 1 - June 30, 2015). The last samples came in 
about a week ago. We have made the compliance determination that the 90' j1 percentile level is 11 parts per billion, 
which is below the Action Level Standard of 15 parts per billion (there is no Lead maximum contaminant level 
standard). The federal rule requires measuring lead levels in water from household plumbing materials to determine 
the corrosivity of the City's water in order to limit exposure. 

I have provided a summary of Flint's lead compliance monitoring from the last 20+ years since this regulation started in 
1991, The City of Flint itself has never had a 90 th percentile level exceed the 15 part per billion action level. Sampling 
requirements look at the worst case plumbing materials. Samples must be collected in accordance with the regulatory 
requirements and criteria in order to be used for compliance determinations. 

Because the City of Flint serves a population of over 50,000 they are required to have Fully Optimized Corrosion 
Control. While it is possible to meet the fully optimized requirement without additional treatment, based on their two 
rounds of sampling since switching to the Flint River, we have determined they did not meet the eligibility for this per 
the regulation. They now have to complete a study (within 18 months) and are then allowed a period of additional time 
(2 additional years) to install the selected treatment for Fully Optimized Corrosion Control in accordance with the 
regulatory requirements. This is what DW5D was required to do back in 1993 1997 (see attached letter and 
study). We are planning to suggest the City directly submit a treatment process to shorten the timeline to achieve full 
optimization. This letter is currently being drafted but won't be ready to mail out for another week. 

Liane and i had a conference call with ERA region V in Chicago on Tuesday to go over ail of this and they are in support of 
these next steps with the City. 

The matter will be potentially further complicated when the City switches over to water from the Karegnondi Water 
Authority next year to re-evaiuate the continuing requirement to fully optimize corrosion control. 

The DEQ recognizes that there is has been no level of lead exposure determined to be safe, but again the regulation was 
developed to optimize water corrosivity to limit exposure and the City is following the regulatory requirements. 

Lead is not coming from the Flint River or the City's Water Treatment Plant or the public distribution system. It is from 
lead service lines into homes and from plumbing materials and fixtures within the private property of the household.

As watermains are replaced within the City lead services associated with that section of waterrnain would be replaced in 
order to reconnect to City water. This 'would also place burden on the homeowner to pay for having the service line re- 
plumbed. However, since 2000 only 16 miles of the City's 500 miles of waterrnain have been replaced as they did not 
have the financial means to do so. 

Let us know if there are questions or you need any additional information.

RE: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF DETROIT'S CORROSION CONTROL STUDY 


Enclosed is a copy of the Executive Summary prepared by our consultant. Tucker, Young, 
Jackson & Hull, detailing work to date on the Corrosion Control Study performed for Detroit 
and Detroit's wholesale customers. 

The EPA required large utilities to test water samples in highest risk homes for led and copper 
content in 1 992 to determine if the action levels of 1 5 micrograms per liter and 1 .3 milligrams 
per liter respectively were exceeded. Detroit complied with this requirement and determined 
that the action level for lead was exceeded in many communities. Therefore, DWSD 
conducted and continues to conduct a public education program designed to inform 
consumers how to reduce their exposure to lead. 

The EPA further required large water suppliers to determine if their lead could be less corrosive 
and, if so, the utility was mandated by the Lead and Copper Rule to determine ways the water 
could be made less corrosive and report their recommendations to the primary agency. For 
DWSD, the primary agency is the Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH). 

After several years of study, DWSD is forwarding the complete study findings to the MDPH 
for their consideration. It was concluded that DWSD could reduce the corrosivity of the water 
in the most cost effective and efficient manner by the addition of ortho-phosphate, specifically 
in the form of phosphoric acid. The Executive Summary of these findings is being forwarded 
to you for your information. The MDPH has until the end of December 1994 to consider 
DWSD's recommendation. In the interim, DWSD plans on conducting a demonstration test 
of the corrosion control treatment in our distribution system to further assist the MDPH and 
to further safeguard public health.

4 Introduction 

As a result of the Safe Drinking 
Water Act (SDWA) Amendments of 1986, 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) published final drinking water 
regulations for lead and copper in the June 
7, 1991, Federal Register. Those regulations, 
known as the Lead and Copper Rule 
(LCR), require: 

• Tap water monitoring, which is a 
new approach for water utilities 

• Treatment optimization for lead and 
copper corrosion control 

• Public education and lead sendee 
line removal if utilities exceed preset 
lead or copper levels 

Large utilities, sendng populations 
greater than 50,000, are required to 
conduct corrosion control studies to 
demonstrate that they are either already 
providing optimal treatment or to deter- 
mine optimal treatment for their system. 

DWSD made necessary public notices 
and embanked on studies to develop 
optimal treatment solutions. 

In response to the regulations, the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department 
(DWSD) conducted two rounds of moni- 
toring at home water taps for lead and 
copper and throughout the distribution 
systems for other water quality param- 
eters. Monitoring was a cooperative effort 
between the DWSD, wholesale water 
customers, and the Michigan Department 
of Public Health (MDPH). Copper levels 
were well below EPA limits. Lead levels, 
however, exceeded EPA action levels 


(ALs) and DWSD made necessary public 
notices and embarked on studies to 
develop optimal treatment solutions. 

Lead exposure sources for humans 
include air, food, dust, paint, and drinking 
water. Elevated lead levels in blood have 
been associated with adverse health effects 
in humans. Federal health authorities have 
many programs to reduce lead exposure 
including low-lead gasoline and reduced 
lead content in paint. Although drinking 
water may not be the major source of lead, 
reducing lead levels in drinking water will 
have a positive health benefit. An addi- 
tional benefit of corrosion control is 
prolonged life for water distribution pipes 
and home plumbing. This results in lower 
costs for water utilities and their customers. 

In March 1992, the DWSD contracted 
with Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. 
(TYJT), in association with CH2M HILL, 
INC., and Economic and Engineering 
Services, Inc. (EES), to perform a lead and 
copper corrosion control study. The 
purpose of the study was to determine the 
optima! approach for reducing lead and 
copper concentrations in DWSD drinking 
water without adversely affecting other 
water quality characteristics. Major tasks 
in this study were to: 

• Evaluate existing water quality data, 
existing distribution system pipe 
materials and the results of lead and 
copper sampling 

• Identify and analyze feasible and 
practical treatment methods to 
reduce lead and copper corrosion 
(desktop analysis) 

• Design and construct a pipe-loop 
testing apparatus to evaluate 
treatment alternatives identified in 
the desktop analysis

Executive Summary 


* Operate the pipe loops for 1 year to 
evaluate selected corrosion control 
treatments on different pipe 
materials 

* Evaluate the effectiveness and 
feasibility of the tested treatment 
alternatives in reducing lead and 
copper concentrations 

• Recommend an optimum lead 
corrosion control treatment 

• Develop an implementation plan for 
full-scale corrosion control facilities 

This report presents the results of the 
DWSD Lead and Copper Corrosion 
Control Optimization Study.

DWSD Water System 


The DWSD obtains water from three 
intakes. Two of these, the Belle Isle and the 
Fighting Island Intakes, take water from 
the Detroit River. The third intake is on 
Lake Huron. Water is treated at five water 
treatment plants (WTPs) including the 
Water Works Park, Southwest, 

Springwells, Northeast, and Lake Huron 
WTPs. The water system is shown in 
Figure ES-1. Treated water from the 5 
WTPs is distributed to the City of Detroit 
and 119 wholesale water customer sys- 
tems. The DWSD water system serves 
about 4 million people. 

Water leaving the WTPs is of good 
quality and considered moderately

corrosive. For example, pH from the five 
WTPs averages 7.4, alkalinity averages 76 
mg/L (CaC0 3 ), and hardness averages 100 
mg/L (CaCOj). Nevertheless, some 
increase in lead and copper is resulting 
from the corrosive action of the water, 
primarily on sendee pipe and household 
plumbing. The main sources of lead are 
50:50 lead/tin solder, brass containing 
lead used in faucets, and lead sendee lines 
and plumbing. 

The regulation lead AL is 0,015 mg/L 
at the 90th percentile in home water taps. 
During the LCR Compliance Monitoring 
conducted in 1992, DWSD's 90th percen- 
tile lead concentration was 0.017 mg/L in 
the first round and 0.023 mg/L in the 
second round of sampling (Figure ES-2). 
Looking at the data in a slightly different 
manner, 35 to 37 percent of the 119 pur- 
veyor water systems exceeded the AL 
for lead. 


Figure ES-2 

LCR Compliance Monitoring Results for Lead 



Round 1 Rouid 2 


For copper, the 90th percentile 
concentrations were 0.34 and 0.19 mg/L 
for two rounds of sampling-well below 
the copper AL of 1.3 mg/L (Figure ES-3). 
Lead uptake, therefore, is the major 
concern within the DWSD water system. 

Determining the optimal lead control 
treatment is essential; it is the objective of 
conducting this corrosion control study. 
Further, there are an estimated 200,000 
lead service lines (LSLs) in DWSD's direct 
sendee area and possibly more in areas 
sensed by wholesale customers. After 
corrosion treatment is optimized, the 
possibility exists that lead ALs may still be 
over 0.015 mg/L at the 90th percentile. 
Should this occur, the DWSD would need 
to embark on a removal program for LSLs, 
which could cost between $300 and 
$800 million. 

4 Desktop Analysis 

To reduce the number of chemicals 
for long-term testing, a screening analysis 
was performed using desktop techniques 
recommended by U.S. EPA. Lead corro- 
sion control treatment methods examined 
for their applicability to DWSD are as 
follows: 

* Polyphosphates 

« Orthophosphates 

♦ Zinc orthophosphate 

• Polyphosphate/orthophosphate 

blends 

• Silicates 

• pH adjustment 

* Alkalinity adjustment 

* Calcium adjustment 

The main criteria for selecting a lead 
corrosion control method is performance 
for lead uptake reduction. Lead corrosion 
control methods were also evaluated

Executive Summary

LCR Compliance Monitoring Results tor Capper 



based on effects on other drinking water 
regulations, industrial water users, 
wastewater treatment, water quality, 
water treatment operations, consecutive 
water systems, and multiple sources of 
supply and treatment. 

Based on this evaluation, the follow- 
ing chemical treatments were eliminated 
from consideration for pipe-loop testing. 

* Polyphosphates. These products are 
primarily used to sequester iron, 
calcium, and manganese and may 
actually do more to promote lead 
corrosion than to prevent it. 

• Polyphosphate/Orthophosphate 
Blends. These products have not 
been proven to be more effective 
than orthophosphates alone for lead 
reduction, and their proprietary 
chemical composition makes 
selection of the optimum product 
difficult. 


• Silicates. Sodium silicate inhibitors 
require a high dosage for lead 
control and, based on a survey of 
major industries, would have 
significant adverse effects on 
industrial water users. 

• Alkalinity Adjustment. This 
technique would have marginal 
performance for lead reduction 
based on DWSD water quality and 
would be impractical for a system 
the size of DWSD. 

• Calcium Adjustment to Deposit a 
Calcium Carbonate Layer. This 
technique is not a proven method 
for lead reduction, and would be 
difficult to produce a uniform layer 
throughout a distribution system 
the size of DWSD. Calcium 
carbonate deposition, however, can 
occur when pH is raised for lead 
reduction. This situation is 
addressed under the pH adjustment 
alternative. 

Lead corrosion control treatment 
methods applicable for DWSD water are 
as follows: 

• Orthophosphates. These products 
have been shown to be an effective 
means of lead reduction for water 
similar to that of the DWSD. 

• Zinc Orthophosphate. These 
products are also a proven method 
of lead reduction, although there is 
concern about zinc in industrial 
water and wastewater. 

• pH adjustment. This technique is 
also a proven method of reducing 
lead solubility, although higher pHs 
affect some industrial users and can 
increase calcium carbonate 
deposition. 


Executive Stanmary

:£pf-7v 


A survey of 16 Great Lakes area 
water utilities using water of similar 
quality to that of DWSD demonstrated the 
effectiveness of orthophosphate, zinc 
orthophosphate, and pH adjustment in 
reducing lead concentrations at the 
consumers' taps. Those treatment meth- 
ods, therefore, were retained for further 
testing in the pipe-loop apparatus. 

| Pipe-Loop Testing 

Based on the desktop analysis, it was 
concluded that the following treatments 
would be tested in the pipe loops: 

• Adjusting pH to 8.1 using sodium 
hydroxide 

• Adjusting pH to 8.7 using sodium 
hydroxide 

• Adding zinc orthophosphate at 
doses of 0.4 mg/L for zinc and 
phosphorous (as P) 

• Adding orthophosphate using phos- 
phoric acid at a dose of 0,4 mg/L as P 


Pipe-loop testing produces information 
on the corrosion control treatment 
most likely to effectively reduce lead 
levels. 


It is important to understand that 
pipe-loop testing is conducted to provide 
information on the relative effectiveness 
of corrosion control treatments. The results 
cannot be used to predict actual lead 
levels that may occur at customers' taps in 
the water system. Pipe-loop testing, 
however, produces information on the 
corrosion control treatment most likely to 
effectively reduce lead levels and is an 
approved optimization technique. 

S Executive Summary 


Figure ES-4 

Typical Testing Apparatus 



A pilot-scale testing apparatus was 
designed and constructed to test each of 
the treatment techniques on different pipe 
materials. Five pipe-loop racks were 
constructed: one for each of the four 
methods and another for control (no 
treatment provided). Each pipe-loop rack 
included one new lead pipe loop, two 
identical copper pipe loops with lead 
soldered joints, one brass tester, and one 
section of old lead pipe. Three weight loss 
testers were also included for measuring 
corrosion rates of steel, galvanized steel, 
and copper. A typical testing apparatus is 
shown in Figure ES4. 

The pipe-loop facility was installed 
in the lower level of the Water Works Park 
High Service Pump Station and operated 
from January to November, 1993. After an 
initial period of passivation, water 
samples were collected on a weekly basis 
and analyzed for lead, copper, and zinc. 
The 1-liter water samples were taken after 
the water had been in contact with the 
pipe loop materials for 8 hours. This was 
done to represent the first-draw sampling 
required by the LCR. Additional sampling 
included daily monitoring for pH, chemi- 
cal doses, and temperature. Disinfection 





by-products (DBPs) and pipe insert weight 
loss were done quarterly. Flavor profile 
analyses to assess any changes in tastes or 
odors were run monthly. 

Results of pilot testing indicated: 

♦ The inhibitor treatments, zinc 
orthophosphate, and phosphoric 
acid are statistically better than the 
untreated control for both old and 
new lead piping (Figure ES-5). 

• For lead solder and copper piping, 
the median lead levels were lowest 
in the water with inhibitors (zinc 


orthophosphate and phosphoric 
acid), but only the phosphoric acid 
results were statistically better than 
the other loops (Figure ES-6). 

For brass, the results indicated that 
the treatments were no better than 
the control; however, lead levels 
were near the detection limit in the 
brass testers (Figure ES-6). 

Zinc orthophosphate and 
phosphoric acid were also found to 
be the most effective treatments in 
reducing copper (Figure ES-7).

* DPBs were increased for the pH 
adjustment treatments as expected. 
The DBPs formed as a result of this 
increase, however, did not exceed 
EPA-proposed limits. The 
orthophosphate and zinc 
orthophosphate did not increase 
DBPs. 

• None of the corrosion control 
treatments had an adverse effect on 
the taste and odor of the water 
produced. 


I Evaluating Corrosion 
Control Treatment 

The four corrosion control treatments 
tested in the pipe loops were evaluated 
based on the following criteria: 

• Performance for lead uptake 
reduction 

• Feasibility of implementation within 
regulatory and functional constraints 

• Reliability in terms of operational 
consistency and continuous 
corrosion control protection 

• Cost 

Pipe-loop data analyses indicated 
orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate 
are most likely to yield the best results for 
lead reduction. pH adjustment was not as 
effective for lead control. Orthophosphate 
and zinc orthophosphate were effective at 
reducing copper levels. 

A feasibility analysis indicated that 
industrial water users would be affected 
adversely by zinc or a higher water pH. 
Wastewater operations would be ad- 
versely affected by zinc and orthophos- 
phates loadings. There were no major 
effects of corrosion control treatment on 
drinking water regulations. pH adjust- 
ment could, however, decrease disinfec- 
tion effectiveness and increase DBP 
formation. 

The reliability of zinc orthophos- 
phate and sodium hydroxide chemicals is 
less than would be expected for ortho- 
phosphates. Zinc orthophosphate is a

age industry; therefore, price and avail- 
ability are more stable. From a WTP- 
operations standpoint, pH adjustment is 
less reliable because pH can change with 
raw water quality and treatment conditions. 

The chemical cost of each treatment 
alternative is shown in Figure ES-8. 
Phosphoric acid addition is less than half 
the cost of pH adjustment to 8.1, the next 
lowest chemical cost. This represents an

average cost savings of about $2,400 per 
day. Phosphoric acid could save the 
DWSD about $10 million in present worth 
in the next 20 years compared to the next 
lowest cost alternative. 

4 Selecting Corrosion 
Control Treatment 

The relative ranking of alternatives 
for the four criteria (performance, feasibil- 
ity, reliability, cost) is summarized in 
Figure ES-9. Values of 1 through 4 were 
assigned for each treatment alternative in 
each criteria category (1 was best; 4 worst). 
Because performance for lead reduction 
was the main criteria, it was given a 
weight of 2. Each of the other criteria was 
given a weight of 1. 

Orthophosphates were ranked 
highest overall. Zinc orthophosphate was 
second, mainly because of its adverse 
effects on industry, wastewater plant 
operations, and higher costs. pH adjust- 
ment was ranked lowest because it is less 
effective for lead reduction, less reliable, 
and demonstrates more adverse effects on 
industry and drinking water regulatory 
compliance. 


Optnophosphates were selected as 
the optimal treatment alternative for 
lull-scale lead corrosion control. 


Based on corrosion control theory, 
comparison with analogous water sys- 
tems, and the extensive pilot plant studies, 
orthophosphates were selected as the 
optimal treatment alternative for full-scale 
lead corrosion control.

Phosphoric acid is the recommended 
form of adding orthophosphate. It is a 
generic chemical and can be bid competi- 
tively. It does not add sodium to the water 
and costs less than any other form of 
orthophosphate. In addition, the finished 
water pH is already in the optimal range 
for lead solubility reduction by phos- 
phates, so pH adjustment is not required. 

The recommended dose of phospho- 
ric acid is 1.2 mg/L as P for initial passiva- 
tion and a sustained dose of 0.4 mg/L as P 
for maintaining control of lead uptake. 
Values may be adjusted based on full-scale 
results. 

3 Full-Scale Implementation 

The LCR requires optimal corrosion 
control treatment installation by January 1, 
1997. To meet this deadline, the implemen- 
tation schedule in Figure ES-10 is pro- 
posed. The first element of implementa- 
tion is to conduct full-scale demonstration 
testing in the distribution system served 


by one of the WTPs before installing 
chemical feed facilities in the other four 
plants. Operation of lead corrosion control 
facilities at all plants is planned for May 
1996. This will provide additional time to 
optimize the system before lead monitor- 
ing is required in 1997. 

The chemical equipment required for 
each WTP is summarized in Table ES-1. A 
schematic of a typical liquid chemical 
system is shown in Figure ES-11. 


The cost of lead corrosion control 
chemicals is estimated to he about 
$0.87 per year per household. 


The estimated capital cost for 
corrosion control facilities at the five 
WTPs is $3,740,000. The estimated cost of 
chemicals is $868,000 per year. The cost of 
lead corrosion control chemicals is esti- 
mated to be about $0.87 per year per 
household.

Executive Summary 











of lead reduction, such as removing lead 
service lines, will not be required. 

If the lead AL is still exceeded after 
optimization and stabilization, a program 
for lead service line removal should be 
developed in addition to an ongoing public 
education program. 


Operation of lead corrosion control 
facilities at ail plants is planned for 
May 1996.

Attention: Mr. Charles Smith, Utilities Superintendent 

Subject: Lead/Copper Monitoring 

Gentlemen: 

We have reviewed the results of the second round of the lead and 
copper monitoring completed for your water supply for the period of 
July 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992. The samples were 

collected and analyzed to comply with the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's Lead and Copper Regulation. The action levels 
specified in the regulation require that the 90th percentile 
results from the distribution system samples for lead and copper 
not exceed 15 and 1300 ug/1, respectively. 

Since the 90th percentile lead level for your water system is 14.4 
ug/1, the lead action level of 15 ug/1 has not been exceeded. 
Also, the 90th percentile copper level was significantly below the 
copper action level of 1300 ug/1. This means that your water 
system has met both action levels for the first two monitoring 
periods . 

Although many of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) 
customers have met' the action levels, DWSD is required to conduct 
a study to determine whether their water treatment processes can be 
improved to further reduce corrosion. The study is to be completed 
by July 1, 1994, and any recommended treatment modifications must 
be in place by January 1, 1997. 




City of Flint 
Page 2 

March 15, 1993 


Further monitoring of your water system for lead and copper will 
not be required until the DWSD study is complete and any additional 
corrosion control treatment has begun. We will inform you when 
monitoring is again required. This may be as late as January 1997. 

.If you have any questions, please call me at (517) 335-8309.

RE: Water Filter 

Harvey - 



We are all set. Stacie Behler can serve as liaison on this one. The merchant team can source 1,500 filters. We will get 
them to the community at cost. My guess is this will be $20k or so, but the team will give you a final number. 

Because we don't want to be a state vendor, we won't sell them to you. Stacie will work out logistics of whether we 
make a donation of gift cards to the state that you use to purchase them, or whether there is some other entity to which 
we can give them. 

Given all the circumstances, we are not interested in any publicity. We want it to be clear that the state is providing 
these, not Meijer. 

Thanks for reaching out.

Meijer needs some help supporting the Flint Michigan community and was hoping Clorox can jump in. 

They are having some issues with water quality and are looking for a donation of 1500 water filters for drinking water. 
Would Clorox consider donating as a silent partner with Meijer? 

Please let me know as we want to support the community.

Good Morning All, 

Thank you, again. 

Is it possible to delay the shipment of the filters until next Tuesday, August 4? 

I was just informed they are creating a distribution plan in Flint so the filters can be given to the community when 
received. This will alleviate the church having to store the filters. 

I apologize for not communicating this sooner. Please let me know if the delay is possible.

Bob, 

I hope all is well for you and I look forward to seeing you this fall at our vendor summit. 

Meijer needs some help supporting the Flint Michigan community and was hoping Clorox can jump in. 

They are having some issues with water quality and are looking for a donation of 1500 water filters for drinking water. 
Would Clorox consider donating as a silent partner with Meijer? 

Please let me know as we want to support the community. 

Best Regards, 

Jamie

Flint Water Filter Distribution Plan 


Rev. Overton, 

This email is a follow up to our conversation regarding the distribution plan for the donated water 
filters. I’m typing this since you were driving and had to tell me verbally. Please let me know if I 
missed anything. 

1500 filters are being donated 

s 500 will be distributed at Mt. Carmel church on the North End 
S 500 will be distributed at Woodside Church on the East End 

S 500 will be distributed on the South End (you are awaiting confirmation on the location) 

Communication about distribution of the water filters 

S Faith-based Newspaper 
S Radio 
S Talk Shows 
S Ch. 12 News 

Qualifications to receive a filter 

S Must be a Flint resident (verified by driver’s license) 

S Distributions at all sites will be monitored to ensure there is only per household 

Potential Issues 

s Concerned Pastors group would like filters to go only to low income families 
s Coalition for Clean Water believes anyone should be able to get the filters since everyone 
drinks the same water no matter income 

s The Coalition believes 1500 is not nearly an adequate number to address the problem 
•S The Pastors want to work with what they have right now and address getting more later 
s Pastor Overton wants to ensure this disagreement on the number does not become the focal 
point of Tuesday’s meeting 
•S Contamination levels still need to be addressed

RE: '20150804_Meeting with Flint's Clean Water Coalition 


I didn't think that meeting was as useful as others, if people won't accept the factual information. I'm not sure there is 
much we can do about it. They're getting their own filters, we've Installed six at the main and i thought there were six 
more coming. As for the flushing, that's part of any city's water system, and people in every community pay for it. As to 
the frequency, there must be a plan to reduce the number of times. 


Questions: 

Why does KWA only produce 18 million gals? Doesn't make sense to have a system that doesn't produce enough water. 
Where do they expect to get the other from? Especially since GM doesn't want the Flint river water (even though 
presumably GM has been both the biggest commercial user and disposer}, how do they separate out the flow ? 

We can't do too many more of these. The three activists in the room just want to be right, they don't want answers. No 
matter what we say they'll always want something else to be the answer. The Pastors and the woman form yesterday 
who usually sits across from me and who always lectures us (that's just a reminder of some of the old time negative 
racial experiences she's had and I get it) are really a strong group of people. Usually there is a black woman who comes 
with them, but I missed her yesterday. I really her and of course, Overton and Hill are pretty impressive people in their 
own right

All, 

On behalf of the Governor’s Office, please accept this email as a thank you to Meijer and Clorox for 
the donation of 1500 kitchen water filters for Flint residents. I am aware you do not want any publicity 
or credit for the donation, but it is important for you to know the added comfort these filters will 
provide to the recipients as the water issue is resolved. 

The Flint Concerned Pastors organization held an event yesterday to give away the filters. Residents 
were invited to come to a central location to pick up their filter. The Concerned Pastors targeted low 
income Flint residents and more than 1500 households showed up. They exhausted the donated 
supply in 4 hours with 200 people still waiting to get a filter. 

Again, we appreciate Meijer and Clorox for being good corporate citizens. I wish all of you a Happy 
and Safe Labor Day Weekend. 

Best, 

Harvey

My apologies. You now have the correct attachment. 


I am sending this email to renew my request for assistance from the Governor's Office. 

As we engage these challenges, Flint must revisit the present water revolving loan plans to determine how 
these current funding obligations will affect water delivery and asset development for the future. It is clear 
that no significant improvements can be obtained without some supportive concessions. Therefore, I am 
requesting on behalf of the 34 th district (Flint) for you to consider an Executive decision to forgive (in-total or 
part) Flint's water fund loan balances of $20,770,336.00 so that we may effectively apply those funds to 
rebuilding the City's infrastructure, to competitively obtaining highly qualified personnel and provide a more 
cost effective water delivery system. Hence, I know there has been many request made of your office to 
resolve this very serious issue but this approach will best safeguard the health and welfare of the residents of 
Flint as well as minimize the potential for litigation against the City of Flint and/or the State of Michigan. 

Please see a previous request letter for assistance attached to this communication. 

Thank you

MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Sheldon A* Neeley 

STATE REPRESENTATIVE 


January 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 


Dear Gov. Snyder, 

With the dawn of a new beginning in our state, the city of Flint stands on the precipice of civil 
unrest. This letter comes as an appeal to your office concerning this proud Michigan community 
and recent discussions pertaining to Flint’s water distribution and management strategies for both 
present and future operations. Flint has had a long history concerning the implementation of 
water practices and financial management of its water assets. Our present journey has caused us 
to take a closer look at our 80-year-old infrastructure and examine a difficult position where we 
must correct some past and even present challenges, one of which is affecting the people of my 
community to the point of a fervor over something as simple as drinking clean water. 

As we engage these challenges, Flint must revisit the present water revolving loan plans to 
determine how these current funding obligations will affect water delivery and asset 
development for the future. It is clear that no significant improvements can be obtained without 
some supportive concessions. Therefore, I am requesting on behalf of the 34th District, which 
contains a portion of the city of Flint, for you to consider an executive decision to forgive (in- 
total or part) Flint’s water fund loan balances of $20,770,336 so that we may effectively apply 
those funds to rebuilding the city’s infrastructure, to competitively obtain highly qualified 
personnel and provide a more cost effective water delivery system. I understand there has been 
many requests made of your office to resolve this very serious issue, but this approach will best 
safeguard the health and welfare of the residents of Flint as well as minimize the potential for 
litigation against the city of Flint and/or the state of Michigan. 

With a cost-effective water delivery system, we will be able to improve our system in the 
following ways: upgrade wastewater treatment processes, improve safe drinking water upgrades, 
and maintain and sustain a water system that provides a better quality of water product to the 
citizens of Flint.

It is imperative that this issue be addressed in some way on the state level. Residents of Flint are 
already finding themselves forced to take drastic measures simply to have clean drinking water. 

Community health could be on the decline as citizens become afraid to even shower or bathe in 
their homes. The people of Flint bring bottles of brown water full of sediment and other foreign 
substances to community meetings, asking only to be treated as human beings. That is all I am 
asking of you - to see the suffering and anger from the people in one of Michigan’s 
municipalities and understand that there is a need to react and respond to this crisis. 

With the beginning of a new year to work toward a better Michigan, my office is ready to have 
discussions on this request and other planning that works to improve OUR Michigan. I sincerely 
thank you in advance for your consideration on this matter. 

For the Love of the Community,

Flint water 

Harvey, 



It was nice running into you last week on the Metro in DC. I hope the CBC conference was productive. I'm glad we had 
the opportunity to discuss the challenges with Flint's water system. As you're probably aware, the situation has really 
deteriorated over the past couple weeks, even since we spoke. It's becoming more and more clear that there's a real 
lead problem in the City, even though the official City/M DEQ tests aren't yet showing lead levels that exceed the EPA 
standard. For example, researchers at Flurley Hospital are seeing dangerous lead levels in children they treat 
( http://www.mlive.com/news/'flint/index.ssf/2015/09/studv shows twice as many flin.htmi#incart river ). 

The City is planning to issue a health advisory, and the US Department of Agriculture will probably start providing pre- 
mixed formula to parents in the WIC program. There's also big push to buy filters using private donations. Those are 
both important short-term responses to mitigate the hazard for the most vulnerable. 

But there's still the question of how to "fix" the problem. I have some thoughts I'd like to run by you, but it might be 
best to discuss by phone. Could you spare 15 minutes, sometime tomorrow (Friday)? 

Thanks, 

Paul

Angela will contact you to set up a conference call for tomorrow afternoon. Because Wayne is out of town Tom Saxton

on the call. 


We have a number of follow-up questions: What is the basis for the estimated $18M cost to temporarily reconnect to 
the Great Lakes Water Authority? What is the timeline? Why didn't Viola advise the City about the potential for 
elevated lead levels when using Flint river water? What assurances do you have indicating a temporary reconnection to 
the Water Authority resolves the elevated lead problem or other system problems? Who are the assurances from? Did 
the Viola report recommend using Ortho Phosphates to treat the water?

Frank, 

Received your email from Craig. We would be glad to help.

Can you provide any additional information on filter sizes needed in the area and quantity you might be looking for? 
We are also going to look to donate bottled water if that makes sense?

Subject: Update at Genesee County Community Action Resource Department 

Dear Geralyn, Angela, and Elizabeth, 

After the meeting, I called Matt Purcell from the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department (GCCARD). They work directly with low-income individuals and families. GCCARD provides 
a variety of services including food, weatherization, shelter, clothing assistance, rental assistance, utility 
assistance, tax prep, and education. 

GCCARD is located at the following address: 

601 N. Saginaw Street 

Suite IB 

Flint, Ml 48502 


Summary of Conversation: 

GCCARD has not taken any action at this point. Leaders in GCCARD are discussing the issue. Efforts on 
the ground seem to be disjointed. Some local agencies are offering water bottles to people. There is an 
apparent lack of leadership. GCCARD is ready to help out but needs leadership, guidance, direction, and 
information. They may be able to redirect some CSBG funds to help out, none have been allocated at 
this time. 

Thanks, 

Kris

Subject: Flint Water Filter Discussion 

As you may be aware, the Department of Health 
and Human Services has secured funding to 
purchase water filters for residents of Flint who are 
currently connected to the Flint City Water System, 
supplied by the Flint River. The GCCARD will be 
receiving an initial shipment of filters for 
distribution Monday. I would like to convene a 
meeting Monday morning to discuss the logistics of 
distributing these filters, as well as a system for 
tracking. Given your position in the community 
and relationship with DHHS, it would be extremely 
helpful if you could attend this meeting so we can 
get direction on this distribution. We will be 
meeting at 8:30 at 4809 Clio Road. I will be 
attending the meeting convened by the United 
Way at 10:00 . and would like to share our plan at 
that time. Please feel free to contact me on my cell 
phone, for more information.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: October 7, 2015

State offering extended, weekend hours for water filter distribution at Lippincott GCCARD 

Nearly 5,000 NSF certified filters issued by MDHHS to Flint residents since Monday 

LANSING, Mich. - Flint residents and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services clients 
with a city of Flint water bill will now be able to take advantage of extended hours this Thursday, 
Friday, and Saturday at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department 2727 
Lippincott location. Extended hours will be offered at the Lippincott facility only, and will run until 7 
p.m. on Thursday and Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The other three locations will 







maintain 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. operating hours, Monday through Friday, for filter pick up. 


Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive, reemphasized that the Brita SAFF-100 filters 
being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the NSF/ANSI 53 standards for drinking 
water treatment units. 

“The Brita faucet filtration system that we are distributing to residents are National Sanitation 
Foundation certified to reduce lead in drinking water,” said Dr. Eden Wells. “When connected 
appropriately, these filters improve water quality by filtering out contaminates including lead, 
chlorine, benzene and other chemicals.” 

Since Monday when MDHHS announced that free water filters would be distributed at four Flint 
locations, the state and GCCARD have partnered to issue approximately 5,000 free NSF certified 
water filters to residents that are on the city of Flint water system. The distribution of filters is part of 
the administration’s comprehensive approach to addressing water concerns in the area. These NSF 
certified water filters remove lead in the water administered through water taps in homes. 

MDHHS clients and residents with a city of Flint water bill may take advantage of the extended 
hours at the Lippincott GCCARD. During the regular business hours, MDHHS clients are 
encouraged to visit either the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office location; residents 
on Flint water who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs should visit the 
GCCARD offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw. Staff will be onsite at all four locations 
to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

MDHHS clients in the city of Flint who are active recipients should bring valid identification and a 
copy of their water bill to their local MDHHS office. Flint residents who are not active MDHHS 
clients should bring identification and their city of Flint water bill to a GCCARD location. 

MDHHS is urging all residents do their part to prevent elevated blood lead levels in children. For 
more information on prevention, visit www.michiqan.gov/lead . or contact your local health 
department. For updates on Flint water and resources, visit www. m i ch i ga n . qov/f I i ntwater .

FW: Flint City Council KWA Vote 

Mary Beth, 



Harvey is still waiting on hearing back from the city to get the original resolution but here are the mlive pieces that 
covered it from March 2013 until July 2013. The meeting when the vote was held was March 25, 2013. Here is what we 
have so far. I'll forward the actual resolution as soon as we receive it. 

Stacie 

March 25 th 2013 Flint council supports buying water from Lake Huron through KWA 

The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


7 th Ward council person Dale Weigh ill was absent 
3 rd Ward councilperson Bryant Nolden opposed 
The rest were in favor. 


March 25 th , 2013 Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still needed 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint 
for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the City. Another 2 million gallons per day would come 
from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or 
there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water plant. Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is 
currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times per year. 


April 12 th State gives Flint OK to join Karegnondi Water Authority project, but Detroit gets to 
make final offer

The meeting comes in the same week that the Flint and Genesee County rejected a final offer to 
continue buying water from Detroit, and two days after Detroit gave Flint, a notice of termination of its 
1965 water contract. 


April 19 th Detroit gives notices It's terminating water contract covering Flint, Genesee County in 


one year

The city of Detroit has given notice that it's terminating a nearly 50-year-old contract for selling water 
to Flint and the county next year. 


July 23 rd Hint River now an option for drinking water following Detroit's termination of 
contract 

litti > ; // wwvy < ,miive.com/news/ilmt/im1ex,ssf/20iH/o7/cit% 7 readying water p lant to Dhtml 


The Flint River was not a viable option to provide drinking water to city residents when the water 
relationship between Flint and Detroit was stable. But river water might he used temporarily as the 
city's water supply now that Flint signed an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority and will 
get up to 18 million gallons per day of raw water in 2016 from Lake Huron, The Flint River hadn't 
been an option, city officials previously said, because upgrades to Flint's water plant would be too 
expensive, the river didn't provide enough capacity to serve Flint residents' water needs and the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality would not allow it.

Actually it seems like he threw you and me under the bus and frankly i didn't appreciate it. I'm pissed at Ananich also

Chief— I hear you, but I consider Phelps lawsuit and Ananich's rhetoric to be just as incendiary. Sheldon is frustrated. He 
reached out to DEQ early before all this broke and was blown off. He sent a letter to DHHS and got no response when 
he was told that they would get back with him by Tuesday this week. Ananich has met with the Governor, to my 
knowledge he hasn't on this issue. Ananich has had meetings the each of the Directors at issue a few times, he hasn't 
and his district is the city of Flint. While I do not like his approach with MSP on high speed chases, on this issue he has 
been more reasonable than most.

Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 

Dear Gov. Snyder, 

I'm writing to voice my displeasure with the lack of communication between your office and mine 
concerning the water crisis in the city of Flint. 

Since I have been in a position to represent my community at the Capitol, I have been in constant 
contact with your office to offer advice, help, partnership and solutions. My community elected me to 
represent them in Lansing, and I have been striving to do just that. Several letters have reached your 
office, and I have been highly vocal about the need to come together to fix the water crisis. This has 
been done with the understanding that we both care about the people of Flint, who I represent in the 
Legislature, and who you represent as governor of this state. 


l 


I have also reached out to Dr. Eden Wells and the Department of Health and Human Services and the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to be proactive in addressing the issue of lead-laced 
water damaging the minds and bodies of Flint's citizens, especially the children. While this crisis could be 
solved by switching water sources, the problems will remain in the health of our future generation. 

I had hoped that this entire problem would have been addressed through partnership, teamwork and 
cooperation. It is unfortunate that hasn't been the case. It is also unfortunate that common courtesy to 
my office on being kept up to speed with any operational changes and financial solutions has not been 
timely communicated. 

I will continue to keep the lines of communication open as we address the continued problem of health 
in Flint, and I hope you will take the opportunity to join me in conversation to find future solutions. 

For the Love of the Community, 

Sheldon A. Neeley, State Representative 
34 th District

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, 
environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and 
Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, 
public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the 
state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the 
MEC for six years. 


i 



Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan 
Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having 
joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public 
Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community 
Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served 
as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as 
Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the county’s 
bankruptcy and issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of 
Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, 
wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Children’s Health 
Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice 
for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Re: Letter of Support for Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant 
County: Genesee Local Unit Code: 252040 

To whom it may Concern: 

Please accept this letter as the City of Flint's commitment to the Michigan Department of Treasury's 
Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program for the Dupont Street Water Main 
Replacement Project 

The replacement of 1.6 miles of water main along Dupont Street is an essential step in addressing the 
City's water quality challenges. The City's water system is severely antiquated, which is contributing to 
the current public health emergency, excessive water main breaks, and inefficient distribution of water 
to residents and businesses. The replacement of this water main will move the City closer to providing 
efficient, clean, and safe water to the public. 

Even though the City has progressed to strategically reduce deficits by seeking new millages, reducing 
staff, and reducing services, the City still faces critical financial obstacles. The City does not have the 
financial resources to undertake and pay for a project of this nature. Further, any expenditure by the 
City for goods or services in excess of $75,000 must be approved by a Receivership Transition Advisory 
Board. The FDCVT Grant is essential for the successful implementation of this project, which will 
improve the safety, reliability, and sustainability of the City's water system.

Part 5: Proposal Details 

Question 24, Describe the current state of affairs. What is working well? What is not working? Explain 
the current condition of infrastructure/equipment. 

The City is currently facing a public health emergency. Water from the Flint River, the City's water 
source, has been leeching lead from old pipes and solder, contaminating the water supply. Elevated lead 
levels in children were discovered by physicians at Hurley Hospital and The Genesee County Health 
Department has issued a Public Health Advisory. 

The City of Flint is currently in a state of fiscal distress at a time in which considerable demands are 
placed upon it relating to water provision, court orders, and assessing practices compliance, The City is 
attempting to cope with these demands, while revenues are down or drastically reduced. Even though 
the City has progressed to strategically reduce deficits by seeking new millages, reducing the number of 
city employees and related costs, and ultimately reducing the services to the public, the City continues 
to face critical financial challenges. Both the income tax and property tax revenue bases have declined 
by 55% since the economic downturn in 2008. The current resources available to the City are very 
restricted and limited. 

The City of Flint has been in receivership since December 2011. At that time, the State of Michigan 
Financial Review Team found that the City has a General Fund deficit of $14,621,546 as of June 30 th , 
2010, which was not eliminated within the two year preceding period. 

The City previously submitted a five year deficit elimination plan for a cumulative general fund deficit of 
$7,046,820 as of June 30 th , 2008, However, by June 30 th , 2010, the cumulative general fund deficit had 
grown to $14,621,546. An updated plan submitted for 2010 did not purport to eliminate cumulative 
deficit until 2030 and that relied upon the issuance of an additional $12 million of debt in 2013, 

A structural operating deficit existed in the general fund as of June 30, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and the 
General Fund was projected to have a $6,768,864 deficit as of June 30, 2011. 

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was received in 
December 2011. The City's General Fund, which had a $14.6 million deficit at the beginning of the year, 
ended it with an $8,9 million deficit. The reduction in the deficit was due solely to an $8 million Fiscal 
Stabilization Bond issued by the city in March 2011. In total, excluding the impact of the FSB proceeds 
and the Genesee Towers judgment levy, expenses in the General Fund exceeded revenues. The City's 
Comprehensive Financial Report revealed an unassigned deficit in the General Fund of $8,961,427 as of 
June 30, 2014, which had resulted from operating deficits. 

The City does not have a current bond rating. The most recent bond rating was from over a decade ago 
and received a score of Bal, a qualifying indicator of fiscal distress. 

As part of a recent judgment, the City was ordered to repay its Water and Sewer Fund 15.7 million from 
its General Fund. The recent water challenges have also resulted a lower frequency of bill payments 
from residents, further reducing revenues. This places considerable strain on the City's path to recovery 
as it struggles to emerge from receivership.

The City is in transition back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department as the source of water. This 
project comes at a cost of $2 million from the City's Water and Sewer Fund, an unanticipated expense. It 
is imperative that old pipes and water lines need to be addressed in order to arrive at a long term 
solution that will safeguard the public health, return public confidence in the Water System, resulting in 
a return to a sustainable Water and Sewer Fund. The City is the water provider, and as such, it has an 
obligation to provide clean and safe water for residents. 


The Dupont Street Project is a catalytic endeavor that will begin the process of replacing old 
infrastructure and improve the quality of water.

FDCVT Explanation of Proposed Expenditures 


Explanation of Proposed Expenditures 

The following expenditures represent the estimated costs of the Dupont Street Water Main Project 
based on a previous bid for services in 2014 by DiPonio Contracting, Inc. It must be noted that these 
costs represent an estimation by the contractor that is considered to be adequate to cover the 
Contractor's profit and overhead for the project. These costs may be adjusted once work begins. 

These items are essential for the successful implementation of the project, which include the removal 
and/or replacement of trees, sidewalk, driveways, areas of road, and parking lots as well as the 
excavation of the existing water main. Required items also include hydrant assemblies, connecting to 
the existing main, and equipment costs for traffic control.

Appendix C 
Estimated Savings 
of the 

Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Application 



Appendix C 

FDCVT Cost Savings Calculation 
Short Term Savings 

Another area of shortterm savings is considering the decline in water main breaks with an upgraded 
transmission line. In the past five years, there have been approximately twenty water main breaks in the 
area of the proposed work. Main breaks have cost the City between $5,000 and $10,000 each to repair. 
This has amounted to $100,000 to $200,000 in water main repair costs in just that area alone. On 
average we can expect a savings of $40,000 in the first year alone ($200,000/5 years = $40,000 per year) 

Long Term Savings 

The ultimate longterm benefits of the project are concerned with providing reliable, clean, and safe 
drinking water for Flint water customers. This area suffers from poor water quality due to longer 
retention times as a result of inhibited flow. Resolving this is essential to regain public confidence in City 
provided utilities, which affect bill collections and the overall fiscal health of the Water and Sewer Fund. 
Addressing antiquated infrastructure is a necessary step to secure public health. 

Other savings of this project include the elimination of leaks by replacing the line. Roughly one-third of 
the water that the City will be purchasing from Detroit will be lost due to leakage from an extremely 
antiquated system, the use of water when addressing incidents of arson, and water theft or waste from 
scrapping. Considering that water from DWSD will cost an estimated $1.5 million per month, $500,000 
worth of water that is purchased will never be billed every month. That amounts to $6 million per year 
and $30,000,000 per year if the pattern to repair these aging lines continues through completion. This is 
a significant waste. Replacing the Dupont Water Main is an essential step in mitigating this loss.

Evidence of Financial Distress: 

Deficit Elimination Plan 

for the 

Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Application 



EMERGENCY MANAGER 
CITY OF FLINT 

GENESEE COUNTY MICHIGAN 
ORDER No. 18 

ADOPTION OF THE DEFICIT ELIMINATION/RESERVE 
ACCUMULATION PLAN 

BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY VESTED IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGER 
("EMERGENCY MANAGER”) FOR THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN ("CITY”) 
PURSUANT TO MICHIGAN'S PUBLIC ACT 436 OF 2012, LOCAL FINANCIAL 
STABILITY AND CHOICE ACT, ("PA 436"); DARNELL EARLEY, THE EMERGENCY 
MANAGER, ISSUES THE FOLLOWING ORDER: 


Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager has broad powers in receivership to rectify the 
financial emergency and to assure the fiscal accountability of the City and its capacity to provide 
or cause to be provided necessary services essential to the public health, safety and welfare; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager acts in place of local officials, specifically the 
Mayor and City Council, unless the Emergency Manager delegates specific authority; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager shall develop and may amend a written financial 
and operating plan for the City, which shall have the objectives of assuring that the City is able 
to provide or cause to be provided governmental services essential to the public health, safety 
and welfare and assuring the fiscal accountability of the local government; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, an Emergency manager may require and approve or disapprove, or amend 
or revise, a plan for paying all outstanding obligations of the local government; and 

The FY13 Financial Statements for the City of Flint for FY13 disclosed a $12,895,642 General 
Fund deficit. Most of this deficit arises from various inter-fund borrowings in the form of cash 
advances to the General Fund from other funds, implemented over the past several years. The 
deficit has been significantly reduced from the FY1 2 deficit of $1 9.2 million. 


advances to the General Fund from other funds, implemented over the past several years. The 
deficit has been significantly reduced from the FY12 deficit of $19.2 million. 

This Order further reduces the deficit in FY14 and authorizes actions in subsequent years to 
eliminate the deficit. This Order is based on the commitment that in future years, expenses in the 
General Fund will not exceed revenues, thus assuring that the deficit will reduce, not grow. 

This Order also recognizes that achieving long term financial solvency requires not only the 
elimination of deficits but the accumulation of financial reserves at an adequate level. 

This Order recognizes reductions made or projected for this year and authorizes and directs 
additional steps to eliminate the deficit and to establish an appropriate level of reserves as 
necessary for sustainable financial solvency: 

• It is projected that the $12,895,642 General Fund deficit as of the end of FY13 will be 
reduced by $2,702,097 to $10,195,342 at the end of FY14, as a result of revenues 
exceeding expenses. 

• The General Fund debts to Fund 636 (Information Technology) and Fund 542 (Building 
Safety) in the total amount of $393,545 will be discharged before the end of FY14, thus 
further reducing the deficit to $9,800,000. Discharging these debts will not compromise 
the financial solvency of these funds. 

• $800,000 will be transferred from the Capital Improvements Fund to the Sewer Fund, and 
the General Fund debt to the Sewer Fund will be discharged in a like amount, thus 
reducing the General Fund deficit at the end of FY14 to $9,000,000. 

Continuing in the FY15 budget and future years, until the remaining accumulated deficit is 
eliminated, expenses will be budgeted at $1 million less than revenues, thus providing for 
additional deficit reduction. Additionally, $800,000 annually will be appropriated from the 
Public Improvement Fund for capital improvement funding in Fund 590 (Sewer Fund) in lieu of 
repayment of cash advances from Fund 590. Using these funds, deficit reduction will continue as 
follows: 

• FY15: $9,000,000 reduced to $7,200,000 

• FY16: $7,200,000 reduced to $5,400,000 

• FY17: $5,400,000 reduced to $3,600,000 

• FY18: $3,600,000 reduced to $1,800,000 

• FY19: $1,800,000 reduced to $ -0- 

Beginning in FY20, or sooner should the deficit be eliminated sooner, expenses in the General 
Fund will continue to be annually budgeted at a maximum of $1 million less than General Fund 
revenues, and expenses in the Public Improvement Fund shall continue to be budgeted at a 
maximum of $800,000 less than Public Improvement Fund revenues. This shall continue until, at 
a minimum, the accumulation of funds reach 15% of General Fund revenues. The goal is to have 
and maintain financial reserves equal to or exceeding 15% of General Fund revenues at any time.

These steps are to he viewed as the minimum actions to be taken with respect to eliminating the 
deficit and accumulating adequate financial reserves. It is recognized that accomplishing these 
goals as quickly as possible is desirable. 

Pursuant to Act 436, section 12(1), I hereby order that the General Fund debt associated with the 
cash advances to Funds 636, and 542 in the amounts of $500,000 and $110,000 respectively, are 
hereby discharged. 

I further order that the General Fund debt associated with the cash advance to Fund 591 in the 
amount of $1,000,000 will be repaid at the end of FY14 with the surplus of General Fund 
revenues over expenses budgeted for deficit reduction and that $800,000 will be appropriated 
from Fund 402 to Fund 590 for capital improvements, and that the General Fund debt associated 
with the cash advance from Fund 590 is hereby reduced by $800,000. 

I further order that the General Fund debt associated with the cash advances to Fund 590 
remaining after FY14 will be repaid in the amount of $1 million annually for each of the years 
FY15 through FY19 from the General Fund. Additionally, for the same period, there shall be an 
annual appropriation from the Public Improvement Fund in the amount of $800,000 to be used 
for capital improvements, and the General Fund debt associated with the cash advance from 
Fund 590 shall be reduced in a corresponding manner. 

I further order that once the deficit is eliminated, expenses in the General Fund shall continue to 
be annually budgeted at a maximum of $1 million less than General Fund revenues, and 
expenses in the Public Improvement Fund shall continue to be budgeted at a maximum of 
$800,000 less than Public Improvement Fund revenues until such time as the accumulation of 
funds from these actions reach, at a minim um 15% of General Fund revenues. The goal is to 
have and maintain financial reserves equal to or exceeding 15% of General Fund revenues at any 
time. Some portion of the funds accumulated by this action may be transferred to the City’s 
Budget Stabilization Fund, with no less than an amount equal to 5% of General Fund revenues 
remaining in the General Fund. 

I further order that the attached Deficit Elimination Plan is hereby adopted on behalf of the City 
of Flint. The Finance Director is authorized to take such actions and accounting measures as 
necessary to implement this order. 

The above stated orders are effective immediately. 

This Order may be amended, modified, repealed or terminated by any subsequent Order issued

Evidence of Financial Distress: 

Emergency Manager Exit Letter 

for the 

Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Application 




Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 

April 28, 2015 

Honorable Rick Snyder 1 

Governor of Michigan 

1 1 1 South Capitol Avenue I 

Lansing, Ml 48909 

Dear Governor Snyder: ' | 

The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in I 

November 2011. Since that time a number of substantia! changes have been implemented and I fee! that the 1 

financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position as 
Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, I was appointed Emergency Manager on January 1 3, 201 5, under the authority of PA | 

436 of2012, 1 am tire fourth EM to serve the City of Flint; my predecessors were Michael K. Brown (PA 4 | 

and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major steps 

toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and financial best 

practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and levels of service 

provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. I 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, characterized 
by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and unsustainable legacy 
costs. At the conclusion of FY 1 2, the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager was appointed, the City’s 
General Fund deficit stood at $19.1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8.8 million; and cash flow was 
$13 million, or less than one month’s expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street lighting; 
waste collection was changed to a fee for service from amillage rate; and increases in utility rates to among 
the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public

safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrunk by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General Fund 
deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan Board. 
City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have been 
enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the requirement 
for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and maintenance of a 
biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fiind balance reserve, 
including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a requirement to begin 
funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over daily 
activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City operations have 
been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no longer being done 
internally, 911 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 2015, and the City- 
funded 68 fi District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 67 a ‘ District Court in 
Januaiy, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the Karegondi Water Authority 
instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Collective bargaining contracts have also 
been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the stage for permanent reductions 
in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the level of parks maintenance. 
Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, with reduced assistance from 
the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private operators. 

• The City has put Into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new Master 
Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has been 
completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new zoning 
ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces significantly 
engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the Flint City 
Council, with the support of the Mayor. 


Governor Snyder 
April 28, 2015

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 20 14 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current Charter 
and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which will be 
elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current Strong Mayor 
form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 

Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work on 
the part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit over 
its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is currently 
operating under a judge’s order which allows modification of the City’s historical level of health 
care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 

• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flintnow provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a long 
term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently provides is 
not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint’s total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This millage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago, are 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety services, even with the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This was recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have, on average 100 more officers on the street than Flint does. 


Governor Snyder 
April 28, 2015 
Page 4 


• Equally important to providing State support in the form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City’s lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City’s 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 

Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of P.A. 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, I am prepared to say that I 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 2.1(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved, 1 recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. I believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to full local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 

If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are Ignored in favor of returning to the 
historic ways of doing business, it is not likely tire City will succeed over the long term. The focus of City 
leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 



Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

Appendix C 

FDCVT Cost Savings Calculation 
Short Term Savings 

Another area of shortterm savings is considering the decline in water main breaks with an upgraded 
transmission line. In the past five years, there have been approximately twenty water main breaks in the 
area of the proposed work. Main breaks have cost the City between $5,000 and $10,000 each to repair. 
This has amounted to $100,000 to $200,000 in water main repair costs in just that area alone. On 
average we can expect a savings of $40,000 in the first year alone ($200,000/5 years = $40,000 per year) 

Long Term Savings 

The ultimate long term benefits of the project are concerned with providing reliable, clean, and safe 
drinking water for Flint water customers. This area suffers from poor water quality due to longer 
retention times as a result of inhibited flow. Resolving this is essential to regain public confidence in City 
provided utilities, which affect bill collections and the overall fiscal health of the Water and Sewer Fund. 
Addressing antiquated infrastructure is a necessary step to secure public health. 

Other savings of this project include the elimination of leaks by replacing the line. Roughly one-third of 
the water that the City will be purchasing from Detroit will be lost due to leakage from an extremely 
antiquated system, the use of water when addressing incidents of arson, and water theft or waste from 
scrapping. Considering that water from DWSD will cost an estimated $1.5 million per month, $500,000 
worth of water that is purchased will never be billed every month. That amounts to $6 million per year 
and $30,000,000 per year if the pattern to repair these aging lines continues through completion. This is 
a significant waste. Replacing the Dupont Water Main is an essential step in mitigating this loss.

Schools and water testing update 


Hello All, 

I spoke with Madhu Anderson, Senior Policy Director for DEQ on the outreach to urban schools on water testing. I 
wanted to understand what DEQ's process was before we started canvassing, in case questions arose. George Krisztian, 
DEQ Lab Director and head of the Flint Action Response Team, suggested if possible that we hold off until they have a 
process and protocols in place on working with schools outside of the 13 Flint schools. They are working as quickly as 
possible with these 13 to establish some kind of response capability and backgrounder for all schools. They know, as we 
do, that this is most likely a statewide issue. Harvey, do you feel comfortable holding up on the calls to systems?

Your area is moving forward with schools testing water ahead of DEQ protocols. Grand Rapids is currently doing this and 
I'm told Muskegon will follow suit. I don't know what Holland is doing. hftp://rnlchig3nradio.org/rjost/grand-rapids-

Andrew, I need you to call call Benton Harbor, Kalamazoo and Battle Creek's superintendents and ask if they are 
planning water testing in their schools. If so, send send an email to DEQ Director Dan Wyant and copy me, Dennis 
Muchmore and Jarrod Agen. If not, don't worry about the communication. 

Bay City, Pontiac and Saginaw schools are moving forward. While DEQ is working on their protocols, a number of 
schools are moving forward with testing. I want the Governor informed about the activity. 

Remember, this is simply an inquiry to testing activity in urban districts.

Subject: RE: Update from Nick's calls 


Just a further follow up from this morning. 

Rep. Verhuelen is concerned about this being precedent setting and will we be on the hook if another major municipal 
water system fails. We talked quite a bit about water quality and corrosion and I hooked him up to Dan for further 
details. 

Rep. Santana thought this was the right thing to do and was quite supportive. He did state that he had heard that 
Hispanic people in Flint were not aware or taking advantage of the fact that they could get filters. I told him we would 
look at providing info in Spanish. He also urged that we work with the agencies that support Spanish speaking residents 
I told him I would follow up with Harvey to see what he is doing in that regard. Harvey - This is FYI for you. I will let him 
know that we were working with the Hispanic Center, who picked up filters from GCCARD and will help with translation 
on the application. 

Shirkey sent me a text thanking him for the message. 

»»»»»»»»»»> 


Nick has put in calls to our subcommittee chairs and wanted to pass along the feedback he got. 

All agree from the health side that the DHHS action is the right way to move forward. However they had some negative 
feedback on the $6 million. 

--Representatives MacGregor and Poleski both feel this should be a loan to the City of Flint instead of direct payment of 
$6 million 

--Senator Marleau complained about the lack of legislative input before the decision was made to switch back to Flint 
water from Detroit in the first place. 

He left messages for Verheulen, Santana, Shirkey and Hertel.

Frank: 

We have a situation in Flint, Michigan that is beginning to get national attention and could be an opportunity for Home 
Depot. 18 months ago, Flint switched its water supply from Detroit Water (the distance and pumping costs of going 
uphill made it quite expensive) to the Flint River as a temporary answer, until they could finish the construction to get 
their water from Lake Huron (Karagondi Water System). The corrosive attributes of the River water have exacerbated 
the lead deposit leaching into homeowner pipes and there is concern around lead poisoning, especially for infants. 

The corporate community is rallying to address the problem. Meijer donated 1500 water filters to low income residents 
and GM is about to announce a donation of between 5,000 and 10,000 filters. I do not yet know where GM is getting 
the filters from, but I was thinking that Home Depot might want to join the effort with a donation, supply chain 
discounting assistance, or some combination of activity that could help Flint residents. Harvey Hollins is our point 
person for this effort, since he is the Director of Urban Initiatives for Governor Snyder. I have copied him here. 

If you could get this into the hands of the right people and see if there is interest in speaking with Harvey, I would be 
very appreciative. Thanks and take care.

Frequently Asked Questions: 

Water Lead Levels in the City of Flint 
September 2015 


How can lead get into drinking water? 

Lead detections in Flint drinking water exist at the home level. Sampling at the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant has shown no lead in its treated water. However, this 
contaminant leaches into water from a home’s lead service lines, lead solder, and 
leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. 

Does the city meet federal drinking water standards for lead and copper? 

Yes, the city is meeting state and federal guidelines for lead and copper. 

The City of Flint has regularly monitored for lead and copper since federal law began 
requiring it in 1991 . 

When the City changed water sources in May 2014, state and federal law required the 
city to sample for lead and copper for a full year to determine how the water may be 
interacting with residential lead plumbing to increase lead levels. While the city’s results 
show residential lead levels below the federal threshold for immediate response 
activities, Flint is moving quickly to optimize corrosion control measures in its water 
system. 

Some individual homes showed high numbers for lead. Isn’t that a concern? 

For the homeowner, yes it is. There is no “safe” level for lead, and while the leading 
cause of lead poisoning around the country is lead paint, any source of lead ingestion is 
worthy of concern. 

But the State and federal guidelines for lead and copper acknowledge an important 
reality: Any home that has a lead service connection or lead plumbing will impart some 
varying amount of lead into the home’s water. The only way to eliminate lead in a home 
water system is to remove lead plumbing or replace lead service connections to the city 
system. 

The lead and copper rule requires the local operator to sample dozens, sometimes 
hundreds of homes in the service area to get a general sense of how the water supply is 
interacting with lead plumbing and service connections. The tests are done specifically 
at homes with lead service connections. Individual results vary and all participants are 


i 



Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure? 

The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout 
Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint. 

Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint 
changed its water source (May 2014 - April 201 5) showed no significant change in the 
pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data 
suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an 
increase in lead exposure throughout the community. 

How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem? 

Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90 th percentile calculation. If more 
than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a 
violation. It triggers other requirements which could include public notification, additional 
water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment. 

While some of Flint’s individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action 
level, compliance is based on the 90 ,h percentile of samples. The City of Flint’s 90 th 
percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 201 1 , and 15 parts 
per billion in 1992, but never exceeded the action level. 

The two most recent sampling periods, in 2014 and 2015, were 6 parts per billion and 
1 1 parts per billion, respectively. 

Did the city use every sample they got back? 

Sampling requirements for lead and copper are designed to target the most common 
pathways to lead ingestion in homes with the least protection. The sample must be 
collected from a commonly used kitchen or bathroom tap, and in accordance with the 
provided sampling instructions. Homes that employ filtration or additional treatment 
cannot be included. Samples must also be collected within the established monitoring 
period. 

I have a lead service connection or lead plumbing. What should I do? 

Replacement is the only way to eliminate lead exposure. However, here are some 
interim steps homeowners can take to reduce it: 

Flush pipes before drinking, and only use cold water for consumption. 

The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may 
contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer, 
"flush" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This 
could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home, 
such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer. 

Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making 
baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels of lead. 


2 



Who is responsible for replacement of leaded materials? 

Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials 
within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility. The City of Flint owns the service 
pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility. 
This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house 
is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner. 

Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines? 

Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make 
the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated 
effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels. 

What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment? 

The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal 
corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years. 

However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized 
Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months. 

What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year? 

The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior 
to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by 
KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and 
copper sampling every six months. Additionally, the city’s water treatment plant will 
continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment. 

How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint? 

The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these 
connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it 
would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work. 

What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house? 

Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to 
$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as 
well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered. 

With more than 15,000 lead service lines at an estimated average cost of $4,000 for 
each replacement, total cost could be $60 million or more.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint background information 
September 24, 2015 

• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

• All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 

• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 



WIC Children 


• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

City of Flint 

September 5 th 2014 Boil Water Advisory Review 


OVERVIEW 

o On Friday September 5 th the City of Flint issued a boil water advisory to residents 
in two of ten test areas around the city. 

o The advisory was due to multiple positive tests for “total coliform” and the area 
covered approximately 9 square miles. 

° On Sunday September 7 th the City expanded the advisory to include another of 
the ten test areas due to a subsequent positive test. 

o The boil water advisories were lifted on Tuesday September 9 th at 5:00 after 
consultation with the DEQ. 


BACKGROUND 

■ State of Michigan Regulations requires that the City of Flint Water Treatment 
Plant perform testing of its water distribution system on a routine basis in ten 
different locations around the City. 

■ The tests take twenty four hours to produce valid results and are sent directly to 
the Department of Environmental Quality for review. 

■ Test results which show positive for “Ecoli” or “fecal coliform” trigger boil water 
notices for the test area and the advisories usually remain in effect until three 
consecutive tests return negative results. 

■ A single positive test for “total coliform” does not generally result in a boil water 
advisory, rather it indicates that the environment is conducive for bacteria. 

■ Typically, investigation into possible causes followed by corrective measures 
such as flushing the affected area with open hydrants will cleanse the system. 

■ This process is overseen by an employee who is required to hold an F-1 State 
License and is listed as the Operator in Charge of the Water Plant and an 
employee who holds an S-1 State License which is required to maintain 
distribution systems of this municipal size. 

■ The City of Flint has over 500 miles of pipe in its distribution system, much of 
which is over 70 years old. 

■ The City of Flint has over ten-thousand valves throughout its distribution system. 

■ The City of Flint has a professional reliability study of its system, that was 
updated in December 2013. 


PROBLEM 



❖ After detecting the initial positive test for total coliform, normal procedures did not 
clear the condition and multiple positive tests ensued. 

❖ The continued positive total coliform tests were the cause for issuing the boil 
water notice. 

❖ Additional discoveries showed that residual chlorine levels in the affected area 
were considerably lower than normal. 


SOLUTION 

S On Monday September 8 th the City convened all licensed personnel, Utility 
Supervisors, and DPW Director to a single meeting location and held a 
brainstorming session with the DEQ on conference call. 

S It was agreed that while not totally isolated, the concern was mainly present in a 
specific large transmission line that ran through all positive testing areas. 

S It was determined to expand the hydrant flushing outside of the immediate impact 
area. 

v" It was found that a 24” valve which feeds this transition main was broken in the 
OFF position outside of the immediate impact area. 

S The broken valve was preventing fresh water from being pushed directly into the 
impacted area while causing water to travel from the water plant around the 
entire city and preventing adequate circulation of fresh water. 

•s In repairing the broken valve, virtually all of the symptoms were erased over a 24 
hour period and the chlorine count has steadily risen back to normal levels 
throughout the transmission main. 


CONCLUSION 

S The City was in direct contact with DEQ personnel daily. 
s The positive tests were for “total coliform” only. 

S The following statement about total coliform was approved by the DEQ and made 
in writing to the public as part of the recent boil water. 


Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Coliforms are bacteria 
which are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that 
other, potential ly-h armful, bacteria may be present. 

Usually, coliforms are a sign that there could be a problem with the treatment or 
distribution system (pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we 
do follow-up testing to see if other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coliform 
or E. coli, are present. We did not find any of these bacteria in our subsequent 



testing. If we had, we would have notified you immediately. However, we are still 
finding conforms in the drinking water. 


S The City of Flint is in the first year of strategic budgetary investment in an 
infrastructure strategy. 

■S The City of Flint infrastructure strategy has been, and will continue to be 
developed with state licensed employees, industry experts, and proven 
experienced consultants.

You may have already seen this (below) blurb from MLive. Also, I had a call from Jerry A. He

I have also attached a table Wayne’s & Jerry's staff put together. My sense is there is still this

is not the case. The info is consistent with we sent you the other day i.e., there is an estimated 30%

Robert W. Bowcock, founder of Integrated Iiiiiiii Management, met with Mayor Dayne Walling, 
Councilman Wantwax Davis and others 

Boweoek said earlier this week that he believes small treatment and distribution adjustments could 
help tlx some of Flinlb water quality problems f& toured lire city's water treatment plant Friday. 
Walling declined to comment on his conversation with Bowcock, but city Councilman Eric Mays said 
he is anxious to hear his assessment and recommendations. 


1 



Davis said Bowcock was straightforward in giving his opinion that the city can cut back on some of the 
chemicals being used to treat water. 

City spokesman Jason Lorenz issued a statement, saying, "The city of Flint honored a request for a 
tour of its water treatment plant submitted by Mr. Bowcock, as it has done with individuals and 
groups in the past. 

"(Director of Public Works) Director Howard Croft and F-i Licensed Treatment Operator Mike 
Glasgow guided the tour and answered all of Mr. Bowcock's questions. Tours of the Water Treatment 


Plant can be arranged by appointment for interested groups by calling 810-787-6537." 

Bowcock is scheduled to join in a march for water quality through downtown Flint, which is planned 
to begin at 1 pan, Saturday at Flint City Hall, 1101 S. Saginaw St., and end at The Durant. 

Bowcock is also scheduled to speak at a forum at the Saints of God Church, 2200 Forest Hill Ave., 
Flint, from 3-4:15 pan. 

Brockovich, portrayed by Julia Roberts in a 2000 movie about her fight over the pollution of a 


California town, has been speaking out on Facebook about Flint’s water issues for several weeks. 
Today, she posted a photo of Bowcock, Davis and march organizer Melissa Mays inside the Flint water- 
plant, saying she was "so honored this community would seek my help ... and I am glad I could send 
Bob to get, it done." 

In addition to customer complaints about the price and quality of the ’water-, there were several boil 


water advisories in Flint in 2014 and the city was found in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act for 


excess total trihalomethan.es in the water supply last year. 


The city began using the Flint River as its source of drinking water in April after 50 years of handling 


only the distribution of already- treated Lake Huron water purchased from the Detroit Water and 


Sewerage Department. 

Since that time, some citizens and members of the City Council have advocated abandoning the use of 
the river and purchasing lake water from the Detroit until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is 
complete. 

The city and Genesee County are partners in the KWA.

Actually, my quick take is about 8%. 

Some background: 

When Flint left, the annual revenue profile for the Water System was initially reduced by $12.5 
million, However, we immediately recalculated the rate for Genesee County (recognizing their 
higher demands), to effectively "claw back" about $2 million of the reduction, so the net Flint 
impact is ~ $10.5 million, or just under 2.5% of the (reduced) Water System rate 
revenue. Assuming that same amount could be replaced, and all else being equal, the "system 
rate increase" could be reduced by about 3 percent, with a bit more of the reduction occurring 
in the suburban wholesale rate structure. Safe to say that (again, absent any other changes) 
the average suburban water rate increase would be closer to 8 percent compared to the 
current 11.1%. 

Hope this helps . . .

Tom, 

What are the total revenues collected from water and sewer rates for the following months: 9/14, 10/14, 1 1/14, 
12/14? 

To get a handle on the last table you sent Friday that was attached to your communication below, I attached an 
excel spreadsheet to help me understand this better. The yellow highlighted cell is where I need data filled in. I 
broke up the potential reduction ($3m and $8. 4m) and spread them into the monthly and annual even though is 
sounds like the $8.4 million for professional services is a one-time or short-term expense. The pink highlight is 
the % increase in rates base on the table you sent last Friday which is different from the 24% rate increase I 
calculated. . . so where did I error? 

Assuming there are fixed costs in the current rates via the Flint river, what are they?

FLINT, MI — A water quality expert who hlM pMlipiBSi etf with enwronmenlalist Erin 



help fix mint of Flints water quality prob!elli|||lllllli|plqyity a water treatment plant Friday. 
Walling declined to comment on his conversation with Bowcock, but city Councilman Eric Mays said 


he is anxious to hear his assessment and recommendations. 

Davis said Bowcock was straightforward in giving his opinion that the city can cut back on some of the 
chemicals being used to treat water. 

City spokesman Jason Lorenz issued a statement, saying, "The city of Flint honored a request for a 
tour of its water treatment plant submitted by Mr. Bowcock, as it has done with individuals and 
groups in the past, 

"(Director of Public Works) Director Howard Croft and F-i Licensed Treatment Operator Mike 
Glasgow' guided the tour and answered all of Mr. Bowcock’s questions. Tours of the Water Treatment 
Plant can be arranged by appointment for interested groups by calling 810-787-6537." 

Bowcock is scheduled to join in a march for water quality through downtown Flint, which is planned 
to begin at 1 p.m. Saturday at Flint City Hall, 1101 S. Saginaw St., and end at The Durant. 

Bowcock is also scheduled to speak at a forum at the Saints of God Church, 2200 Forest Hill Ave., 
Flint, from 3-4:15 p.m, 

Broekovich, portrayed by Julia Roberts in a 2000 movie about her fight over the pollution of a 
California town, has been speaking out on Facebook about Flint’s water issues for several weeks. 


2 



Today, she posted a photo of Bowcock, Davis and march organizer Melissa Mays inside the Flint water 
plant, saying she was "so honored this community would seek my help ... and I am glad I could send 
Boh to get it done." 

In addition to customer complaints about the price and quali ty of the water, there were several boil 
water advisories in Flint in 2014 and the city was found in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act for 
excess total trihalomethanes in the water supply last year. 

The city began using the Flint River as its source of drinking water in April after 50 years of handling 
only the distribution of already-treated Lake Huron water purchased from the Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department, 

Since that time, some citizens and members of the City Council have advocated abandoning the use of 
the river and purchasing lake water from the Detroit until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline is 
complete. 

The city and Genesee County are partners in the KWA.

When Flint left, the annual revenue profile for the Water System was initially reduced by $12.5

higher demands), to effectively "claw back" about $2 million of the reduction, so the net Flint

RE: Flint Water Cost Analysis 


Ms. Murphy, 

Thank you. The calculations in the table was provided by treasury and ! was seeking clarification. I am not a water 
expert, but I learned that typically, most rates have two components. 


1, Fixed-cost recovery charge 

This charge is based on the size of the water meter at the home or business. Most residential customers will 
have a meter between 5/8 lh 's of an inch and 1 inch. 


2. Consumption Charge 

This charge is based on the amount of water used. The rate for usage is determined by the distance and 
elevation of the home or business from the water source. 


MCF is used in many place for calculating rates; however, since Flint is currently not using this calculation, what are the 
cost components that make up the $149 avg. monthly charge to the resident? 

Best, 

Harvey

Jerry Ambrose asked me to respond to your request for more information on the Flint water cost analysis chart 
which you sent him yesterday. Please see the attached chart; it contains an added analysis by Jerry. The sections 
for which you asked for data can not be provided as we don't calculate prices in the manner you are comparing. 

Jerry's chart clearly represents what Flint has been talking about - a major increase in water rates would be 
necessary to pay the additional charge to purchase DWSD water.

Glad to know that you have agreed to participate on the Advisory Committee. We have more than 40 
individuals who have agreed to participate. 

We extended an invitation to Rev. Harris as head of the Concerned Pastors on February 16. However, we did

including Rev. Harris. Can you confirm that Rev. Harris received the invitation and whether or not he or his

attachments Ed Koryzno sent again are helpful. One was the list of members in the new Water Advisory Committee and 
the second was the interim report from Veiola. Wayne

Brad, 



Per Monday's conference call, when can we expect to receive DEQ's review of the home filter units. Also, of the total 
notices/citations issued by DEQ to communities regarding drinking water around the state, what percent was issued to 
Flint in 2013 and 2104.

Fwd: Tap Filters 


Harvey, 

Since group call Tuesday I have been working out how the filter idea might take shape. 

To reiterate some key points so we’re all clear: 

1. DEQ does not inspect individuals’ homes in a situation like this. It's the city’s 
system, their operators handle all complaints and maintenance. In fact, our folks 
alerted me that the city’s got union rules in place forbidding any contractor from 
touching the system. 

2 . DEQ’s role is limited to ensuring the plant is operating to state standards and the 
water it produces meets potability standards. The aesthetic issues drawing 
concern from residents - color, odor, taste - stem from a variety of things. Age of 
the system and prolonged lack of upkeep is the leading factor. But in some 
areas, another contributing factor is changes in water flow - source used to come 
from the south, now comes from the north, so some pipes are flowing in reverse, 
stirring up whatever was settled for a long time. In some sections, large pipes 
that historically served large communities are now serving a much smaller 
customer base, contributing to water stagnating in the system. In some areas, 
household connections are old and worn, so two neighbors may be having 
dramatically different experiences. My point is, the challenge takes many forms 
and there’s no single solution that will bring sweeping change. The two 
consultants hired by the city have, as I understand it, both reinforced this idea in 
their assessments, so that’s good. 

3. The fix for this will be years in the making, truly. Even if full funding were 
available, ‘big dig' projects can’t all happen at once. The city needs to get an 
assessment of its infrastructure so it can prioritize its needs, and I understand 
they’re working on that. In the near term, maintenance this spring / summer - 
things like cleaning the pipes in key sections and flushing the system via the 


i 



hydrants - could offer some short term results. I know nobody wants to just wait 
for spring, but that is something important to keep in mind. 

4. in the meantime, the group discussed possibly making home water filters 
available somehow. The National Safety Foundation is a Michigan company, 
headquartered and founded in Ann Arbor, that, develops standards for all kinds of 
infrastructure. They’re a globally recognized source for standard setting. A look at 
their site reveals there are myriad filtration options on the market and within each 
type (faucet mounted, whole house line filters, etc) there are filters that focus on 
different aspects of purification. 

If this idea begins to get legs, I’d suggest testing some different models on the 
local water at the customer level to see if they work. I’d also suggest the idea be 
focused on tap-mounted models to promote clean, appealing drinking water. And 
I’d suggest this program could be funded in whole or in part by the state, but 
would need to be administered by the city (reinforcing the fact that they own, 
operate and service the system). I’ve got some information on filter models 
below. 

Two more considerations: One, while the state has provided residents in some 
communities with bottled water in the past, it always has to do with their water 
being somehow contaminated - as in, some kind of chemical plume that 
impaired local drinking water sources. This would be the first time the state took 
steps to deal with what is an aesthetic issue on a system where the water is 
meeting state drinking water standards. 

Water filter info: 

ANSI NSF Standard 42 Covers bacteriostasis, taste and odor (associated only with chlorine 
removal), and other aesthetic conditions 

http://standards.nsf.org/apDS/qroup public/downioad.php/1 9895/NSF 42-1 1 %2Q- 
%20watermarked. pdf 

ANSI NSF Standard 53 Covers health effects removal 

http://standards.nsf.org/apps/group public/downjoad.php/19S96/NSF 53-1 1a%20- 
%20watermarked. pdf 

It is important to note that the filters are not required to meet all aspects of the standard, only 
the portions they want to make claims for. So product information for each filter must be 
reviewed to determine its applicability. 

Most of these point of use filters are basic activated carbon filters that simply remove taste and 
odor specifically associated with chlorine, not other things like iron, manganese, hydrogen 
sulfide, etc. that can also impact taste and odor as well as color. 

It is important to recognize that taste and odor is generally an individual preference and such 
standards have for the most part not been developed because groups of individuals may still 
consider taste and odor issues to exist even after levels for such a standard have been met. 

Other considerations are that the test water for such filters attempting to meet the standard uses 
hardness levels of 170 mg/L or less. Flint’s water at times may be above this level, which could 
then impact filter performance and longevity. 


2 



Most of these filters are designed to be replaced after 100 gallons or less of use, a period of 
about 3 months for most households. In addition the tests allow for initial pressure drops of up 
to 15 psi. This may limit use in households that already rely on minimum pressure within their 
household plumbing. 

Regarding the health effects standards, as the Flint water system already meets such 
requirements, with the exception of the current TTHM locational running annual average, there 
is little point to the use of these filters for such a purpose. 

To the point you'd asked about the other day, while Flint and Detroit are leading 
examples of unmaintained infrastructure, Flint is not alone by any means.

Lists Michigan with a $13.8 Billion need over the next 20 years. 


http://www.infrastructurereportcard.Org/a/#p/state-facts/michigan 


Here’s a link to the 2009 Report Card for Michigan Infrastructure 

http://vyww.michiqanreportcard.com/ 


From the report: 

“A significant portion of the state’s primary distribution system is nearing 100 years old. 
CWS are facing a significant challenge to maintain the vast network of aging, 
underground infrastructure. Within the city of Detroit alone, approximately 80% of its 
distribution piping was installed prior to 1940, which is not unusual for CWS in 
Michigan.” 

“The age of the majority of the state's distribution system is the primary contributor to 
normal decay and failure. In many cases, pipe life has far exceeded useful service life. 
Much of the older water systems consist of undersized mains constructed of materials 
such as unlined cast iron pipe. Minor fluctuations in system flows or pressure may 
cause red water complaints and even result in pipe failure. All CWS should have routine 
flushing and valve maintenance programs; however many are hesitant due to the time 
and cost.” 

“Under the Stage 2 Disinfection Byproducts Rule, all CWS that disinfect are required to 
provide increased trihalomethane (THHM) and haloacetic acid (HAAS) monitoring due 
to the potential byproducts of chlorine reactions within the pipe system. Corrosion, 
scale, solid suspension on the interior sidewall of pipe, in addition to the age and 
condition of the system will require diligent rehabilitation investment to maintain system 
integrity.” 

“While better materials and advanced technology is available to replace the aging 
distribution system, resources remain scarce when compared with the magnitude of the 
rehabilitation task at hand. Too often, distribution system replacement costs are 
underfunded and the first item to be slashed when budget problems arise. Overall, 
distribution system maintenance is reactionary in much of the older systems. Since the 
majority of the antiquated system will require removal and replacement beyond the 

3 



CVVS funding resources for systematic upgrade, a reactionary rehabilitation program is 
inevitable and must be funded accordingly.”

HomnioGlobal Ozone 


disinfectio. . . 


Brad Wurfel, Director of Communications (DEQ) 


l 




Today about 98% of water treatment facilities in the U.S. use some form of chlorine to disinfect 
drinking water supplies. It is a cost effective method for destroying potentially harmful bacteria 
and viruses. However, chlorine’s ability to interact with organic compounds in water leads to 
trihalomethanes (THMs) formation. Especially, river or lake water with high level of organic 
matter require heavy chlorination to combat high level of bacteria, resulting in dangerous levels 
of THMs and bad smell. THMs, when ingested can encourage the growth of free radicals that 
can destroy or damage vital cells in the body. Besides cancer, exposure to THMs has been 
linked to other health issues including asthma, eczema, heart disease and higher miscarriage 
and birth defect rates. Further, high level of chlorine also poses serious risk to the aging 
infrastructure. 

Chemical free water disinfection technologies such as UV light and ozone have long been 
recognized to be much safer than chlorination, however, their high cost has prevented wider 
adoption. The basic mechanism of ozone 
generation and disinfection is shown in 
the picture. Ozone has a high oxidation 
potential (much higher than chlorine) and 
a superior response time compared to 
other sanitizing products. Its high 
oxidizing potential enables ozone to break 
down organic matters that chlorine 
cannot. Some pollutants can only be 
oxidized by ozone. For example, Cryptosporidium Parvum, a drinking water pollutant, is 
resistant to most disinfectants, but is effectively destroyed by ozone. Most importantly, the 
emission from ozone is pure oxygen and it leaves no residues. 

UV light is a competing non-chemical sterilization technique. Intense UV rays break down the 
sensitive RNA and/or DNA of microorganisms, thus preventing the organism from reproducing. 
Ozone, on the other hand, oxidizes the microorganisms, thus destroying their cells completely. 
UV sterilization being a line of sight process, to be effective, one needs to remove most of the 
suspended matter prior to the treatment. In contrast, ozone oxidizes the soil or particulate 
matter, changing or destroying the chemistry of the soiling materials such as organic 
compounds. 

Despite the great benefits of ozone, its widespread adoption is limited due to the high total 
ownership cost of current commercial ozone generators. Somnio’s AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator is 
a paradigm shift in ozone generation technology. The first and only commercial barrier less 
ozone generator eliminates the requirement of dielectric barriers and highly filtered dried oxygen 
(pure or enriched) supplies, which restrain current commercial ozone generators. This 
groundbreaking technology brings a market-competitive, robust, energy efficient, and scalable 
modular device that offers a financially attractive alternative with the capability of producing 
varying levels of ozone depending on the application at hand. 

Producing ozone cost effectively is only part of the greater story of the far reaching benefits of 
ozone. Applying ozone effectively for a given application requires careful and intelligent design, 
sensing and monitoring. In addition to its revolutionary AiR 2 0 3 ™ ozone generator, Somnio 


Gas Discharge 



collaborates with end users to provide complete and economical turnkey solutions. Somnio’s 
current in-house test plant incorporates all necessary safety features and automation.

For Immediate Release 

Water Advisory Committee to Hold Second Meeting at Flint Public Library on Thursday, March 19, 2015 
Flint, Michigan - March 17, 2015 - The Water Advisory Committee formed to help aid in communication between the 
City and the community is holding its second meeting on Thursday, March 19, 2015 from 2:00-4:00pm at the Flint Public 
Library. The committee will be updated on the current status of improvements to the water system, the next steps to be 
taken including cost and timing estimates and formatted responses to questions asked at the previous meeting. In 
addition, the committee will be provided with a comprehensive budget overview with clear cost breakdowns. 

The purpose of the Water Advisory Committee is to provide the community with ongoing information on the City's work 
to maintain a safe water supply and to improve quality. In addition to gathering information from the City to share 
during their interactions with the community, committee members will also be expected to share the concerns they 
receive from the community in order for those concerns to be addressed. 

All meetings by the Water Advisory Committee will be open to the public and will be held at easily accessible locations 
throughout the city. Meetings will be held on a regular basis as work continues at least until the City is receiving its 
water from the Karegnondi Water Authority, which is anticipated to be in 2016. 

Any group who has not received an invitation and who would like to have a member participate can send a request to 

mayorgpcityofflint.com .

The steps outlined in the comprehensive action plan are still in effect. 



FAQs for Media Q&As 


Switch to Great Lakes Water Authority 

What finally pushed the state to this decision? 

This was the City's request, and the Governor supports it, based on several key factors: 

In the near term, DWSD water will be easier to manage. It comes from a more stable source than the river, it is fully 
optimized for corrosion control, and it is clear that residents of Flint have more confidence in this water source. 

Will this solve Flint's water crisis? 

In combination with the other short term, intermediate term and long-term steps outlined last week, this move 
represents a big step forward. Flint still has serious system maintenance challenges it must address. 

If you're saying residents will still have lead because of their plumbing, does that mean every other city in this state 
has a lead problem? 

Many areas of the state have lead in their infrastructure mix. 

Where's the state getting the money to fund this? 

We have submitted a formal request to lawmakers via the appropriations process. 

Where's the city getting the money to fund this? 

The city is contributing all it can, and is getting assistance for its match from the Mott Foundation. 

How long will the switch take? 

The switch will be completed by the City and Great lakes Water Authority, but our understanding is that it can be 
accomplished in the very near term once the arrangements are complete. 

How long will it take before Detroit's corrosion controls provide protection for Flint? 

It will take some time for the corrosion control additives to build on pipe walls throughout the system. Estimates vary. 
The state can assure we will commence monitoring of the system early 2016 and report results as we get them to keep 
the community updated. 

Why do residents still need to use filters and bottled water? 

The filters and bottled water are responsible precautions for any resident concerned about lead exposure. 

Do the filters actually work? We've been hearing they don't protect for lead. 

Yes, the filters work. They are all certified for lead removal by the National Sanitation Foundation. 

The filters are only good for 100 gallons. What happens when they are used up? 

They will need to be replaced. And residents can get a new filter. 

What about restaurants? 

What's going to be done about lead service lines? 

Long term, this is the only permanent solution to lead exposure. The state has committed to helping the city accomplish 
this goal long term. 




Do you wish you'd made this switch sooner? 

We support the City's decision. We can't look backward. We feel the state has responded quickly and effectively as 
information has surfaced, been investigated and verified. While the City of Flint is, right now, in compliance with the 
federal Lead and 

Copper Rule, we recognize there is a disparity between surveillance testing and other testing happening in the 
community that we need to better understand and we are working on developing our knowledge. 

Schools testing 

What do these results say? 

The results say we need to further investigate Flint schools and help the schools find clearer causes for some the results 
we got. 

Any theories about what's going on? 

It is possible there are specific points in the plumbing that have lead components which need to be replaced, but we 
can't say anything definitively until we perform an investigation at each school. 

Do the schools have lead service lines? If not, why are they getting such high results? 

The schools we tested initially do not have lead service lines. There are a few possible reasons why lead is being 
detected at specific points in the buildings and not others. When we know things definitively, we will make the 
information public. 

How long do the schools have to stay on bottled water? Just until the switch to Detroit, or longer term? 

We are encouraging the schools to continue their current protective measures as a precaution until we can get into the 
buildings and get more answers. 

Why did you only test 13 schools? 

That was what the Flint Public Schools requested. 

What happens to other schools? 

We will test all the schools in Flint if they request it. 

What about the schools that can't afford to update their entire plumbing systems? 

This is why we are having plumbing assessments completed. There is no way to know yet what each building will 
require. 

How confident are you in your testing? You've got results all over the map. 

We are confident that our testing meets the requirements for the federal Lead and Copper Rule, which is surveillance 
monitoring. The bigger question is whether surveillance monitoring meets the public health protection standards that 
Lead Exposure Testing methods do. The EPA is working on that question now, and we are engaged in that dialogue. 

What do you mean by "health exposure testing"? What are you doing next? 


The 90 th percentile of your results is still below 15 ppb. Does that make you more or less confident in your testing and 
in your protocols? 



It makes us confident that the testing protocol delivers consistent results. But again, it does raise questions about 
whether this testing method shows what people think it does or what they really want to know, which is actual lead 
exposure from lead plumbing in a home. 

Any idea how long kids have been exposed to lead? Was it before the move to the Flint River? 

That is possible. We don't know. 

How does the state bring this new information into the broader picture of kids' lead exposure across the state?

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure 
monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer. 


INSERT MAYOR QUOTE HERE 





The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from 
large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, 
the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using 
phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

INSERT MOTT FOUNDATION QUOTE HERE 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four 
locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents 
who have questions about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will 
be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. on Saturday. 

Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap 
and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 1 5 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at

Frank: 

We have a situation in Flint, Michigan that is beginning to get national attention and could be an opportunity for Home Depot. 18 
months ago, Flint switched its water supply from Detroit Water (the distance and pumping costs of going uphill made it quite 
expensive) to the Flint River as a temporary answer, until they could finish the construction to get their water from Lake Huron 
(Karagondi Water System). The corrosive attributes of the River water have exacerbated the lead deposit leaching into homeowner 
pipes and there is concern around lead poisoning, especially for infants. 

The corporate community is rallying to address the problem. Meijer donated 1500 water filters to low income residents and GM is 
about to announce a donation of between 5,000 and 10,000 filters. I do not yet know where GM is getting the filters from, but I was 
thinking that Home Depot might want to join the effort with a donation, supply chain discounting assistance, or some combination of 
activity that could help Flint residents. Harvey Hollins is our point person for this effort, since he is the Director of Urban Initiatives 
for Governor Snyder. I have copied him here. 

If you could get this into the hands of the right people and see if there is interest in speaking with Harvey, I would be very 
appreciative. Thanks and take care.

Frank, 

Received your email from Craig. We would be glad to help. 

Can you provide any additional information on fdter sizes needed in the area and quantity you might be looking for? 
We are also going to look to donate bottled water if that makes sense?

Dear Governor Snyder: 

We want to thank you for the recent conference call between members of the Flint Water Advisory Task Force 
(FWATF), yourself, and members of your administration. Attached is a follow-up letter to that conference call 
outlining an initial set of recommendations that we believe should be implemented in the very near future to 
focus the state's efforts to protect the public health in Flint. 

We both acknowledge and appreciate your personal interest in this issue and your commitment, not only to 
assisting the Task Force in our review, but— most importantly— to ensuring that the full measure of state 
resources are brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully, 

Ken Sikkema

December 7, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with representatives of 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Michigan Department of Health 
and Fluman Services ( M DH HS) to discuss elements of the 10-point Action Plan designed to address 
various issues related to the ongoing public health protection challenges precipitated by lead in the Flint 
water supply. These discussions were held at our request as part of our task to make recommendations 
to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing mitigation efforts. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force 
participated in a conference call with yourself, members of the Administration, and representatives of 
these agencies to discuss the progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other 
related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Flealth Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing. We will continue to assess state and local efforts and make recommendations regarding 
specific steps that we believe are warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates 
responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to 
facilitate this larger framework, which should address the following: 

1. The need for MDFIFIS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for 
contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups 
regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— potentially independent of any one 
particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you, Governor— be established to 
provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. 
For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports on the 
goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health 
providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as 
well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the 
development of that dashboard. 



We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in 
communication on this issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested 
dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance of our final report, we would like to ensure the 
independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding 
community trust in state actions. 

We appreciate your personal interest in this issue, commitment to assisting the Task Force in our 
review, and— most importantly— commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are 
brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully yours,

Primary Prevention 


“Because no measurable level of blood lead is 
known to be without deleterious effects, and 
because once engendered, the effects appear to 
be irreversible in the absence of any other 
interventions, public health, environmental and 
housing policies should encourage PREVENTION 
of all exposure to lead.”

Prevention.” 2012 CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention.

Fwd: Water Donation 

FYI. 



Are you hearing that the new Mayor wants to declare a local emergency on this water issue? 

The below article is reference the water we were able to identify from FEMA. 

Emergency Management/Preparedness Sector 

FEMA Sends 28.000 Liters of Bottled Water to Flint amid Lead Troubles 
( MLive ) 

Flint, Michigan: The federal government is helping to replenish the bottled water supply in Flint. Two trucks 
delivered about 28,000 liters of water from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the Food Bank of 
Eastern Michigan today, Dec. 14. The water will then be donated to "partner agencies" in the city of Flint who 
will distribute the water to residents. Cassie Ringsdorf, a FEMA spokeswoman, said the agency maintains 
commodity stockpiles at warehouses around the country and makes them available. "These commodities are 
available for use, within hours, should an incident occur that requires support from FEMA," Ringsdorf said in 
an email to The Flint Journal-MLive. A news release from the Food Bank credited Michigan State Police Lt. 
Billie Jo Roach with having identified the availability of the water from FEM A. Flint remains in a public health 
emergency and officials have said residents should not drink unfiltered tap water because of rising lead levels 
while the city used the Flint River as its water source from April 2014 until October 2015. The Journal could 
not immediately reach a representative of the MSP Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division 
for further comment. FEMA said the Food Bank claimed two truckloads of water and agreed to pay all 
transportation costs associated with the donation.

Flint Water Advisory Task Force Initial Recommendations 

Lansing, MI— The Flint Water Advisory Task Force today released a letter recently 
sent to Governor Rick Snyder, and the Governor's response, regarding initial 
recommendations to address health protection challenges with the Flint water 
supply. Copies of the letters are attached. 

"We felt it was imperative to make these initial recommendations to help address 
the water crisis in Flint instead of waiting until our final report is submitted," said 
FWATF Co-Chair Chris Kolb. "We appreciate the prompt acceptance of our request 
for action by the Governor and see it as a step forward." 

"The Task Force has been holding a number of fact finding interviews with 
individuals and groups that have pertinent information about what happened in 


i 





Flint," FWATF Co-Chair Ken Sikkema stated. "While the Task Force is far from 
done with our work, the initial review has presented a very disturbing situation 
that will require many actions to help those that have suffered. We saw no reason 
to wait until the final report to make these initial recommendations. We also 
anticipate that we will made additional recommendations prior to the final 
report." 

The FWATF letter included in part: 

"One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to 
be taking place in the absence of a larger project coordination framework that 
measures results and clearly delineates responsibilities for continuing actions to 
protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to facilitate this 
larger framework, which should address the following: 

1. The need for MDHFIS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to 
set goals for actions in collaboration with local and federal agencies and 
organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely 
fashion and for contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and 
stakeholder groups regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— potentially 
independent of any one particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this 
Task Force and you. Governor— be established to provide effective coordination of 
ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. For this, we 
also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports 
on the goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint 
community, public health providers, and state agencies to know about the status 
of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as well as promote coordination and 
accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the development of that 
dashboard." 


The full FWATF report is expected to be completed in early 2016. 

Members of the Task Force include: 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine 
at the University of Michigan Health System and professor of public policy at the 
Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 
2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of 
Public Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan 
Department of Community Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide 
coalition of 70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. 
Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six 


2 



years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president 
of the MEC for six years. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of 
the Mott Children's Health Center. He received his medical degree from Howard 
University College of Medicine and has been in practice for 36 years. He has 
served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan 
Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his 
humanitarian and advocacy efforts on behalf of children from the Community 
Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the 
Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, 
Alabama's rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the 
county's bankruptcy and issuance of $1.7 billion in sewer warrants and led 
strategic financial planning for the City of Atlanta's Department of Watershed 
Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, wastewater and 
stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the 
firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with 
four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

The FWATF was formed by Governor Snyder to review actions regarding the Flint 
water system and offer recommendations both for Flint and Michigan to protect 
the health and safety of state residents.

December 7, 2015 


Dear Governor Snyder: 


On Wednesday, November 18, 2015, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with representatives of 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Michigan Department of Health 
and Fluman Services (MDHHS) to discuss elements of the 10-point Action Plan designed to address 
various issues related to the ongoing public health protection challenges precipitated by lead in the Flint 
water supply. These discussions were held at our request as part of our task to make recommendations 
to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere, and also to monitor ongoing mitigation efforts. 

Subsequent to those meetings, on Tuesday, November 24, 2015, members of the Task Force 
participated in a conference call with yourself, members of the Administration, and representatives of 
these agencies to discuss the progress to date on the 10-point Action Plan, as well as several other 
related issues. 

We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan, 
specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children, communication 
with health care providers in the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead, and 
the training of additional public health nurses in the Genesee County Health Department. We do 
believe, however, that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead 
testing, assure proper follow-up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels, and to continue 
water testing. We will continue to assess state and local efforts and make recommendations regarding 
specific steps that we believe are warranted. 

One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the 
absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates 
responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to 
facilitate this larger framework, which should address the following: 

1. The need for MDFIHS and MDEQ— and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in 
collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 

2. The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 

3. The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for 
contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met. 

4. The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups 
regarding action steps and updates. 

We also believe it important that a single person or entity— potentially independent of any one 
particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you, Governor— be established to 
provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures. 
For this, we also believe a readily understood "dashboard" should be developed that reports on the 
goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health 
providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program, as 



well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the 
development of that dashboard. 

We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in 
communication on this issue, as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested 
dashboard reporting. Accordingly, in advance of our final report, we would like to ensure the 
independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding 
community trust in state actions. 

We appreciate your personal interest in this issue, commitment to assisting the Task Force in our 
review, and— most importantly— commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are 
brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state. 

Respectfully yours, 


Flint Water Advisory Task Force: 

Dr. Matt Davis 

Chris Kolb 

Dr. Larry Reynolds

Flint as they relate to reducing lead exposure. I am pleased to see the progress since 
October, and recognize there is more work that must be done to ensure that this 
progress continues, 

At tha state level, there has been a confluence of efforts between Departments of 
Environmental Quality and the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate 
with the Genesee Qouniy Health Department, iocal schools, and our partners in the 
nchrproit txtmmurtfty: 

These partners are making progress, and we know we must always strive to improve 
practices and communication for Continual improvement 

You make a solid recommendation to establish a person whois independent of any one 
of the involved state agencies to serve as the point person to coordinate the ongoing 
work. J am recommending that Harvey Hollins, director of the Office of Urban Initiatives, 
carry out this effort. Harvey is well-versed in the issues and the challenges faced by our 
cities and will be effective in this role. Senior members of our executive foam will 
continue to; engage with your task force and provide direction and support to Harvey to 
ensure you will hive continued support and cooperation, We also have retained Chris 
DeWitt, a veteran communications specialist, tostrengf hen comrourilfy outreach efforts 
to make sure; residents have access to the information they need, 

1 also support your auggesf on of a daslpoprii to make information about our work and 
progress more accessible to the Flint community. These are critical measuresthat can 
be used as we look the challenges and progress in Flint, but also; can fee a part of efforts 
moving: fb ward in other areas of our state. it’s important that people have confidence 
that we are working to address any problems and will take the necessary actions to 
improve interaction among city, state and federal agencies. We also will continue to 
work with the medical community to consider how we can work together on wraparound 
needs of childrini who might experience health problems.

Congratulations on being appointed to head up the task force to resolve the Flint water 
problem. It’s a huge undertaking but we know you are up to resolving the problem. As 
we stated in our meeting we can help you with your funding needs and would like to 
discuss that with you once you get into the problem and are ready to attack that side of 
it. We can also help you with analyzing the resolve if you need to go the private 
sector. Good luck on the endeavor and should you want to discuss it further please let

Outline of Role and Responsibility— Harvey Hollins 

Flint After Action Task Force and Local/County/State Coordination 

Key Activities Draft 


I. Confirm key stakeholders that should convene on a regular basis to do the following: 

a. Identify resources and support required to manage continued testing, cognitive 
assessment, updates on progress, impediments, community outreach, etc. 

b. Assess delivery of resources protocols and adjust (door to door, neighborhood centers, 
etc.) 

c. Agree a communications strategy within the stakeholder community and aggressively 
inform the residents of Flint of resources available and consequences of inaction. 

II. Create a short/medium and long term plan to capture roles and responsibilities at the local, 
county, state (and federal if appropriate) levels which will be reviewed and approved by the key 
stakeholder body. 

III. Be responsive to mayor, media, residents and all stakeholders about what currently is being 
done and how the way forward is being envisioned and agreed by stakeholder leadership. 

IV. Work to eliminate duplication of effort and ensure that members of the science community 
engaged in assessing and protecting the public health have unfettered access to data, reports, 
etc. and establish a mutually agreeable process to surface and resolve conflicting interpretations 
of data when it occurs. 

V. Coordinate with State departments (DHHS, DEQ, Executive Office) to secure funding needed and 
subject matter resources to ensure long term monitoring and remediation efforts. 

VI. Ensure that the recommendations of the After Action Task Force are executed. 

VII. Provide weekly status updates to Governor Snyder and members of his team charged with 
supporting the Chief Coordinator. 

VIII. Determine how what is being done in Flint is relevant to other communities and needs to be 
shared as part of a state wide strategy. This may also impact future policy development to 
address long term infrastructure remediation.

Re: DRAFT DOCUMENTS: For Mayor Weaver 

Rich, 



Thanks for sharing this document with us. I agree with both of Ken's points and will add my two-cents as well. 

One point you might want to consider, is that you have identified goals of the FWIACC that appear to be more 
near-term goals or action items. You may want to include an actual stated goal or goals that are more long-term 
or when achieved will determine when the work of the FWIACC is complete. 

"Ensure safe drinking water for the residents of Flint, access to health and wrap-around services for all impacted 
children; ensure safe and reliable drinking water when the implementation of the switch to the KWA water 
source occurs; and, address long-term infrastructure needs, including replacement of lead service lines, for both 
the treatment and distribution of safe drinking water in Flint." 

I think the Mayor will be interested in how this process will produce results; bring needed resources; correct the 
water situation in Flint; provided the necessary access to health services, et al., to mitigate the impact on 
children; and, move the City to self-governance. 

It will be very important to listen to what the Mayor has to say and help to address her needs to provide 
resources and services to her community, and be more than willing to modify the plan based upon her input. 

Thanks! 

Chris

This looks very good to me at first reading... a couple of thoughts: 

(1) Key is convincing Mayor Weaver that this approach should be supported & embraced regardless of the fate 
of any federal declaration— I. e., this is the "bird in the hand" that is focused on the real on-going health 
needs, versus the federal "bird in the bush" that is not properly focused on long-term needs. 

(2) EO is critical to the success of this... it establishes structure that is inclusive at the same time it can insure 
accountability— benchmarks & metrics need to be included. The EO can create a structure that has the 
potential to be more relevant, effective, and long-term than federal "declaration." 

I like it.

Thank you both. This is helpful. While nearing final form, this is still a draft and subject to the Mayor's input and 
endorsement which I hope was dear. Agree on all points except the long term infrastructure issues will he a bit out of 
scope for this group. That is going to be more of a iegislative/executive policy and funding effort that will need a lot of

CITY OF FLINT 

INCIDENT ACTION PLAN 

STATE OF EMERGENCY 


Objectives: 


To provide short term relief and long term solutions in addressing the man-made emergency of 
increased lead levels in the City of Flint (the "City") water system resulting from the switch to Flint River 
as the City's water source as well as the threat to public health related to elevated blood lead levels in 
Flint residents, without interruption of the provision of public safety and other essential public services. 
Due to the fluidic nature of emergencies and the complexity of the City of Flint's declared emergency, 
this plan serves as a framework and may be altered as the emergency develops. 

The Response Framework 

The purpose of this plan is to organize efforts on behalf of the city to assess the extent of the City's 
infrastructure needs and risks to public health, provide immediate relief to those who are at risk, and 
establish long term solutions. In addition, the city must ascertain what immediate relief and long term 
solutions the City is capable of implementing based on what resources are available. For any activities 
that are beyond the resource capacity of the City, external sources of funding, supplies, and manpower 
must be sought. 

There are a number of steps that must be taken in accordance with the Flint Emergency Support 
Operations Plan (SEOP), in order for the City to be compliant with the Genesee County Emergency 
Action Guidelines. These include the activation of the Incident Management Team, the Emergency 
Operation Center, and the sharing of essential documents with the County, including this plan. 
Information must also be shared by the City's Public Information Officer on a regular basis, as required 
by the SEOP. 

This plan calls for the provision of immediate relief to those at risk in our community. Special 
consideration must be given to residents who belong to underserved groups, such as those who are 
homebound, undocumented, in poverty, etc. Additional consideration must also be given to the 
equitable provision of services throughout our community in order to equally protect the health and 
safety of every member of our community. 

Implementation of this plan is to be conducted by the Incident Management Team, which will monitor 
the effective delivery of goods and services in order to address the conditions of the emergency. 

Understanding the Issue: 

October 1, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a Public Health Emergency after 
elevated blood-lead levels were found among children in the City of Flint. This incident correlates with 
elevated levels of lead found in the City's drinking water after the City switched water sources in April of 


2014 to the Flint River. The scope of this problem appears to be limited to Flint City Water Customers 
and their dependents. Public agencies from several levels of government, as well as charitable, nonprofit 
organizations have partnered with the City to provide immediate relief to Flint residents, including the 
expansion of health services, the provision of bottled water and NSF rated water filters. The city is also 
seeking long term infrastructure improvements to eliminate lead and other contaminants from the 
water system. 

Gov. Rick Snyder appointed a task force to review "actions regarding water use and testing in Flint" and 
to make recommendations for future guidelines: Members of the state task force are Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants, Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council, Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children's Health Center. 

In an effort to halt the further escalation of this crisis, the City returned to receiving its water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) on October 16, 2015. Since that time, additional 
corrosion control program has started, estimating a reduction of lead levels over the next six months. In 
light of these efforts, concerns surrounding the quality of water and health of the residents persist to 
the point that Mayor Karen Weaver declared a State of Emergency on December 14, 2015 so as to 
resolve this crisis once and for all. 

The current challenge facing the City is providing immediate relief and long term solutions of the quality 
of the water and health of residents while the City remains in a financially critical condition. It is hoped 
and expected that higher levels of government recognize this emergency as it pertains to the condition 
of the City's infrastructure and health of its residents, and do all things necessary to assist the City in the 
provision of relief and the execution of capital improvement projects that will eliminate the causes of 
this emergency. 

Enhancing Understanding: 

Information Collection 

Essential Elements of Information (EEls) can be qualified as the City's water tests containing lead results, 
the verification of lead water lines (both public and private), and health information. Water testing is 
performed by the City's water plant in cooperation with the MDEQ.. The verification of lead water lines is 
being handled by University of Michigan Flint, who is currently digitizing the City's water line 
information and PSI Engineering, who is initiating the effort to verify lead lines by excavating an initial 
150 residential lines. This information allows the Incident Management Team to assess the current 
condition of the emergency by way of determining the water quality and the condition of the water 
distribution infrastructure. 


Information Analysis 

The City has sought partners to assist in the analysis and attenuation of complex data. Wayne State 
University's center for Urban Studies has agreed to assist the City in its efforts to document and track 
lead water lines, water test results, and filter distribution with geographic information system (GIS) 
technology. This allows for easily updateable, digestible information to be presented to officials. 

Assessment of Impacts 

The City will need assistance in determining the total cost of damage done to the public health and 
infrastructure. As of now, only portions of this damage are visible. 

PSI is providing some assistance by excavating 150 residential water lines to verify that they are 
comprised of lead. This is an initial step, but not enough. More resources will be needed to continue this 
process. 

Continuous Situational Awareness 

It is important that the Emergency Management Team receive continuous information regarding water 
testing results, lead water line numbers, and filter distribution information in order to gain a realistic 
and current perspective. Much of his information is currently available on the City's website 
(cityofflint.com) and more is added each week by the PIO team. 

Actions taken in Response to the Emergency 

Activation of the Incident Management Team 

Upon the declaration of Emergency by Mayor Weaver, the Support Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP) 
was activated. The SEOP calls upon the Incident Management Team to generate the Incident Action Plan 
(IAP. Each member of this team serves a specific function as it relates to addressing the causes and 
effects of the emergency. The Emergency Management Team roster can be found in the SEOP on page 
3, with a list of alternates on page 4 in case the need for succession arises. 

Emergency Operations Center 

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) must be activated upon the declaration of a State of 
Emergency by the Mayor. This center is required by the SEOP and serves as a nerve center for the 
Incident Management Team. Here, emergency relief efforts are coordinated by key members of the 
Incident Management Team. In this case, these relief efforts consist of the distribution of water filters at 



City Hall and community events, the distribution of bottled water throughout the city in conjunction 
with the efforts of community partners, and assisting with the circulation of water testing kits 
throughout the community. The EOC will also be monitoring and managing the inventory of relief 
supplies, such as water filters and bottled water. 

According to the SEOP, the EOC must establish an incident tracking system. This system will serve as a 
work plan for the management of the emergency. In addition, it is essential that the IMT record water 
testing results, lead water line location information, and information about the distribution of water 
filters and bottled water all in one place so that information is readily available for the Incident 
Management Team. This information will also be sent out to the public and media in the form of daily 
regular updates by the City's PIO. 

Communication 

The EOC maintains a telephone system that exists to intake questions about relief efforts and to 
organize relief logistics. It is open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. A voicemail system and 
eventual email system will exist to handle requests and inquiries that occur outside of the normal 
operating hours. This system will be constructed by the City's IS department. 

Public Awareness and Education 

1. Emergency Alerts and Updates: 

The City's Public Information Officer will make available information as it relates to the 
emergency in the form of press releases, emails, and physical documents. Daily updates 
containing information on the distribution of water filters, bottled water, water testing, blood 
lead testing, and other relief efforts will be available on the City's website for the public to view. 
Information will be available at City Hall for residents. 

2. Joint Information Center: 

The City's PIO will establish a joint Information Center that is organized to coordinate the efforts 
of multiple agencies to communicate with the public. This includes the circulation of joint press 
releases, public health information, educational materials, and updates relating to the State of 
Emergency. This committee is comprised of public information officers and public relations 
personnel to coordinate efforts to keep the public updated and informed. Regular updates to 
the media regarding events and progress will be made as news develops. 

The US EPA has offered assistance in the form of Public Information support. Additional support 
in this area has been provided by the Michigan State Police. 


3. Education: 

Many government agencies and philanthropic organizations are already distributing information 
regarding the effects of lead on public health. It is important that the City assist in these efforts 
so vital information and knowledge is presented to all members of the community. The goal is to 
continue to eliminate misunderstandings and incorrect information as it relates to reducing lead 
in drinking water, pursuing medical help, and maintaining a healthy diet to reduce lead 
absorption in the body. Lead education is currently being performed by the Genesee County 
Health Department, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Medical 
community at-large. 


Assessment of Social Needs 

In order to effectively and equitably provide immediate relief to Flint water customers, the City must 
take into account many of the socio-economic needs and limitations of the community. Some residents 
cannot get to City Hall for a water filter. Some residents do not have internet access. Literacy or a 
language barrier may also pose significant obstacles to the effective distribution of educational 
information and relief to those in need. These will be continuing challenges facing the community. At 
present these are the resources the City has available to mitigate some of those challenges. 

Logistics 


Logistics are being coordinated by the City Emergency Management Team's City's Chief Logistics Officer, 
who is the City Administrator. The CLO is responsible for the coordination, procurement, and 
transportation of goods and services, which is essential for effective implementation of the response 
plan. 

Fixed Distribution Points 

There are several locations throughout the city where residents may acquire a water filter. These 
locations are: 


Flint City Hall 

1101 South Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 

Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) 

601 North Saginaw, Flint Ml 48502 
and 

2727 Lippencott Blvd, Flint Ml 48507 



Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 

4809 Clio Road, Flint Ml 48504 
and 

125 E. Union Street, Flint, Ml 48502 

Activation of Ward Distribution Centers 

Each of the nine wards will have activated distribution centers that are primarily managed by City 
Council Members or their designees.

Mobile Distribution Centers 

With the help of transportation agencies, like the Metro Transit Authority (MTA), meals on wheels, and 
GCCARD, the city can help establish mobile distribution centers and delivery systems that can provide 
water filters, bottled water, and nutritious foods, among other types of relief accompanied by 
educational materials to neighborhoods and to homes of people who experience limited mobility. 

• Mass Transportation Authority-MTA bus passes: Assisting residents with bus passes to 
improve their mobility will increase their chances of receiving help. Transportation 
services will also improve residents' access to medical care. 

• MTA-Your Ride mobile distribution: 

0 Estimated Costs: $25 per hour to deliver water and filters to homes throughout 
the City. 

Problem 1. Public Health Emergency 

The first objective in addressing this emergency is reducing, and eventually eliminating, the danger to 
public health. As City water coming out of faucets continue to contain lead, and copper and other 


7 


































harmful contaminants exceeding government guidelines and regulations, it poses a risk to the people of 
our community. Preventative measures must be taken to avoid the effects of toxicosis that are difficult if 
not impossible to completely reverse. 

As far as preventative measures are concerned, education, water filters, and bottled water must be 
provided to every household in the City in order to reduce the chances of lead exposure, especially to 
our most vulnerable members of the community. If lead exposure has occurred, resulting in elevated 
blood lead levels, immediate and sustained medical attention must be available to those affected. 

Health services must be expanded in the area to accommodate increased numbers of case loads and 
specialized care regarding lead poisoning and its effects. 

Immediate Relief for Public Health: 

1. Prevention: Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing, and bottled 
water must be available to everyone. 

2. Access to nutritious food that reduces the risks of lead absorption by the body. The City can 
coordinate activities with the County Health Department 

Long Term Solutions: Maintaining Public Health and Coping with Lead Exposure 

1. Work closely with the Genesee County Health Department and Michigan Department of Health 
and Human Services in order to provide sustainable care and monitoring of children exposed to 
lead. This care must be available for them for several years-preferably several decades. 

2. Support and education for primary care providers regarding aggressive long-term 
neurodevelopmental screening and testing. 

3. Improved access to developmental and behavioral (DBP) specialists, pediatric psychologists, 
pediatric psychiatrists. 

a. Pre-emptive referral to mental health/ toxic stress screenings. 

b. Support capacity building and or incentivize recruitment to allow Genesee health system 
(CMH) to build this capacity which is currently needed and lacking. 

4. Increase recognition and education regarding trauma informed care, social determinants of 
health (SDOH). 

5. Expand State funded Genesee Health System (CMH) services. 

a. Infant mental health (30 day capacity) 

b. Child case management 

c. Home based services 

d. Trauma informed care- trauma focused CBT 

Problem 2. Lead Contamination in the Water 
Immediate Relief: 


1. Education, water filters and replacement cartridges, free water testing for water customers, and 
bottled water must be available to everyone. Water filters can be obtained at any of the fixed 
distribution points throughout the City. 

2. Identification and verification of lead water service lines throughout the city- both public and 
private. 

3. Assistance to identify lead pipes within buildings and homes. 

Distribution of Bottled Water: 

At this point, we are directing all offers for donations to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan. It is 
imperative that water be accessible to all members of the community through a variety of distribution 
channels. These channels are explained in the Logistics Section of this plan. 

Distribution of Test Bottles: 

Water testing kits can be picked up at City Hall with instructions. Test results are posted on the City's 
website to raise public awareness and encourage more participation. 

Long term Solutions: Capital Improvements Needs 

The distribution of filters, water, and food to counter the effects of lead are essential response efforts to 
keep people safe. However, long term solutions are required to keep people healthy, to eliminate lead 
from the public and private water distribution system distribution, and to provide affordable clean 
water. Our public infrastructure and utilities must be reliable, sustainable, and equitable in order for this 
community to rebound after this emergency. The following long term solutions must be implemented in 
order to set the City of Flint on a course for recovery. These solutions come at a heavy cost for a City 
that is currently in receivership. The City has experienced financial distress due to this Emergency, in 
addition to a two million dollar loss from switching back to DWSD. The City has diligently applied for 
Fiscally Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships, Grant in order to supplement funding for capital 
improvement projects. It is essential that these grants be awarded in order to achieve long term 
solutions. 

1. COUPLETS Transition to a Temporary Safe Water Source until the Completion of KWA: 

This has already occurred. On October 16, 2015, Flint returned to receiving its water from DWSD 
on a 9 month agreement. This agreement will expire in June 2016, when the KWA is projected to 
be complete. The City had to pay $2 million out of its general fund to make this switch. 

2, UN PROGRESS Additional Corrosion Control added to the Water System: 


This is already occurring. In early December, 2015, Flint began to add additional corrosion 
control to the water coming in from DWSD in attempts to rebuild the protective scale inside its 
pipes. This is estimated to reduce lead levels in two to six months. 

3. Faucet Replacement: 

Replacement of Water faucets, and drinking fountains in the school system. It has been 
determined after state inspections that many sources of lead contamination in the School 
System's water were the faucets themselves. These faucets need to be replaced. 

4. Water Line Replacement: 

Water Line Replacement to reduce antiquated infrastructure and lead service lines. These lines 
must be identified, verified, and replaced. Residents who are facing financial hardships must 
have access to assistance to cover the costs of these replacements through access to grants and 
(forgivable) loans made available through State and Federal agencies. The corrosion damage to 
public and private lines that Flint River water caused is still being determined. 

• Replacement of an estimated fifteen thousand (15,000) lead service lines at an 

estimated cost of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per line. Total costs forty -five million 
dollars ($45,000,000). This project is estimated to be one of the most cost-intensive 
endeavors related to ameliorating water contaminants. 

5. Reimbursement of Critical Expenditures: 

Seeking reimbursement of two million dollar cost of returning to DWSD and forgiveness of 
Water Revolving Loan Debt from the State of Michigan. 


6. KWA Capital Improvements: The City has reconnected to Detroit temporarily until a water line 
from Port Huron is developed. The new water line known as the KWA pipeline or Karegnondi 
Water Authority is expected to bring water to the City from Lake Huron by July. The current cost 
agreement between Flint and DWSD is for nine months, therefore it is imperative that KWA be 
completed as soon as possible. Assistance relating to capital improvements to expedite this 
process will help to achieve long term goals. 


KWA Capital Improvements: 

a. Transfer Station to Dort Reservoir 

b. Raw water line to pump station #4 

c. Phosphoric acid feed system 

d. Alum Feed system 

e. Post filtration system 


Estimated Costs:

Ancillary Considerations: Public Safety during an Emergency 

During a time of emergency public safety agencies need to be prepared to respond to threats to public 
safety and critical infrastructure. The City is facing a man-made emergency that is threatening the public 
health. Resentment and hostility toward local institutions and municipal government is at a significant 
level. 

Critical infrastructure should be safeguarded if the need arises. This includes increasing security at City 
Hall to reduce potential for public safety risks. In the case of credible threats to public infrastructure, it 
may be required to hire private security company for first line of defense. Private Security is lower cost, 
thereby making it the first option. The minimum response is acted upon first, elevating only if the need 
arises. Credible or imminent threats of damage or destruction to critical infrastructure requires an 
elevated response. Such needs may require over-time police officers to address critical situations. 
Mutual aid from surrounding communities can be requested if Flint public safety is overextended. 

Implementation: 

Community Partners 

Financial limitations of the city persist while it confronts this emergency. Many community partners 
have offered their assistance to perform various needed functions. The city is heavily reliant on the 
assistance that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have provided. 

The Mott Foundation 

The Mott Foundation has provided financial assistance, especially in their generous contribution of $4 
million. In addition, the Mott Foundation has recently pledged an additional 

United Way 

The Genesee County United Way has provided significant financial assistance in the way of purchasing 
and helping to distribute water filters since the public health emergency began on October 1 st , 2015. 

Genesee County Community Action Resources Department (GCCARD) 


11 


GCCARD is organized to fight poverty and has been a primary partner in the distribution of water filters. 
It has also regularly supported the city with the logistics and availability of water filters at City Hall. 

Genesee County Health Department 

Has provided educational information to Flint Water customers 

Genesee County Board of Commissioners 

The Board of Commissioners have pledged their support to help Flint seek solutions to this crisis. The 
Board has already assisted in making health and nutrition information available to the public. 

Assistance from Wayne State University 

Wayne State University's Center for Urban Studies will be providing technical GIS support to assist in the 
documentation of emergency relief efforts. 

The US Environmental Protection Agency 

Region 5 EPA has offered assistance with Public Information distribution during the emergency. 

Outside Help is still needed... 

The City of Flint is forever thankful to our community partners who have given so much to help so many 
people. However the magnitude of this emergency calls for more resources that are beyond the capacity 
of the combined local organizations and government agencies. Long term solutions will require a heavy 
investment in health care and capital improvement projects to upgrade the city's antiquated water 
distribution system. 

• Help with Immediate Relief in terms of assuring allocative efficiency. Distribution should 
be equitable- assistance from other governments required to assure this. 

• Reaching communities for the distribution of water filters, water, and educational 
materials. 

• Help with Water Testing to increase participation and lead education. 

• Increasing the rate of water testing 

• Assistance is required to fund essential capital improvement projects to guarantee clean 
and safe water.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden; 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich,, have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 
For this reason, 1 am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 


conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 


of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink. 


Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention. 


Sincerely,

Per Our Conversation 

DRAFT Coord Com Org Chart 233264. pptx; FWIACC document v2.docx 


Mayor Weaver: 

Per our conversation, Governor Snyder and several members of his team are committed to acting now, 
with the State, City and County in partnership, and not wait on any federal action or determination on an 
emergency declaration. If a federal emergency declaration is issued, this will be part of the combined 
response effort and will help marshal more resources towards resolving the issues facing Flint. Right 
now though, the Governor wishes to immediately implement an action plan with State and Local entities 
and bring together agencies and stakeholders. 

Our working draft title is the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee (FWIACC), and it would 
immediately address ways to restore safe water and monitor/mitigate the effects of the lead. 

In addition to Governor Snyder, the key officials working on this blueprint were MSP Capt. Chris 
Kelenske, DHHS Chief Deputy Tim Becker, DHHS Director Nick Lyon, the Governor’s Transformation 
Advisor Rich Baird and myself. The need for engaged central coordination has also been recommended 
by the Governor’s Flint Water After-Action Task Force, of which Dr. Larry Reynolds is a member. 
Governor Snyder has endorsed this approach and has asked me to provide you with a draft copy in 
advance of your meeting with him on January 7. If you agree, we will organize this committee 
immediately, and the Governor will issue an executive order authorizing FWIACC to work on the issue for 
the long term . 

As you know, there is a significant amount of work to be done before the Federal government will 
approve an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act. FWIACC could begin its work immediately and 
would be in place to complement, not replace any action group ultimately formed by an emergency 
declaration. And we believe it would demonstrate how to best leverage essential support addressing 
manmade emergencies like this, since existing laws are more oriented toward natural disasters. 

We brainstormed who should be included in this initial emergency response, with the idea that you and 
other stakeholders may have recommendations on others who need to be added. 

Attached are two draft documents that defines the FWIACC. You will note the organization chart and the 
proposal description is not a normal hierarchical entity. This is a collaborative, stakeholder-driven 
partnership. Chris and I would facilitate it, but it is a partnership of city, county and state viewpoints, and 
would include outside experts like Marc Edwards and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. 

All parties will be required to be transparent about their ideas and findings, agreeing to accountability 
measures and reporting on them on a regular basis. 

Please let me know your thoughts on this approach and also other agenda items you wish to see on 
January 7. If you agree, we would also invite the interim DEQ director, Keith Creagh, and the newly 
appointed spokesperson to meet you then. 

Best,

DRAFT: A Proposal to Create the Flint Water Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Committee (FWIACC) 


Statement of Need 

To better coordinate resources and personnel and react with urgency, Harvey Hollins and MSP Capt. 
Chris Kelenske have been tasked with creating FWIACC, subject to the approval and endorsement by 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. 

We are also recommending, by executive order, that Gov. Rick Snyder authorizes this committee to help 
restore safe water in Flint and coordinate efforts addressing health/behavioral consequences from lead 
ingestion. 

This inter-agency group will fully engage with all stakeholders committed to solving Flint water issues. 
Equal partners. Equal leadership. Equal responsibility. Equal chance to be part of the solution to an 
important and not fully understood problem. 

FWIACC will be facilitated by Hollins and Kelenske, who represent statewide resources and 
constituencies, with support from senior members of the Governor's office. 

An overview of FWIACC's goals: 

• Create a routine information process between all parties. 

• Pursue other avenues of funding, including federal grants and legislative appropriations. 

• Implement without delay any appropriate mechanisms that are called for in the Emergency 
Management Act or the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. These may include 
local emergency operations plans and guides. 

Action Plan 

Immediately, FWIACC will: 

1 . Establish an interagency workgroup described in the attached organizational chart. It will be 
comprised of DHHS, MDEQ, MSP, Treasury, Genesee County, City of Flint, MDE, LARA and external 
subject matter experts (SMEs). Other entities may be added as needed. Personnel must be goal- 
oriented, transparent with findings, and able to accomplish FWIACC Incident Action Plan items 
created by the state in a timely manner. The FWIACC plan would be created with city, county, state 
and federal needs in mind. 

2. Assemble staff with competencies in disaster/emergency planning, operations and finance as 
outlined under the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Staff will be accountable to the 
FWIACC leadership to track resource requests and document progress on the FWIACC incident 
action plan. 

3. Utilize the National Incident Management System and Unified/Incident Command as appropriate. 

4. Establish routine communications protocols at the operational, executive and legislative levels as 
determined appropriate. 

5. Establish interagency workgroup objectives using the following as a starting point. 



Interagency Workgroup Objectives 


1 . Determine and convey acceptable standards for potable water. 

■ Identify needed remediation. 

■ Convey the remediation plan objectives to all stakeholders and interested parties. 

■ Create logistics for distributing water and filters, particularly to homebound citizens. 

■ Implement the plan. 

2. Determine health impacts for the impacted population. 

■ Identify treatment methods, nutrition education and protocols for monitoring, 
neurodevelopmental screening, access to DBP specialists and 
psychologists/psychiatrists, expanded county services, etc. 

■ Convey the treatment plan objectives to interested parties. 

■ Implement the plan. 

3. Establish a public information protocol to effectively inform the community. 

■ Identify existing public information outlets within the city, county and state, 
including schools, churches and other formal and informal distribution networks. 

■ Establish a Joint Information Center. 

■ Provide for emergency alerts and updates. 

■ Determine the process for approving official information before it's disseminated. 

■ Convey to interested parties. 

4. Assess the status of the infrastructure and determine feasible actions to upgrade the water 
system. 

■ Determine current state of the infrastructure. 

■ Develop priorities, costs and potential funding sources for infrastructure upgrades 
as part of a long term recovery plan. 

■ Seek partners to assist (NGOs, Foundations, Business, etc.). 

■ Implement the plan.

RE: Per our conversation 

Mayor, 



I believe you are referring to the paragraph in the draft proposal that reads as follows: "To better coordinate resources 
and personnel and react with urgency, Harvey Hollins and MSP Capt. Chris Kelenske have been tasked with creating 
FWIACC, subject to the approval and endorsement by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver." 

That paragraph simply asks if you believe that the creation of the FWIACC would be beneficial to the city. Actions 
addressing the water problems in Flint, through the FWIACC will be taken by various experts/professionals as outlined in 
the organizational chart. 

Transparency is also a critical objective of the Governor, in saying that, we will need your advice on how to optimize that 
objective for the residents in the city. 

Regarding a definite time for your response, why don't you take the next couple of days to really give the proposal a 
more thorough look over, and save your response for your meeting with the Governor. 

If you have any other questions or concerns in the interim, please send them my was as this is still a work in progress. 

Best, 

Harvey

I received your correspondence, and in reviewing it, my concern is that we only have me, yourself, MSP Capt. Chris 
Kelenske In deciding this important decision about the water problems here in the city of Flint. I would like to have more 
professional input, such as the Task Force that has been put in place. 

In looking at the written plan of action, it seems to be a positive step in the right direction. I also want to make sure the 
transparency of whatever we do is included. 

How soon do you need a definite answer to the proposed plan?

This looks very good to me at first reading... a couple of thoughts: 

(1) Key is convincing Mayor Weaver that this approach should be supported & embraced regardless of the fate 
of any federal declaration— I. e., this is the "bird in the hand" that is focused on the real on-going health 
needs, versus the federal "bird in the bush" that is not properly focused on long-term needs. 

(2) EO is critical to the success of this.... it establishes structure that is inclusive at the same time it can insure 
accountability— benchmarks & metrics need to be included. The EO can create a structure that has the 
potential to be more relevant, effective, and long-term than federal "declaration." 

I like it.

The health and welfare of Flint residents is a top priority, and we're 
committed to working closely with Mayor Weaver and the Genesee 
County Commission on a coordinated response to health and 
infrastructure issues. 

After the County Commission's vote today, the Michigan State Police's 
Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division is working 
with the Genesee County Emergency Management Coordinator to 
gather information about the resources needed for a Governor's 
declaration. 

The state police has been closely engaged in the situation since the 
beginning, meeting with both county and city leaders to guide them

through state and federal laws regarding the emergency management 
process. Due to the uniqueness of this situation, we have to look at all 
possible options to help Flint residents. 

But prior to a formal declaration, we are recognizing this as an 
emergency and are working with city and county leaders to coordinate 
efforts, streamline communication and tap all available resources at the 
state's control.

Water Filter 

Mark, 



Per our last conversation, I expressed that we were interested acquiring and distributing 1500 water filters to 
Flint residents to assist with the quality (perceived or real) of their drinking water until the KWA pipeline 
comes online. 

A few weeks ago, you asked me to send you the product ID number so you could check with your suppliers 
regarding price. I apologize for taking long to send you product ID; a number of conversations needed to occur 
in Flint before we could proceed. 

The product ID for a Brita Filter for kitchen faucets is: 

Product ID 3 176421 
UPC 7-23987-0078 

Thank you for taking the time to look into this.

are Well Below the Required Action Level, City No Longer in Violation 

For Immediate Release 


MDEQ Testing of City of Flint Water Shows TTHM Levels are Well Below 
the Required Action Level, City No Longer in Violation 


Flint, Michigan - September 3, 2015 - The City of Flint has made significant improvements to its 
water treatment process and distribution system. Annual average results show all locations are 
within acceptable limits for total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and work continues to ensure that the 
average stays below the acceptable level. Flint’s TTHM levels have now been below the 
actionable level for four consecutive quarters, long enough to bring the City out of violation with 
the Safe Water Drinking Act. 


l 



Installation of the Granulated Activated Carbon filter mediums in July has had a significant 
impact on the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) and is expected to continue to do so. TOC 
contact with chlorine can lead to the creation of the chemical byproduct trihalomethanes. By 
reducing the amount of TOC in the treated water, the amount of TTHM in the water fell as a 
direct result. 

“The City of Flint is continuing to improve its water system including both the areas of treatment 
and distribution,” said Mayor Dayne Walling. “As the issue of trihalomethanes comes under 
control and the City is no longer in violation of safety standards, it will work with the MDEQ on 
implementing water optimization measures to reduce the corrosive effects of water on older 
pipes and home service lines.” Older pipes and service lines can contain lead solder which can 
leach into the water over time. 

Flint has been looking at the water optimization option for some time and is now looking at 
taking accelerated steps toward implementation. According to the MDEQ, a typical water 
optimization plan can take up to five years to complete, as in the case of the Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department. The City of Flint plans to have its water optimization measures in place 
by the beginning of 2016. This measure, combined with the ongoing improvements to the 
distribution system wherever possible, will improve water quality and extend the performance of 
the City’s aging infrastructure. 

“The City of Flint has been in constant communication with the MDEQ in our continuing efforts 
to upgrade and improve our water system,” said Director of Public Works Howard Croft. “We 
have received assurances from them that every step we have taken has been in line with their 
recommended actions. The City will continue to work to ensure safe, quality water to its 
residents, businesses and visitors.” 

The City of Flint will continue to provide updates on its water progress through its website, 
cityoft11nt.com. Anyone with water issues is encouraged to call 810-766-7202 so that they can be 
addressed. Residents wishing to receive a free and independent in-home water test can call 810- 
787-6537 or email flintwater @c it yo fHint.com.

Hi Ron, 

Thank you for the time to reach out to a couple people in the state offices. 

The state has worked with Flint for a number of years to help the city address its dire financial struggles. 
And while there are still some challenges ahead, Mayor Walling and the City Council assumed control at 
the end of April, and we continue to work with them. 

Flint, like other Michigan cities, has challenges with its infrastructure. Gov. Snyder, with our partners in 
the Legislature, continues to work toward a long-term, sustainable solution to the state's infrastructure 
needs. 

The state has been working closely with Flint leaders for months on some specific challenges, including 
restructuring of loans to postpone payments of about $2.2 million - freeing up money to help the city 
address some longstanding problems - and $2 million in grants for improvement projects. We continue 
to work with the city's leaders on their struggles.

httj3://www.mHvexom/new$/fiint/index.ssf/2013/'03/fiint city council approves re.html 
Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, 
pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the City. Another 2 million 
gallons per day would come from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. DEQ told the city it 
needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at 
Flint’s water plant. Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and 
Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times per year.

offer to continue buying water from Detroit and two days after Detroit gave Flint a 
notice of termination of its 1965 water contract.

The Flint River was not a viable option to provide drinking water to city residents when 
the water relationship between Flint and Detroit was stable. But river water migh t be 
used temporarily as the city’s water supply now that Flint signed an agreement with the 
Karegnondi Water Authority and will get up to 18 million gallons per day of raw water in 
2016 from Lake Huron. The Flint River hadn’t been an option, city officials previously 
said, because upgrades to Flint's water plant would be too expensive, the river didn’t 
provide enough capaci ty to serve Flint residents’ water needs and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality would not. allow it.

Thanks for the FYI Nick. Santana is looking for about 400 filters to get to Hispanic families from a distribution spot taking 
address information only for tracking purposes without having to disclose names. The solution for that population, who 
might be concerned about ICE, is to have them obtain the filters from alternative donors other than the state. I will 
follow up with Santana.

October 8, 2015 

Congressman Dan Kildee (MI-05) issued the following statement today after Governor 
Snyder announced that the city of Flint would reconnect to the Detroit water system: 

“Reconnecting to the Detroit water system is the right next step to provide Flint residents 
with safe drinking water. But how Flint pays for safe water until the Karegnondi Water 
Authority is operational is a separate question. 

“Flint is a financially distressed city, and it should not have to empty out its bank account to 
pay for the state’s failures. The decision to switch to the Flint River water source was made 
while the city was under state emergency management, and now it is incumbent on 
Governor Snyder and the state to fix - and pay - for the problem they created. 

“Flint paying anything for the problem that the state created in the first place means that 
other improvements, including to the city’s aging water infrastructure system, could be 
delayed. This is especially troublesome considering that the state of Michigan has 
consistently cut tens of millions of dollars of revenue sharing to the city of Flint in recent 
years. 

“Flint residents are also Michigan residents, who pay state taxes and, like every other city in 
our state, expect clean and safe drinking water. The state of Michigan created this problem, 
and they need to pay for the solution to fix it.”

Re: Good Morning Harvey! 

Myra, 



Sorry that I did not reply earlier. 

Re Flint, it is a messed up situation that we are working to resolve. Most don't understand how much control the city 
had/has with it's water operations irrespective of the state's fiscal management. Quite frankly, the city failed to 
properly treat the water from the Flint River. After we normalize the water quality, we have to understand why the city 
decided to treat the water the way it did. ..stay tuned. 

Re our candidates from Michigan, I understand from Kim that a score of 70% is the cutoff. She said that both failed the 
first midterm, but did much better on the second. Were the scores in the spreadsheet the first or second test scores? 

Thanks for sharing.

Myra, 

Sorry that I did not reply earlier. 

Re Flint, it is a messed up situation that we are working to resolve. Most don't understand how 
much control the city had/has with it's water operations irrespective of the state's fiscal 
management. Quite frankly, the city failed to properly treat the water from the Flint River. After 
we normalize the water quality, we have to understand why the city decided to treat the water the 
way it did... stay tuned. 

Re our candidates from Michigan, I understand from Kim that a score of 70% is the cutoff. She 
said that both failed the first midterm, but did much better on the second. Were the scores in the 
spreadsheet the first or second test scores? 

Thanks for sharing. 

Best, 

Harvey

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. “Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, 
environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and 


i 



Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, 
public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the 
state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the 
MEC for six years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan 
Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having 
joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public 
Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community 
Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 

Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served 
as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as 
Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the county’s 
bankruptcy and issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of 
Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, 
wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Children’s Health 
Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice 
for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Flint Water Decision Clarification Op-Ed_FINAL.pdf 

Flint Water Decision Clarification Op-Ed_FINAL.pdf; ATT00001.txt

Changes to Flint Water System Made By Local Leaders, Not Emergency Managers 
Author: Darnell Earley, ICMA-CM, MPA 

It is critically important that the record be set straight about the decision-making and approval 
processes that led to Flint joining the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) with the use of Flint 
River water as the interim water supply. The fact is, that the river has served and been used as 
the back-up supply for decades, and this was the rationale given to me by staff and Mayor 
Walling, who also serves as chairperson of the KWA board. Contrary to reports in the media and 
rhetoric being espoused by individuals, the decision was made at the local level, by local civic 
leaders. 

The decision to separate from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and go with the KWA, 
which included the decision to pump Flint River water in the interim, were both a part of a long- 
term plan that was approved by Flint's Mayor, and confirmed by a City Council vote of 7-1 on 
March 25, 2013. This plan was presented to me when I was appointed as Flint Emergency 
Manager in October 2013 - a full seven months after City Council's affirmative vote. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright also made the affirmative vote by the City 
Council a necessary condition of joining the KWA, and applauded the decision in a March 26, 
2013 news release, saying, "...I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by 
Flint's City Council and Mayor... I am glad that the residents of Flint were able to have their 
voices heard via their elected officials." 

The Mayor's approval of the plan, and the subsequent near unanimous vote by City Council 
were in no way coerced, forced or demanded by the State, nor any Emergency Manager. 
Council's affirmative vote was supported and officially signed into EM Executive Order by then 
Emergency Manager Edward Kurtz on March 29, 2013. A subsequent order Kurtz signed on 
June 26, 2013, speaks specifically to the, "... upgrading of the Flint Water Plant to ready it to 
treat water from the Flint River to serve as the primary drinking water source for approximately 
two years and then converting to KWA delivered lake water." 

When I began my term as Emergency Manager, it fell to me to oversee the implementation of 
the previously accepted and approved plans, as the DWSD terminated the contract with Flint in 
April 2014. It did not fall to me to question, second guess or to invalidate the actions that were 
taken prior to my appointment. 

At the time the decision was made there was no way to predict such an unfortunate outcome. I 
would also offer that had local leaders known then what they know now, parts of their decision 
may have been entirely different. What the City of Flint and the State of Michigan are now 
dealing with is the management of an unintended consequence resulting in a negative outcome 
from an otherwise sound public policy decision. There is no "blame" to affix on any Emergency 
Manager for that. 



As the solutions are put into place to address the serious concerns at hand, I believe that 
everyone's attention should now turn toward another serious concern -- what is being done in 
the long-term to replace the aged and crumbling water distribution systems that exists 
throughout Flint and Genesee County, which was a major contributing factor to this serious 
issue in the first place. 

I am a strong believer that the truth supported by fact, speaks for itself. This was a local 
decision that was made by local civic leaders. Anyone who says otherwise is being disingenuous 
for whatever reason. 


Sincerely, 



Darnell Earley, ICMA-CM, MPA

Andrew, I need you to call call Benton Harbor, Kalamazoo and Battle Creek's superintendents and ask if they are planning 
water testing in their schools. If so, send send an email to DEQ Director Dan Wyant and copy me, Dennis Muchmore and 
Jamod Agen. If not, don't worry about the communication. 

Bay City, Pontiac and Saginaw schools are moving forward. While DEQ is working on their protocols, a number of schools 
are moving forward with testing. I want the Governor informed about the activity. 

Remember, this is simply an inquiry to testing activity in urban districts.

Hello All, 

I spoke with Madhu Anderson, Senior Policy Director for DEQ on the 
outreach to urban schools on water testing. I wanted to understand 
what DEQ's process was before we started canvassing, in case questions 
arose. George Krisztian, DEQ Lab Director and head of the Flint 
Action Response Team, suggested if possible that we hold off until they 
have a process and protocols in place on working with schools outside 
of the 13 Flint schools. They are working as quickly as possible with 
these 13 to establish some kind of response capability and 
backgrounder for all schools. They know, as we do, that this is most 
likely a statewide issue. Harvey, do you feel comfortable holding up on 
the calls to systems?

Thank you. I know there were discussions with city officials before Kurtz signed that order. Does he have any

Harvey, 


Mr. Earley asked that I send you the attached executive order signed by former Flint EM 
Edward Kurtz, which clearly indicates that a decision on the use of Flint River water had been 
made by June of 2013. 


This was not included in the packet of documents that had previously been provided by 
Treasury. 


Any questions, please let him know.

DEQ director messaging 


Hi John- Dave asked me to send you the internal email and statement we issued last week. This makes our messaging on 
Dan's departure clear. 


Let me know if you have any questions. 


Laura 

Email: 

Team, 

As you are aware, we have been working closely with the independent taskforce that has been reviewing state, local and 
federal actions regarding the serious health issues related to water in Flint. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet complete, members have made the Governor aware of some interim 
findings, and there are interim steps the Governor has decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how we in 
state government keep residents safe and informed. 

As part of this process, Dan Wyant, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, has offered his resignation, and 
Governor has reluctantly decided to accept it. There are likely to be other personnel changes in MDEQ as well. 

I want to thank Dan for his service. He has been the DEQ director since the start of the administration, and previously 
headed the Agriculture Department under both Gov. Engler and Gov. Granholm. He is passionate about public service 
and protecting our state's environment. 

The situation in Flint is serious and challenging. We will continue to work closely with the taskforce and city leaders as 
we move forward, committed to protecting the health of people living in Flint and around our state. 

Sincerely, 

Jarrod Agen 

Press release: 


Gov. Rick Snyder Lakes action on initial findings from Hint Water Task Force 

Changes to take place at DEQ, meeting planned with Mayor Karen Weaver 

In response to initial findings from the Flint Water Task Force, Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following 
statement: 

"When I became aware that the city of Flint's water showed elevated lead levels and that the state's handling of 
the situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority and appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 


l 



"The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of Flint, 
Genesee County, state and federal officials. Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, 
members have made me aware of some interim findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take 
immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe and informed. 

"We'll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns. 

"In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I've determined that it's appropriate to 
accept it. I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force. 

"But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the 
scientific community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health 
and Human Services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping 
us improve Flint water. Let's share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at accurate 
and mutually supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we're using the very best testing 
protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe drinking water and that we're taking steps to protect their health 
over the short and long term. 

"I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan 
citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging 
infrastructure. 

"I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That's why I'm taking the actions today to 
ensure a culture of openness and trust. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water 
filters, and help in other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to meet soon to 
discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

"These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our task 
force. When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything we can to 
protect the well-being of our citizens."

GOVERNOR 


State of Michigan 
DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY

ANDY DILLON 
STATE TREASURER 


SUMMARY REPORT 


TO: Brom Stibitz, Senior Policy Advisor; Department of Treasury 

FROM: Eric Cline. Unit Operations Specialist 

SUBJECT: Flint Water System Summary 

DATE: April 18,2013 


Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc. 
(TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & Sewer 
Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The purpose of this 
study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) 
in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury’ and the City of 
Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were presented: These 
options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of untreated Lake Huron 
Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or provision of variable amounts of 
water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report by TYJT 
in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA’s principal engineering firm regarding the others' conclusions 
and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the OFR provided a comprehensive report to the State Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) 
The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the projections provided by Flint/KWA were 
acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; and 3) Identification of the options Flint will 
utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR 
recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA presented the best future option for future potable water. The 
OFR also concluded that KWA appeared to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee 
County appeared willing to assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA 
project could signify the beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and 
the KWA project had both political and popular support. 

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and Flint 
officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of the KWA 
project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron intakes. This bid 

P.O. BOX 30716 • LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909 
www.michigan.gov/treasury • (517) 373-3200 



Page 2 


opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the KWA system. The bid 
was $3 -million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain them 
as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, pending review of 
any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a “supply only” rate schedule. Only water 
treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and operating 
revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA’s usage relative to the entire demand upon DWSD’s 
Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own transmission lines. 

The second option was a “full service” rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be calculated 
based upon KWA’s usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD’s final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of Environmental 
Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum annual 
rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 60 
MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given “broadened representation,” it is unclear 
exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to maintain its 
WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an adequate backup 
supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total cost of 
this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not clear, so 
analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. As 
such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

Senator Peters: 

As we continue to address ongoing issues related to the City of Flint's water, I want to make sure you 
are aware of the actions taken by the State of Michigan to ensure that the residents of Flint have access 
to safe, clean drinking water. These actions include: 

1. Immediately test Flint public schools to ensure that drinking water is safe. Testing also will be 
available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

2. Expand health exposure testing of individual residences. 

3. Offer water testing at no cost to Flint residents to assure water is safe. 

4. Begin optimizing corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 

5. Convene a "Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee" to ensure the best technology, 
practices and science are being utilized, and add an expert from the EPA's Office of Research 
and Development to the group. 

6. Accelerate water system improvements to address replacement of lead service lines. 

7. Expedite completion of Karegnondi Water Authority. 

8. Appointment of Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor. 

9. Provide water filters to residents of Flint. 

10. Expand a comprehensive lead education initiative. 

While these actions will mitigate the risk of lead exposure in the immediate and long term, there are a 
number of federal regulatory hurdles that impede our ability to further reduce risk. Accordingly, I would 
appreciate your assistance on the following federal items: 

1. Make federal Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds available for the replacement of private 
service lines. 

2. Ease and/or eliminate restrictions on the purchase of bottled water for SNAP and WIC 
recipients. This should include a temporary, targeted increase in SNAP benefits so that the 
purchase of bottled water does not count against a recipients' current SNAP allocation. 

3. Request that EPA expedite promulgation of the long term revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule. 

As the situation continues to evolve, I would also appreciate your assistance in the event that additional 
federal action is needed. 

Thank you for your continued efforts to ensure that the residents of Flint have access to safe, clean 
drinking water. I look forward to continuing to work with you on this and many other issues of 
importance to Michiganders. 


Sincerely,

SUBJECT: 

Flint Water System 

DATE: 

April 18, 2013 


Governor, this information was compiled by the Department of Treasury. 

Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, 
Inc. (TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & 
Sewer Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The 
purpose of this study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency 
Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the 
City of Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were 
presented: These options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of 
untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or 
provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and 
Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report 
by TYJT in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA's principal engineering firm regarding the others' 
conclusions and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the Office of Financial Review (OFR) provided a comprehensive report to the State 
Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the 
projections provided by Flint/KWA were acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; 
and 3) Identification of the options Flint will utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay 
in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA 
presented the best future option for future potable water. The OFR also concluded that KWA appeared 
to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee County appeared willing to 
assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA project could signify the 
beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and the KWA project 
had both political and popular support. 

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and 
Flint officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of 


1 




the KWA project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron 
intakes. This bid opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the 
KWA system. The bid was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain 
them as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, 
pending review of any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a "supply only" rate schedule. Only 
water treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and 
operating revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand 
upon DWSD's Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own 
transmission lines. 

The second option was a "full service" rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be 
calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD's final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum 
annual rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 
60 MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given "broadened representation," it is 
unclear exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to 
maintain its WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an 
adequate backup supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total 
cost of this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not 
clear, so analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. 
As such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA.

Flint Water System 

DATE:

Governor, this information was compiled by the Department of Treasury. 

Summary 

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, 
Inc. (TYJT) to analyze options for the City of Flint to either remain a customer of the Detroit Water & 
Sewer Department (DWSD) or to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) in Genesee County. The 
purpose of this study was to provide objective analyses to the State Treasurer and Flint's Emergency 
Financial Manager (EFM) in order to secure future potable drinking water for the City. 

In December 2012, staff from TYJT met with representatives from the Department of Treasury and the 
City of Flint to provide a preliminary report on their findings. At this meeting, five options were 
presented: These options ranged from the Flint Water Plant providing 100% water, to 100% provision of 
untreated Lake Huron Water by KWA, to 100% provision of treated drinking water by DWSD, or 
provision of variable amounts of water from DWSD using a combination of blended DWSD water and 
Flint River water. 

From the presentation of the preliminary report in December 2012 to the submission of the final report 
by TYJT in January 2013, a number of developments made arriving at a final decision very difficult. 

• DWSD provided the City of Flint with at least two modified proposals to consider. 

• A debate ensued between TYJT and KWA's principal engineering firm regarding the others' 
conclusions and estimates for construction of the KWA pipeline. 

• The Flint EFM eliminated all options except the 100% DWSD option or joining KWA. 

In January 2013, the Office of Financial Review (OFR) provided a comprehensive report to the State 
Treasurer analyzing three questions: 1) The projected construction costs and why Treasury believed the 
projections provided by Flint/KWA were acceptable; 2) Identification of the construction contingencies; 
and 3) Identification of the options Flint will utilize in the event of a construction cost overrun or a delay 
in construction. At the end of this report, the OFR recommended to the State Treasurer that KWA 
presented the best future option for future potable water. The OFR also concluded that KWA appeared 
to be the cheaper option; the quality of water would improve; Genesee County appeared willing to 
assist the City in securing the financing for their portion of the project; the KWA project could signify the 
beginning of better collaboration between the City of Flint and Genesee County; and the KWA project 
had both political and popular support. 

Between January and April, intense scrutiny of the various proposals was undertaken by Treasury and 
Flint officials. Treasury officials met with officials from Genesee County to gain a better understanding of 


1 




the KWA project. In February 2013, Genesee County opened bids for construction of the Lake Huron 
intakes. This bid opening represented the first meaningful step toward commencing construction of the 
KWA system. The bid was $3-million less than projected. 

In March 2013, Treasury was notified that DWSD had contacted Flint to negotiate with the City to retain 
them as a customer. On April 12, 2013, the State Treasurer authorized the Flint EFM to join KWA, 
pending review of any final offer from DWSD. A final offer was received from DWSD on April 15, 2013. 

DWSD's final offer provided two options. The first option was for a "supply only" rate schedule. Only 
water treatment costs would be recovered and DWDS would absorb all other delivery costs. Capital and 
operating revenue charges would be calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand 
upon DWSD's Lake Huron WTP. KWA would also have the ability to construct and own its own 
transmission lines. 

The second option was a "full service" rate option. DWSD would provide all production and transmission 
services. Transmission rates would be calculated only on those costs necessary to supply KWA and no 
additional transmission rates would be charged. Capital and operating revenue charges would be 
calculated based upon KWA's usage relative to the entire demand upon the Lake Huron WTP. 

Independent analyses of DWSD's final offer by the OFR, the Flint EFM, and the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) generally reached the same conclusions: 

• DWSD's offer was a framework subject to negotiations and was not a firm offer. 

• The offer provided by DWSD was incomplete. 

• DWSD's offer did not include a guaranteed rate beyond year one, nor did it limit maximum 
annual rate increases. 

• The DWSD scenarios were based on 40 MGD of service capacity. However, the KWA project provides 
60 MGD of initial capacity with potential expansion to 75 MGD. 

• DWSD indicates that Flint/ Genesee County would be given "broadened representation," it is 
unclear exactly what this means in terms of actual control in the decision making processes. 

• The DWSD offer relies on a single transmission system and would require the City of Flint to 
maintain its WTP for emergency purposes. In addition, it would leave Genesee County without an 
adequate backup supply to meet their needs. 

• DWSD's offer included an attachment that listed the rank-ordered options (from cheapest to most 
expensive). DWSD Scenario 2 is listed as the least expensive option (but it is unclear how the total 
cost of this option was arrived at). DWSD Scenario 1 was not listed. 

• DWSD provided a summary table of their unit costs but how these figures are arrived at was not 
clear, so analysis proved difficult. 

Without specific details from DWSD on this proposal, a true comparative analysis is difficult to provide. 
As such the Flint EFM rejected the DWSD proposal and agreed to join KWA. 

If further information on this issue is needed, please let me know.

In November 2012 the Department of Treasury commissioned the firm of Tucker, Young, Jackson & Tull, Inc.

Congressman Kildee: 

As part of our ongoing dialogue related to the City of Flint’s water ! want to make sure you are aware of 
the actions taken by the State of Michigan to ensure that the residents of Flint have access to safe, clean 
drinking water. These actions include: 

1 immediately testing Flint's public school district to ensure that drinking water is safe. Testing also 
will be available at no cost to any other school in Flint. 

2. Expanding health exposure testing of Individual residences, 

3. Offering water testing at no cost to Flint residents to assure the water is safe. 

4. Begin optimizing corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system. 

5. Convening a ' Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee” to ensure the best technology, 
practices, and science are being utilized. This Committee will Include an expert from the EPA’s 
Office of Research and Development 

6. Accelerating water system improvements to address replacement of lead service lines.

8. Appointing Dr. Eden Weils as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor. 

9. Providing water filters to residents of Flint. 

10. Expanding a comprehensive lead education initiative.

X Make federal Drinking Water Revolving Loan funds available for the replacement of private 
service lines. 

2. Ease and/or eliminate restrictions on the purchase of bottled water for SN AP and WIG recipients, 
This should include a temporary,, targeted increase in SNAP benefits so that the purchase of 
bottled water does not count against a recipients' current SNAP allocation.

Rule. 

As the situation continues to evolve, I: would also appreciate your assistance in the event that additional

Hi John- Dave asked me to send you the internal email and statement we issued last week. This makes our messaging on 
Dan's departure clear. 


Let me know if you have any questions. 


Laura 

Email: 

Team, 

As you are aware, we have been working closely with the independent taskforce that has been reviewing state, local and 
federal actions regarding the serious health issues related to water in Flint. 

Although the task force's final report is not yet complete, members have made the Governor aware of some interim 
findings, and there are interim steps the Governor has decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how we in 
state government keep residents safe and informed. 

As part of this process, Dan Wyant, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, has offered his resignation, and 
Governor has reluctantly decided to accept it. There are likely to be other personnel changes in MDEQ as well. 

I want to thank Dan for his service. He has been the DEQ director since the start of the administration, and previously 
headed the Agriculture Department under both Gov. Engler and Gov. Granholm. He is passionate about public service 
and protecting our state's environment. 

The situation in Flint is serious and challenging. We will continue to work closely with the taskforce and city leaders as 
we move forward, committed to protecting the health of people living in Flint and around our state. 

Sincerely, 

Jarrod Agen 

Press release: 


Changes to take place at DEQ, meeting planned with Mayor Karen Weaver

In response to initial findings from the Flint Water Task Force, Gov. Rick Snyder today issued the following 
statement: 


"When I became aware that the city of Flint's water showed elevated lead levels and that the state's handling of 
the situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch the source back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority and appointed an independent task force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 

"The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and interviewing scores of Flint, 
Genesee County, state and federal officials. Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, 
members have made me aware of some interim findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take 
immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe and informed. 

"We'll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns. 

"In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I've determined that it's appropriate to 
accept it. I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force. 

"But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the 
scientific community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health 
and Human Services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping 
us improve Flint water. Let's share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at accurate 
and mutually supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we're using the very best testing 
protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe drinking water and that we're taking steps to protect their health 
over the short and long term. 

"I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan 
citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging 
infrastructure. 

"I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That's why I'm taking the actions today to 
ensure a culture of openness and trust. We've already allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water 
filters, and help in other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we're going to meet soon to 
discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

"These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the recommendations of our task 
force. When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, we're committed to doing everything we can to 
protect the well-being of our citizens."

Hi Jean, I'd still like to have this conversation with Keith if John thinks it's appropriate. Keith is very engaged in 
the water strategy and would have good insights on if we can influence its final production.

The meeting is at the Romney Building - 3 rd F-L Policy Conf. Room, Can you just change it on your calendar. Not sure 
why it is showing Flint, as that is not on my end. I will talk to John about how he wants to handle this meeting and get

Hi Jean, 

This is odd, but for some reason the January 7, 9:00 meeting with John Walsh and Angela Ayers 
says the location is City of Flint on my end. Maybe it doesn’t show that on your end of the calendar? 
Since Dan has left, do you want to have this meeting with Keith? I don’t have full access to Keith’s 
calendar yet but I can check to see if this will work for him. 

Please advise. Thanks. Happy New Year. 

Mary Beth

MEMORANDUM 

Date: December 4, 2015 

To: John Walsh 

From: Angela Ayers 
RE: Water Strategy Ideas 


Michigan's Water Strategy is a unique opportunity to align state agencies, communities, local 
governments and various stakeholder groups around a common vision for enhancing environmental and 
economic opportunities of our water resources. We are the Great Lakes state. Our water strategy should 
match our passion for our water resources. As currently proposed, this document will be a missed 
opportunity. 

The vision outlined in the current strategy is weak, at best. "Michigan's water resources support a 
healthy environment, healthy citizens, vibrant communities and sustainable economies." A vision 
statement should clarify the purpose of the document and inform direction. A grand vision goes a step 
further and helps to ignite action in others. 

The current Water Strategy is a self-described "30-year vision" and "strategy for all people of Michigan." 
It identifies a vision, four core values, nine goals, and 62 recommendations (22 of which are "key 
recommendations"), but does not prioritize the information for any group or entity, nor for any 
timeframe. While it documents the important actions all water-based stakeholders are currently taking 
or must take to ensure future water quality and economic prosperity (along with measures of success 
and methods to track results), its current design is too broad to derive any inherent value. It lacks clarity 
and direction. 

If we can slightly finesse the document to provide some additional clarity in, at a minimum, the State's 
role in aligning priorities and how the State will use the document in its decision making, it will increase 
its value to not only our stakeholders, but ourselves as well. 

Here are some ideas for consideration: 

• Refine the vision to provide clarity on the purpose of the document and ignite action in others. 
Example: 

o The State of Michigan capitalizes on its unique connection to the Great Lakes and all its 
water assets by aligning resources to ignite economic opportunities and provide an 
unparalleled quality of life for all people 

• Include statements in the introduction to provide context to the vision. Examples include: 

o Water is helping Michigan in its reputation as the Comeback State, 
o Placemaking is becoming ever more important to our communities. People want to live 
in a high quality of life location. Michigan is a high value quality of life location. And our 
vast water resources are a large part of the reason why. 
o Leveraging Michigan's water resources as an integral part of a community's quality of 
life will help attract and retain our workforce of today and tomorrow. Technology is 
changing the culture and working habits of our workforce. Telecommuting and working 
remotely are more commonplace, which has released the workforce from the office

building, allowing greater choice on where individuals are working. This trend has 
increased the decisions of where employees will work. Instead of living near their place 
of employment, employees are choosing to live in areas with high quality of life values. 

o Water is the primary component of the Pure Michigan experience. We are known for 
our water. Leveraging our unique connection with our vast water resources will ignite 
economic development opportunities in our communities while providing an 
unparalleled quality of life for all. We are the Great Lakes state. 

• Identify the top 6 specific goals the state will focus on in the next 5 years. This will send a 
message to stakeholders of where to focus their own actions and provide a more solid direction 
towards implementation. The nine goals currently listed in the strategy are so broad they are 
more categorical descriptions rather than goals. Specificity and clarity are key. 

• Earlier this year, OGL, DNR and DEQ identified the top 6 goals the State will focus on, however 
this is not indicated in the Strategy. These goals are only known to the Governor's Office and 
State Departments as priorities they will focus on. By pulling out clear and specific goals in the 
Strategy, this will create an urgency around a more narrow set of objectives, resulting in 
increased action by stakeholders (legislators, local and regional governments, NGOs, university 
programs and research, industry groups, businesses, etc.). Everyone will be in the same boats, 
rowing in the same direction. 

• The top 6 goals currently identified are: 

o Prevent introduction of new AIS and control established populations. 

o Achieve a 40% phosphorus in western Lake Erie basin. 

o Support investments in commercial and recreational harbors and address long-term 
maritime infrastructure needs. 

o Develop and implement a water trails system. 

o Accelerate water technologies to solve water problems using an entrepreneurial 
business-led initiative. 

o Establish a Water Fund to achieve Water Strategy goals including water infrastructure 
management. 

• In addition, we should also consider adding a seventh goal related to safe drinking water. 

• Include statements in the introduction to clearly articulate the purpose and direction of the 
document. Explain what we will be doing around these 6 key areas and how others can do the 
same. Examples include: 

o Michigan's state agencies will work together to align resources around these six/seven 
key areas of focus to increase capacity throughout the state by (for example): 

■ Prioritizing projects for grant funding 

■ Increased scoring in loan funding 

■ Conduct a thorough review of state policies and programs around these three 
focus areas to enhance efficiencies and increase access to funding 

■ Work with stakeholders and communities to address regional and local issues 
around these three focus areas 

o The State of Michigan will use this strategy in our decision making related to water 
policies and programs 

o We envision our numerous partners using this document to prioritize and influence 
their individual goals and objectives related to water management. In the short-term,

stakeholders can align their actions around the three key focus areas, while they work 
towards the full complement of 62 recommendations. 

• Keep the core values, nine goals and 62 recommendations. 

• If we're going to keep the 22 key recommendations, we should say what we want done with 
them. It's not clear what will be done differently with these 22 versus the 62.
