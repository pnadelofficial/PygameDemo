EMERGENCY MANAGER 


NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A four-month plan has been developed, listing the priorities to be accomplished for the 
remainder of EM Coulter’s term and beyond. 

The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015, shows a further decline in pension 
funding down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed a lawsuit against the 
State of Michigan, Department of Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the 
reduction of city retiree healthcare. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, Connecticut, accepted the position of City 
Manager. His contract has been finalized and he will begin work October 1, 2015.

Lincoln Park (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 15 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $636K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Last May voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by 
a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative plan under provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to 
manage and operate the retirement system. A request for up to six mills per year to fund 
public safety pensions will be placed on the November ballot. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabili z e pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 


FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The Detroit City Council reconsidered the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s 
proposed FY 16 water and sewer rate increase and approved it on July 21, 2015. This 
action eliminated a potential budget deficit, which was a concern raised by the State 
Treasurer in his July 2, 2015 letter to the city. 

The city issued its FY 14 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) on June 30, 
2015 (following two three-month extensions granted by the State Treasurer). The city 
continued to have a deficit for FY 14 as that year closed prior to the bankruptcy 
confirmation in December 2014. The city expects to report a surplus in its FY 15 CAFR, 
which is currently underway and expected to be completed no later than March 2016. 

At the FRC’s July 27, 2015 meeting, the city indicated it would reduce its bankruptcy 
exit financing debt by $30M (from $275M to $245M) prior to its scheduled syndication 
in mid-August. The State Treasurer and FRC Executive Director are participating in the 
city’s rating agency and investor presentations to discuss the State’s oversight role. 

On July 29 and July 30, 2015, the city received its first post-bankruptcy credit ratings 
from S&P and Moody’s. Only S&P rated the city’s exit financing, for which it received 
an investment-grade “A” rating, with a stable outlook. The exit financing is secured by a 
statutory lien on city income tax revenue. Both rating agencies provided the city with 
updated underlying General Obligation (GO) ratings. S&P assigned a “B” rating, with a 
stable outlook. Moody’s upgraded the city from “B3” to “B2,” with a positive outlook. 



Page 3 


Detroit (continued) 

Significant Action/Issues 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the FRC on May 28, 
2015. The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its 
appointment in November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in 
December 2015. 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 


RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The City Council has approved a new, four-year collective bargaining agreement with the 
police bargaining unit. Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and had a number of 
concerns with the terms including the identification of over $237 K in increased costs in 
Year 1. Despite these concerns, the RTAB voted 2 to 1 to ratify the approval of these 
collective bargaining agreements. 

The city wishes to seek bids for retiree health insurance coverage after being informed by 
Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K will become effective October 1, 2015. 
The RTAB has approved this request and Treasury is working with the city to identify 
potential legal ramifications in the lawsuit with retirees if coverage is changed to a new 
provider. 

The city was informed by Blue Cross that a billing oversight has resulted in the city 
underpaying for insurance coverage for retirees in the amount of $853K. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
The RTAB approved this item on August 5, 2015. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury is participating in the selection 
process. The City Council will be interviewing the finalists for the position in August 
2015. 

Completion of the bond tender process is projected for August 2015. The 2015 
Refunding Bonds will be rated Single A, due to the city’s pledge of distributable state 
aid. 



Page 4 


Standard & Poor’s released its rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the 
bond tender release. The city’s long-term rating for the existing bonds was downgraded 
with a negative outlook. The downgrade of these bonds is similar to the rating by 
Standard and Poor’s on the City of Detroit’s DWSD tender refinancing. 



Page 5 


Allen Park (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. A Settlement Conference was held between all parties on July 20, 2015, but no 
resolution was achieved. The court has ordered mediation proceedings. 

The city’s current budget is balanced. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city completed its move to a new temporary City Hall on June 8, 2015. 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on May 26, 2015, and the RTAB approved 
this action on June 3, 2015. 

- Inquiries are being made to add one member to the RTAB. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. 

- TAt-Large Commissioner Mary Donald passed away on June 12, 2015. On August 10, 
2015, the City Commission appointed Edward Isom to finish her unexpired term, which 
ends December 31, 2015. On August 11, 2015, the RTAB approved the appointment. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

The City Commission adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 15, 2015. The RTAB approved 
this action on June 22, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 



Page 6 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The city has completed a balanced five-year financial plan. One challenge includes the 
outsourcing of fire services which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan 
solvent. This is the first time the city has proposed a viable path out of receivership. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have promised. 

The RTAB approved the city’s choice for city controller at the August meeting. Tim 
Sadowski will commence work later this month. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. 
Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing PA 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

At a special meeting held on August 11, 2015, the City Council approved the transfer of 
$323K from the Fire Department to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol 
officers. The RTAB approved this transfer on August 12, 2015. 

On August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court invalidated the city’s 35 percent water 
and sewer rate increases which were reverted back to 2011 rates. This decision could 
potentially could cost the City’s General Fund up to $50M. The city expects to receive a 
final order from the Circuit Court on August 17, 2015, and is prepared to file an 
emergency appeal to the Court of Appeals. The City Administrator has instituted hiring 
and spending freezes across all departments, and Treasury is working with the city to 
identify the impact from this decision. 

In addition, on August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an 
emergency injunction that prevents the city from further charging water service fees, 
instituted on all water bills to recoup funds used to settle a 2007 lawsuit. The ruling 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund. The ruling 
also prohibits the city from disconnecting water service for late payment and prevents the 
city from placing liens on property for past due water bills. The city plans to appeal this 
decision. 



Page 7 


Flint (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

The City Council approved an amendment to the EM adopted FY 15 Budget on June 29, 
2015. The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $495K General Fund balance. The 
RTAB denied the budget amendment at their July 15, 2015 meeting because the City 
Council also approved the use of $200K of the city’s $495K General Fund balance for 
grass and weed abatement throughout the city. The City Council reconsidered and 
adopted the budget amendments, which were approved by the RTAB on August 12, 
2015. The City Administrator has also developed a plan to allocate additional resources 
toward grass and weed abatement. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB approved the issuance of an Obsolete Property 
Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) certificate for a downtown property. The City Council had 
initially rejected issuance of the OPRA certificate but an EM Order permits the RTAB to 
make the final determination on economic development projects. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB also approved ballot language for the renewal of the 
Regional Flint Mass Transportation Authority millage. The renewal is proposed for five 
years at the current 0.6 mills per year. This proposal will appear on the November 2015 
ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 2015, to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. Another 
lawsuit to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit was filed in Genesee 
County Circuit Court on July 16, 2015. 

The city’s Economic and Community Development Director is leaving in August 2015. 
Current staffing vacancies also include the City Treasurer and the Human Resources 
Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statute and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city is preparing to issue an RFP for a reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are 
completely installed and will be in use by August 17, 2015. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project commenced on August 10, 2015. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
75% complete and the intake should be completed in August 2015. 



Page 8 


Flint (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Administrator has issued a Corrective Action Plan to the City Clerk to correct a 
number of operational deficiencies that resulted in the wrong election submission dates 
being provided to local candidates. 

On June 12, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a decision by Genesee 
County Circuit Judge Richard Yuille, who dismissed a claim that the city violated its own 
ordinances when the EM raised water and sewer rates in 201 1. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city is undertaking a $7M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into the 
sanitary sewers. 

The City is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators reduce the 
overtime rates. 

A contractor is reassessing both residential and commercial properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvement 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

On July 18, 2015, the City Council approved the recommendation of the Local Officer

which frees up $2M in demolition funds. 



Page 9 


Pontiac (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On June 18, 2015, the City Council adopted the proposed FY 16 Budget and 2015 tax 
rates. The RTAB held a special meeting on June 26, 2015, to approve the proposed FY 
16 Budget and 2015 tax rates. 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the Gray & Company Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary 
private equity fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC 
proceedings, its effects on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with 
Gray’s firm. The Pension Board has withdrawn its pension assets from Gray & Company 
controlled funds. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 


CONSENT AGREEMENT

On June 29, 2015, a tentative agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a 
judgment levy starting with the December 2015 tax roll, for five years, to repay the 
county $4.9M in past due sewer charges. The city would like to postpone the levy until 
2016 and are in discussions with Wayne County.

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

On August 4, 2015, voters approved a renewal of 4.5 mills for general operations.

employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. The county has not yet proposed a long- 
term solution to its jail problems.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 


NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund Balance. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015 shows a further decline in pension 
funding, down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes are to be implemented in July 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K annually. 

City Manager interviews have been conducted. Mathew Coppler, City Manager of 
Enfield, Connecticut was offered the position and accepted. Contract discussions are 
underway. 

The Lincoln Park Retiree Associations have filed a Notice of Claim against the State of 
Michigan, Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree 
healthcare. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal last month 
by a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative plan under provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to 
manage and operate the retirement system. If successful, a request for seven mills per 
year to fund public safety pensions will be placed on the November ballot. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 
Police CBAs must be finalized.

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

In reaction to the June 30, 2015 vote by Detroit City Council against increasing rates on 
water and sewerage costs, the Chairman of the FRC and State Treasurer, sent a letter to 
Detroit’s Mayor and City Council on July 2, 2015. The purpose of the letter was to ask 
the Mayor and City Council to provide the FRC with either the necessary information to 
demonstrate the city’s plan to comply with the approved budget for FY 16, or the basis 
upon which the city will seek an amendment to the FY 16 budget. If the vote is not 
reversed, this action will result in the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Enterprise 
Fund being in a deficit position for FY 16. 

At the FRC’s June 22, 2015 meeting, the city provided an update on the syndication of 
the city’s $275M bankruptcy exit financing. The city may elect to repay a portion of the 
exit refinancing before the public offering, which is expected to occur in mid-August, 
and will report back to the FRC at the July 27, 2015 meeting. 

The most intense work the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restructuring initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

Significant Action/Issues 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the Financial Review 
Commission (FRC) on May 28, 2015. The report detailed the FRC’s activities and 
formal requirements since its appointment in November 2014. The FRC will file its 
second biannual report in December 2015. 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017.

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on May 26, 2015. It was approved by the 
RTAB on June 3, 2015. 

The city completed its move to a new temporary City Hall on June 8, 2015. Final 
inspections are scheduled for July 17, 2015. 

The city met with the police bargaining unit and is considering a one-year extension to 
the CBA. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
The RTAB will be considering this item at their July 22, 2015 meeting. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury will participate in the selection 
process. Initial screening of applicants is expected to begin in July 2015. 

Completion of the bond tender process is projected for August 2015. The 2015 
Refunding Bonds will be rated Single A, due to the city’s pledge of distributable state 
aide. 

Standard & Poor’s released its rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the 
bond tender release. The city’s long-term rating for the existing bonds was downgraded 
with a negative outlook. The downgrading for these bonds is similar to the rating by 
Standard and Poor’s on the City of Detroit’s DWSD tender refinancing. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- There’s a need to add one member to the RTAB to find additional Allen Park area 
diversity. 

In April, the RTAB approved creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator position 
to oversee city operations until the bond tender and City Hall projects are complete. 
Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, was appointed to this 
position. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 budget on June 15, 2015. The RTAB approved the 
FY 16 budget on June 22, 2015. 

There is a vacancy on the City Commission due to the passing of Commissioner Mary 
Donald. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange has brought a Whistleblower 
and Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former 
Emergency Manager Tony Saunders. The mediation is expected to take place on July 17, 
2015 with Jon March of Miller Johnson serving as the mediator. 

The Finance Director, Deputy Finance Director, several Public Safety Officers, and two 
Public Works Department employees have resigned due to other employment 
opportunities. 



Page 4 


The first annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in July. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. To balance the budget, the city 
increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 

The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months), 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. The Mayor has 
submitted a letter of protest, disagreeing with this RTAB decision, and Treasurer Khouri 
met with him on June 26, 2015. Treasury is considering changes to the final EM Order 
as a result of that meeting. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. Many 
of the deficiencies recognized in the first annual evaluation are expected to be noted in 
this evaluation as well. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

The City Council approved an amendment to the EM adopted FY 15 budget on June 29, 
2015. The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $495K General Fund balance. The 
RTAB will be reviewing the budget amendment at their July 15, 2015 meeting. 

The City Administrator has issued a Corrective Action Plan to the City Clerk to correct a 
number of operational deficiencies that resulted in the wrong election submission dates 
being provided to local candidates. 



Page 5 


Legislation has been signed that will allow candidates who submitted petitions by April 
28, 2015 to have their names placed on the August Primary ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 2015, to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 

On June 12, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a decision by Genesee 
County Circuit Judge Richard Yuille, who dismissed a claim that the city violated its own 
ordinances when the Emergency Manager raised water and sewer rates in 201 1. 

The RTAB held its first meeting on June 11, 2015. Jodi Lundquist has assumed the 
position of CFO. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statute and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city will be issuing an RFP for a reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be 
completed in mid- July. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project is scheduled to begin in July 2015. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
75% complete and the intake should be completed in August 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved the 
Budget on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvement 
plan. 

The city is undertaking a $7M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into the 
sanitary sewers. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the Emergency Manager’s two-year 
budget.

Recent Developments 

Treasury staff met with members of the City Council on June 22, 2015 and June 23, 2015 
to discuss the RTAB and transition to local control. 

On June 18, 2015 the City Council adopted the proposed FY 16 budget and 2015 tax 
rates. The RTAB held a special meeting on June 26, 2015 to approve the proposed FY 16 
budget and 2015 tax rates. 

Initial screening of Deputy Mayor Candidates will begin in July. Treasury will 
participate in the selection process. 

The city lost the Supreme Court ruling on efforts to demolish the Phoenix Center. 
Treasury is working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator 
which frees up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the Gray Co Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary private equity 
fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC proceedings, its effects 
on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with Gray’s firm. The Pension 
Board is reviewing options for withdrawal of pension assets from Grayson controlled 
funds. 

On May 20, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. The amendment was adopted by City Council in April with no prior analysis 
or actuarial study being conducted. The best available estimates indicate an impact to the 
pension system of approximately $9-$13M per year. The ordinance amendment was sent 
back to committee for further review. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

On May 5, 2015, the city’s Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 55% to 45% 
margin. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance is 
approximately $5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’ s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker.

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

The City Council approved the FY 16 budget on May 18, 2015. 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement has been placed on the July tax roll 
by a judgement levy. 

Three Police Chief candidates were interviewed on June 11, 2015. There was a difference 
in opinion on the preferred candidate. Subsequently, contract negotiations with William 
Riley, Police Chief of Selma, Alabama are underway. 

On June 1, 2015, an Order was issued requiring the City Treasurer to approve all 
employment matters with city officials and employees, expenditure of funds, and all 
contracts. 

On June 29, 2015, an agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a judgment 
levy starting with the December 2015 tax roll, for five years, to repay the county $4.9M 
in past due sewer charges. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

The city adopted its FY 16 budget on May 19, 2015. The budget is balanced at 
$9,839,808. The city has prepared a proposed five-year budget that shows a deficit in FY 
18 to FY 20 unless additional revenues can be found. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A fire union CBA was approved in March, resulting in a reduction in healthcare costs. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The Township Supervisor recently provided a legal opinion from a former Township 
Attorney that the Township Board could legally spend the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets received from MERS for capital improvement projects. A previous 
Consent Agreement Order prevented spending of these funds. The Township Board did 



Page 8 


not request this legal opinion. Treasury is assisting the Consultant in investigating this 
matter. 

An Order was issued on June 17, 2015, granting the Consultant broad authority to 
approve expenditures made by the township and ensure that obligations are being paid. 
The Order also gives the Consultant authority to return the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets to MERS. 

Treasury has requested a work plan from the Consultant on how the township’s Finance 
and Operating Plan will be implemented over the next six months. 

A report issued by the Rehmann Group, the township’s financial consultant, noted that 
the township must make budget adjustments of $164,275 to its FY 15 General Fund 
budget to account for expenditures exceeding revenues in FY 14. The township adopted 
budget amendments on May 28, 2015 and implementation is pending. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. An Order 
was issued May 20, 2015 requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 
prior to authorization. 

On May 11, 2015, Oakland County approved proposed ballot language for AVi mills for 
the township’s general operations. The current millage expires December 31, 2015. The 
election is scheduled for August 4, 2015. 

The City of Detroit has declined to provide police services to the township. Proposals 
from the cities of Ferndale and Hazel Park have been determined to be too expensive. 
The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township in the 
interim. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 
Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
P.A. 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

On June 29, 2015, the City Council approved a substantial increase in water and sewer 
rates which will enable the city to provide funding for water and sewer operations. 

On July 6, 2015, Wade Trim took over the operation and maintenance of the water and 
sewer systems. 

Mr. Fouis Schimmel was hired on June 29, 2015, to provide consulting services 
regarding water and sewer issues. 

The city will issue an RFP in July to contract-out the collection of past due water and 
sewer bills from residential and commercial customers. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. A Wayne County Circuit Judge issued a 
temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water 
service to the city. The city was granted a stay on the $20M judgement levy on June 3, 
2015. 



Page 9 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council adopted a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under MDOT’s jurisdiction in the 
city. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a consultant’s recommendation for an amnesty 
plan for residential customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. The consultant 
has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, the city could 
collect S2.08M. The city has extended the amnesty plan until July 31, 2015. This will 
allow more time for customers to pay past due accounts. 

There are concerns about the city’s ability to successfully implement health insurance 
cost reductions as planned in FY 15. 

The city’s liabilities total $99. 9M. Some major components are: $55. 3M debt, including 
$20.7M owed to the DWSD, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits 
(OPEB). 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 
Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

On June 10, 2015 the county reached a settlement with retirees on healthcare. The 
county will no longer provide health insurance but will instead provide a stipend to 
retirees. This will result in a savings of $20M annually. 

On June 17, 2015 the Wayne County Executive requested a preliminary review under the 
Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, Public Act 436 of 2012. After notification to 
the county, the Department began its preliminary review of the County’s finances on 
June 19, 2015. A final preliminary review report was issued on June 30, 2015. 

On July 1, 2015 the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board met and found 
that probable financial stress exists in the county. 

On July 2, 2015, a five member review team was appointed. The review team met with 
various county officials, commissioners, personnel, and union representatives July 9 and 
10, 2015. A recommendation regarding the declaration of financial emergency will be 
forthcoming within seven to ten days. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The county’s annual structural General Fund deficit is approximately $52M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $53M in General Fund savings, 
$25M of which comes from changes to pension and healthcare benefits for active 
employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. The county has not yet proposed a long- 
term solution to its jail problems.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 


NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund Balance. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015 shows a further decline in pension 
funding, down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes are to be implemented in July 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K annually. 

City Manager interviews have been conducted. Mathew Coppler, City Manager of 
Enfield, Connecticut was offered the position and accepted. Contract discussions are 
underway. 

The Lincoln Park Retiree Associations have filed a Notice of Claim against the State of 
Michigan, Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree 
healthcare. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal last month 
by a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative plan under provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to 
manage and operate the retirement system. If successful, a request for seven mills per 
year to fund public safety pensions will be placed on the November ballot. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 
Police CBAs must be finalized.

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

In reaction to the June 30, 2015 vote by Detroit City Council against increasing rates on 
water and sewerage costs, the Chairman of the FRC and State Treasurer, sent a letter to 
Detroit’s Mayor and City Council on July 2, 2015. The purpose of the letter was to ask 
the Mayor and City Council to provide the FRC with either the necessary information to 
demonstrate the city’s plan to comply with the approved budget for FY 16, or the basis 
upon which the city will seek an amendment to the FY 16 budget. If the vote is not 
reversed, this action will result in the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Enterprise 
Fund being in a deficit position for FY 16. 

At the FRC’s June 22, 2015 meeting, the city provided an update on the syndication of 
the city’s $275M bankruptcy exit financing. The city may elect to repay a portion of the 
exit refinancing before the public offering, which is expected to occur in mid-August, 
and will report back to the FRC at the July 27, 2015 meeting. 

The most intense work the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restructuring initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

Significant Action/Issues 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the Financial Review 
Commission (FRC) on May 28, 2015. The report detailed the FRC’s activities and 
formal requirements since its appointment in November 2014. The FRC will file its 
second biannual report in December 2015. 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017.

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on May 26, 2015. It was approved by the 
RTAB on June 3, 2015. 

The city completed its move to a new temporary City Hall on June 8, 2015. Final 
inspections are scheduled for July 17, 2015. 

The city met with the police bargaining unit and is considering a one-year extension to 
the CBA. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
The RTAB will be considering this item at their July 22, 2015 meeting. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury will participate in the selection 
process. Initial screening of applicants is expected to begin in July 2015. 

Completion of the bond tender process is projected for August 2015. The 2015 
Refunding Bonds will be rated Single A, due to the city’s pledge of distributable state 
aide. 

Standard & Poor’s released its rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the 
bond tender release. The city’s long-term rating for the existing bonds was downgraded 
with a negative outlook. The downgrading for these bonds is similar to the rating by 
Standard and Poor’s on the City of Detroit’s DWSD tender refinancing. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- There’s a need to add one member to the RTAB to find additional Allen Park area 
diversity. 

In April, the RTAB approved creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator position 
to oversee city operations until the bond tender and City Hall projects are complete. 
Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, was appointed to this 
position. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 budget on June 15, 2015. The RTAB approved the 
FY 16 budget on June 22, 2015. 

There is a vacancy on the City Commission due to the passing of Commissioner Mary 
Donald. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange has brought a Whistleblower 
and Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former 
Emergency Manager Tony Saunders. The mediation is expected to take place on July 17, 
2015 with Jon March of Miller Johnson serving as the mediator. 

The Finance Director, Deputy Finance Director, several Public Safety Officers, and two 
Public Works Department employees have resigned due to other employment 
opportunities.

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in July. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. To balance the budget, the city 
increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 

The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months), 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. The Mayor has 
submitted a letter of protest, disagreeing with this RTAB decision, and Treasurer Khouri 
met with him on June 26, 2015. Treasury is considering changes to the final EM Order 
as a result of that meeting. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. Many 
of the deficiencies recognized in the first annual evaluation are expected to be noted in 
this evaluation as well. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015

Recent Developments 

The City Council approved an amendment to the EM adopted FY 15 budget on June 29, 
2015. The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $495K General Fund balance. The 
RTAB will be reviewing the budget amendment at their July 15, 2015 meeting. 

The City Administrator has issued a Corrective Action Plan to the City Clerk to correct a 
number of operational deficiencies that resulted in the wrong election submission dates 
being provided to local candidates.

Legislation has been signed that will allow candidates who submitted petitions by April 
28, 2015 to have their names placed on the August Primary ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 2015, to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 

On June 12, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a decision by Genesee 
County Circuit Judge Richard Yuille, who dismissed a claim that the city violated its own 
ordinances when the Emergency Manager raised water and sewer rates in 201 1. 

The RTAB held its first meeting on June 11, 2015. Jodi Lundquist has assumed the 
position of CFO. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statute and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city will be issuing an RFP for a reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be 
completed in mid- July. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project is scheduled to begin in July 2015. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
75% complete and the intake should be completed in August 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues

assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved the 
Budget on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvement 
plan. 

The city is undertaking a $7M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into the 
sanitary sewers. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the Emergency Manager’s two-year 
budget.

Treasury staff met with members of the City Council on June 22, 2015 and June 23, 2015 
to discuss the RTAB and transition to local control. 

On June 18, 2015 the City Council adopted the proposed FY 16 budget and 2015 tax 
rates. The RTAB held a special meeting on June 26, 2015 to approve the proposed FY 16 
budget and 2015 tax rates.

The city lost the Supreme Court ruling on efforts to demolish the Phoenix Center. 
Treasury is working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator 
which frees up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the Gray Co Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary private equity 
fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC proceedings, its effects 
on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with Gray’s firm. The Pension 
Board is reviewing options for withdrawal of pension assets from Grayson controlled 
funds. 

On May 20, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. The amendment was adopted by City Council in April with no prior analysis 
or actuarial study being conducted. The best available estimates indicate an impact to the 
pension system of approximately $9-$13M per year. The ordinance amendment was sent 
back to committee for further review. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

On May 5, 2015, the city’s Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 55% to 45% 
margin. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance is 
approximately $5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’ s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker.

The City Council approved the FY 16 budget on May 18, 2015. 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement has been placed on the July tax roll 
by a judgement levy. 

Three Police Chief candidates were interviewed on June 11, 2015. There was a difference 
in opinion on the preferred candidate. Subsequently, contract negotiations with William 
Riley, Police Chief of Selma, Alabama are underway. 

On June 1, 2015, an Order was issued requiring the City Treasurer to approve all 
employment matters with city officials and employees, expenditure of funds, and all 
contracts. 

On June 29, 2015, an agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a judgment 
levy starting with the December 2015 tax roll, for five years, to repay the county $4.9M 
in past due sewer charges. 

Significant Actions/Issues

Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

The city adopted its FY 16 budget on May 19, 2015. The budget is balanced at 
$9,839,808. The city has prepared a proposed five-year budget that shows a deficit in FY 
18 to FY 20 unless additional revenues can be found. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A fire union CBA was approved in March, resulting in a reduction in healthcare costs. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The Township Supervisor recently provided a legal opinion from a former Township 
Attorney that the Township Board could legally spend the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets received from MERS for capital improvement projects. A previous 
Consent Agreement Order prevented spending of these funds. The Township Board did 



Page 8 


not request this legal opinion. Treasury is assisting the Consultant in investigating this 
matter. 

An Order was issued on June 17, 2015, granting the Consultant broad authority to 
approve expenditures made by the township and ensure that obligations are being paid. 
The Order also gives the Consultant authority to return the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets to MERS. 

Treasury has requested a work plan from the Consultant on how the township’s Finance 
and Operating Plan will be implemented over the next six months. 

A report issued by the Rehmann Group, the township’s financial consultant, noted that 
the township must make budget adjustments of $164,275 to its FY 15 General Fund 
budget to account for expenditures exceeding revenues in FY 14. The township adopted 
budget amendments on May 28, 2015 and implementation is pending. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. An Order 
was issued May 20, 2015 requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 
prior to authorization. 

On May 11, 2015, Oakland County approved proposed ballot language for AVi mills for 
the township’s general operations. The current millage expires December 31, 2015. The 
election is scheduled for August 4, 2015. 

The City of Detroit has declined to provide police services to the township. Proposals 
from the cities of Ferndale and Hazel Park have been determined to be too expensive. 
The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township in the 
interim. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 
Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
P.A. 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

On June 29, 2015, the City Council approved a substantial increase in water and sewer 
rates which will enable the city to provide funding for water and sewer operations. 

On July 6, 2015, Wade Trim took over the operation and maintenance of the water and 
sewer systems. 

Mr. Fouis Schimmel was hired on June 29, 2015, to provide consulting services 
regarding water and sewer issues. 

The city will issue an RFP in July to contract-out the collection of past due water and 
sewer bills from residential and commercial customers. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. A Wayne County Circuit Judge issued a 
temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water 
service to the city. The city was granted a stay on the $20M judgement levy on June 3, 
2015. 



Page 9 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council adopted a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under MDOT’s jurisdiction in the 
city. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a consultant’s recommendation for an amnesty 
plan for residential customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. The consultant 
has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, the city could 
collect S2.08M. The city has extended the amnesty plan until July 31, 2015. This will 
allow more time for customers to pay past due accounts. 

There are concerns about the city’s ability to successfully implement health insurance 
cost reductions as planned in FY 15. 

The city’s liabilities total $99. 9M. Some major components are: $55. 3M debt, including 
$20.7M owed to the DWSD, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits 
(OPEB). 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 
Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

On June 10, 2015 the county reached a settlement with retirees on healthcare. The 
county will no longer provide health insurance but will instead provide a stipend to 
retirees. This will result in a savings of $20M annually. 

On June 17, 2015 the Wayne County Executive requested a preliminary review under the 
Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, Public Act 436 of 2012. After notification to 
the county, the Department began its preliminary review of the County’s finances on 
June 19, 2015. A final preliminary review report was issued on June 30, 2015. 

On July 1, 2015 the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board met and found 
that probable financial stress exists in the county. 

On July 2, 2015, a five member review team was appointed. The review team met with 
various county officials, commissioners, personnel, and union representatives July 9 and 
10, 2015. A recommendation regarding the declaration of financial emergency will be 
forthcoming within seven to ten days. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The county’s annual structural General Fund deficit is approximately $52M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $53M in General Fund savings, 
$25M of which comes from changes to pension and healthcare benefits for active 
employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. The county has not yet proposed a long- 
term solution to its jail problems.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on 
November 1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid 
time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 
The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly 
advise the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The 
city paid the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical 
levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters.

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, 
and began on September 29, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 11, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four-month plan listing the priorities to 
be accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- $700K, and Culture and Recreation- S600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates 
remain conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will 
formally update revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year 
financial plan. 

As the city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in 
October 2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change 
orders. The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to the FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed 
session at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending 
contract. 



3 


Significant Action/Issues 

The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. 
The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 

The city’s four-year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the 
second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its 
base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 
17 - FY 20 budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the 
first budget since the EM’s departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and 
will be subject to FRC review and approval. 

At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the 
Michigan Financial Review Commission Act. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’s 
corporate city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 
2017. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under 
PA 72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM 
was operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 
claiming it was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the 
tests necessary to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position 
of City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1, 2015. $1 1.21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 



4 


in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the 
final copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has 
been trying to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these 
developments. 

The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1, 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four-year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs 
in Year 1. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court- 
ordered mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 
meeting. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

Fitigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion.

the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Fabor in 2014 of a wage claim 
filed with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. 
Department of Fabor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the 
settlement: 1) correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from 
the inception of the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission 



5 


approved the settlement at its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the 
settlement on August 11, 2015. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was 
inaccurate, according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and 
financial plan and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire 
service costs, which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. _ 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans.

the budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 

Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a 
previous 35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This 
injunction also requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water 
Fund, prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from 
disconnecting water service for nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction 
could potentially cost the General Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have 
not been successful. Most recently, Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a 
class action. 



6 


As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
S1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed 
an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal 
because the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back 
to Genesee County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is 
discussing the need for additional legal representation with the city. 

Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’s water system after a 
study by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard 
testing shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be 
adding a corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead 
leaching into the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality 
testing to residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case (Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 
0.6 mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation 
of the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the 
installation of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance 
with the federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to 
perform a leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is 
approximately 1/3 complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per 
year. 

On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department 
to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a 
hiring process.

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into 
sanitary sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 
15, 2015 and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 
2015 and will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review 
options for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial 
properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvements 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess

On July 6, 2016, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the 
lawsuit filed by the city against Ottawa Towers LLC / Phoenix Center. Treasury is 
working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator which could 
free up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



On August 19, 2015, the RTAB approved filling the positions of Customer Service 
Representative and Community Relations Specialist. These positions will assist the 
Mayor with community and economic development activities. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme 
Court. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On June 29, 2015, a tentative agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a 
judgment levy on the tax rolls. The levy would run for five years and repay the county 
$4.9M in past due sewer charges. The city is in discussions with Wayne County to 
postpone the levy until July 2016. 

On August 18, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled (Trahey v City of Inkster) that 
the trial court erred in determining the city’s 2012 water and sewer rates were 
unreasonable and ordering the city to issue $2.55M in credits to residents for reduced 
water and sewer rates. The city is evaluating this decision. 

The city is collaborating with MSHDA and MEDC to seek new housing developments 
and development of several vacant commercial parcels. Inkster Police and the city will

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on 
November 1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid 
time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 
The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly 
advise the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The 
city paid the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical 
levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters.

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, 
and began on September 29, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 11, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four-month plan listing the priorities to 
be accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- $700K, and Culture and Recreation- S600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates 
remain conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will 
formally update revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year 
financial plan. 

As the city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in 
October 2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change 
orders. The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to the FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed 
session at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending 
contract. 



3 


Significant Action/Issues 

The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. 
The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 

The city’s four-year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the 
second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its 
base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 
17 - FY 20 budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the 
first budget since the EM’s departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and 
will be subject to FRC review and approval. 

At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the 
Michigan Financial Review Commission Act. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’s 
corporate city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 
2017. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under 
PA 72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM 
was operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 
claiming it was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the 
tests necessary to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position 
of City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1, 2015. $1 1.21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 



4 


in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the 
final copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has 
been trying to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these 
developments. 

The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1, 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four-year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs 
in Year 1. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court- 
ordered mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 
meeting. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

Fitigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Farry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

Benton Harbor is hiring the MMF to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Fansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Fabor in 2014 of a wage claim 
filed with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. 
Department of Fabor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the 
settlement: 1) correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from 
the inception of the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission 



5 


approved the settlement at its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the 
settlement on August 11, 2015. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Eeorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was 
inaccurate, according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and 
financial plan and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire 
service costs, which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. _ 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 

Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a 
previous 35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This 
injunction also requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water 
Fund, prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from 
disconnecting water service for nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction 
could potentially cost the General Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have 
not been successful. Most recently, Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a 
class action. 



6 


As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
S1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed 
an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal 
because the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back 
to Genesee County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is 
discussing the need for additional legal representation with the city. 

Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’s water system after a 
study by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard 
testing shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be 
adding a corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead 
leaching into the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality 
testing to residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case (Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 
0.6 mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation 
of the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the 
installation of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance 
with the federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to 
perform a leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is 
approximately 1/3 complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per 
year. 

On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department 
to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a 
hiring process. 



7 


The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into 
sanitary sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 
15, 2015 and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 
2015 and will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review 
options for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial 
properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvements 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

On September 14, 2015, the City Council approved Jane Bais-DiSessa for the position of 
Deputy Mayor. The RTAB approved this appointment on September 16, 2015. 

On July 6, 2016, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the 
lawsuit filed by the city against Ottawa Towers LLC / Phoenix Center. Treasury is 
working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator which could 
free up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



On August 19, 2015, the RTAB approved filling the positions of Customer Service 
Representative and Community Relations Specialist. These positions will assist the 
Mayor with community and economic development activities. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme 
Court. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On June 29, 2015, a tentative agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a 
judgment levy on the tax rolls. The levy would run for five years and repay the county 
$4.9M in past due sewer charges. The city is in discussions with Wayne County to 
postpone the levy until July 2016. 

On August 18, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled (Trahey v City of Inkster) that 
the trial court erred in determining the city’s 2012 water and sewer rates were 
unreasonable and ordering the city to issue $2.55M in credits to residents for reduced 
water and sewer rates. The city is evaluating this decision. 

The city is collaborating with MSHDA and MEDC to seek new housing developments 
and development of several vacant commercial parcels. Inkster Police and the city will 
be utilizing an accumulation of training dollars to train police personnel and staff going 
forward. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved the FY 16 Budget. 

On August 3, 2015, the City Council voted to change the employment status of City 
Manager, Richard Marsh to Special Advisor to the city. The City Council named City 
Treasurer, Mark Stuhldreher to the position of Interim City Manager. A search firm will 
conduct a national search to fill the City Manager’s position. 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

On June 29, 2015, an Order was issued requiring the City Treasurer to approve all 
employment matters with city officials and employees, expenditure of funds, and all 
contracts.

reduction in healthcare costs. 

The city adopted its FY 16 Budget on May 19, 2015. The budget is balanced and has a 
beginning fund balance of $1,967,613. The city has prepared a proposed five-year budget 
that shows a deficit in FY 18 to FY 20 unless additional revenues can be found. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The Township Board voted to extend the Consent Agreement Consultant’s contract 
through March 31, 2016. 

The Consent Agreement Consultant, Treasury, and the Michigan State Police met with 
Oak Park City Manager on September 21, 2015 to discuss the city providing police 
services to the township. 

A six-month plan has been developed by Consent Agreement Consultant Robert Burgess, 
listing the priorities for the next several months. Treasury has been offering assistance to 
the consultant in implementing the plan’s priorities. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 4, 2015, voters approved a renewal of 4.5 mills for general operations. 

On June 17, 2015, an Order was issued granting the Consultant broad authority to 
approve expenditures made by the township and ensure that obligations are being paid. 
The Order also gives the Consultant authority to invest the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets with MERS. 

The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township. 

The township audit was completed. Auditors recommend the township submit a Deficit 
Elimination Plan for 2014, select a firm to advise the township on financial matters, and 
perform an inventory of assets. 



10 


Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 Budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. On May 20, 
2015, an Order was issued requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 
prior to authorization. 

Wayne County 

Recent 

On September 15, 2015, the County Deputy Chief Financial Officer submitted a cash 
flow forecast as required by the Consent Agreement. It is under review by Treasury 
staff. 

AFSCME Council 25 attempts to block any changes to the terms and conditions of 
employment has failed at the state courts. On September 15, 2015, AFSCME filed a 
Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent changes to the terms and 
conditions of employment in Federal Court but it has not yet been granted. The County 
has filed a request with the United States District Court to deny the Temporary 
Restraining Order and to dismiss the lawsuit. No decision has been made. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 21, 2015, the County Board approved the Consent Agreement negotiated 
between the County Executive and State Treasurer. 

On June 10, 2015, the county reached a settlement with retirees on healthcare. The 
county will no longer provide health insurance but will instead provide a stipend to 
retirees. This will result in a savings of $20M annually. 

The county’s annual structural General Fund deficit is approximately $52M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $53M in General Fund savings, 
$25M of which comes from changes to pension and healthcare benefits for active 
employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
P.A. 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

On August 11, 2015, a report was issued by Meadowbrook Insurance on the progress of 
reducing the city’s healthcare costs. When successfully implemented after October 1, 
2015, the $1.4M annual cost of healthcare could be reduced to $630K. 

On August 24, 2015, City Council gave conditional approval to the settlement agreement 
between the city and DWSD over past due water and sewer bills. However, the city is 
waiting for a response from DWSD on other issues. 

The second phase of emergency loans is under discussion. It would consist of 
approximately $4.7M to restructure the city’s three outstanding emergency loans and 
$11.5M to refinance outstanding debt. 



11 


The city has purchased the first quantity of water meters at a cost of $343K. Meter 
installation is underway. 

Wade Trim, the firm hired by Highland Park to manage the water and sewer operations, 
processed the first regular water and sewer bills to customers on August 13, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On June 29, 2015, City Council approved a substantial increase in water and sewer rates 
which will allow the city to fund water and sewer operations. 

On July 6, 2015, Wade Trim began duties to operate and maintain the water and sewer 
systems. 

Louis Schimmel was hired on June 29, 2015, to provide consulting services regarding 
water and sewer issues. 

On July 31, 2015, the water and sewer amnesty program expired. City Administrator 
Cathy Square stated the city will work with customers to settle their past due accounts. 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council approved a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under state jurisdiction in the city. 
The City Administrator has indicated that the city has filed suit against both MDOT and 
Wayne County over storm water. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a consultant’s recommendation for an amnesty 
plan for residential customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. The consultant 
has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, the city could 
collect $2.08M. The city extended the amnesty plan until July 31, 2015 to allow more 
time for customers to pay past due accounts. 

The city’s liabilities total $99. 9M. Some major components are: $55. 3M debt, including 
$20.7M owed to the DWSD, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits 
(OPEB).

NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

The Police and Fire Pension Board elected to switch investment advisors to PNC. EM 
Coulter now expects better returns on pension assets. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015 shows a further decline in pension 
funding, down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes are to be implemented on July 1, 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K annually. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 ended with a general fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. Salient 
increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal last month 
by a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is working to 
determine next steps. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 
Police CBAs must be finalized. 

Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 


FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC)

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the Financial Review 
Commission (FRC). The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements 
since its appointment in November 2014. 

At the May 18, 2015 FRC meeting, members approved various contracts and leases 
related to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department transaction. 

The most intense work the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restructuring initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

The next FRC meeting is scheduled for June 22, 2015. 

Significant Action/Issues 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The city met with the police bargaining unit and is considering a one-year extension to 
the CBA. Treasury is investigating whether existing EM Orders would prohibit changes 
until after the CBA expires June 30, 2015. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
Treasury is evaluating these projections. 

The city’s FY 16 budget was approved by City Council on May 26, 2015 and approved 
by the RTAB on June 3, 2015. Treasury is evaluating the budget. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury will participate in the selection 
process. 

Completion of the bond tender process, delayed due to uncertainty involving the City 
Administrator position, is projected for July 2015. 



Page 3 


Significant Actions/Issues 

- RTAB membership will need to be increased due to potential loss of one member and 
concern about possible deadlocked votes with the current four-member board. 

In April, the RTAB approved creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator position 
to oversee city operations until the bond tender and City Hall projects are complete. 
Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, was appointed to this 
position. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange has brought a Whistleblower 
and Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former 
Emergency Manager Tony Saunders. The case was originally scheduled to be heard July 
20, 2015, but is expected to be postponed due to a procedural appeal filed by the city. 

The city’s Finance Director has accepted a position as CFO in the City of Flint. Her last 
day in Benton Harbor was June 5, 2015. 

The city’s Deputy Finance Director, multiple Public Safety Officers, and two Public 
Works Department employees have resigned due to other employment opportunities. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

FY 14 audited general fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. To balance the budget, the city 
increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills to fund employee pensions. 
The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months), 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. The Mayor has 
submitted a letter of protest, disagreeing with this RTAB decision. 

The State Treasurer approved an RTAB recommendation to amend the final EM Order to 
provide RTAB oversight for all hiring and terminations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 4 


The RTAB’s Annual Evaluation for the Governor was not favorable, citing a lack of 
local financial literacy, political infighting, and an inability to develop a balanced multi- 
year budget. For these reasons, the removal of RTAB oversight cannot be recommended 
at this time. 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

Fegislation has been passed that will allow candidates who submitted petitions by April 
28, 2015 to have their names placed on the August Primary ballot. 

Jodi Fundquist has accepted the employment offer as CFO. 

As a result of a recent review, the Executive Director of the State Tax Commission 
notified the city that it must maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with 
statute and State Tax Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions 
necessary. In addition, the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame 
agreed upon with the State Tax Commission. The city will be issuing an RFP for a 
reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be 
completed in mid- July. 

On May 27, 2015, the city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak 
detection study. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense which would result and which would 
grow at a rate equal to the general rise in healthcare costs. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

Based on the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is $2.8M 
out of a total budget of $16. 2M. 



Page 5 


The city is undertaking a $7 million sewer infrastructure improvement project which is 
eligible for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow 
into the sanitary sewers. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the Emergency Manager’s two-year 
budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

On May 20, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. The amendment was adopted by City Council in April with no prior analysis 
or actuarial study being conducted. The best available estimates indicate an impact to the 
pension system of approximately $9-$13M per year. The ordinance amendment was sent 
back to committee for further review. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to file to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the GrayCo Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary private equity 
fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC proceedings, its effects 
on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with Gray’s firm. The Pension 
Board is reviewing options for withdrawal of pension assets from Grayson controlled 
funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 5, 2015, the city’s Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 55% to 45% 
margin. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

An Oakland Co. Circuit Judge dismissed the city’s condemnation lawsuit involving the 
Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for the lien placed on the 
property. The city is preparing an appeal to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’ s elimination of retiree healthcare and 



Page 6 


replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement will be placed on the tax roll by a 
judgement levy. 

Three Police Chief candidates were interviewed on June 1 1, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund accumulated deficit is $767K out of a total 
budget of $11M. 

The city owes $4.9M to Wayne County for sewer service. 

River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

The city adopted its FY 17 budget on May 19, 2015. The budget is balanced at 
$9,839,808 which compares with the FY 16 budget of $9,878,991. The city has prepared 
a proposed five-year budget that shows a deficit in FY 18 to FY 20 unless additional 
revenues can be found. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A fire union CBA was approved in March, resulting in a reduction in health care costs. 
General fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 14 and the accumulated 
fund balance was $1.9M. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

Treasury has learned that the Township Supervisor is regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime is not included in the FY 15 budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. An Order 
was issued May 20, 2015 requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 



Page 7 


prior to authorization. This is another example of the township’s inability to comply with 
the terms of the Consent Agreement. 

On April 7, 2015, Oakland County notified the township that they rejected the proposed 
ballot language for 4 Vi mills for general operations because the township’s proposed 
language did not conform to guidelines. The township adopted newly proposed ballot 
language on April 23, 2015 and the language was approved by Oakland County on May 
11,2015. 

A report issued by the Rehmann Group, the township’s financial consultant, noted that 
the township must make budget adjustments of $164,275 to its FY 15 general fund 
budget to account for expenditures exceeding revenues in FY 14. The township has 
adopted budget amendments with implementation pending. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City of Detroit has declined to provide police services to the township. This is being 
reviewed with the City of Detroit. Proposals from the cities of Ferndale and Hazel Park 
have been determined to be too expensive. The Michigan State Police continues to 
provide police services to the township in the interim. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
P.A. 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

Treasury staff is continuing to monitor the city’s lack of progress in complying with 
terms of a Loan Agreement dated September 23, 2014. There are concerns about the 
city’s ability to successfully restructure finances and implement health insurance benefit 
cost reductions as planned in FY 15. In addition, failure to reach an agreement with 
DWSD resulted in a $20M judgement levy against the city. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a financial consultant’s recommendation for an 
amnesty plan for residential water customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. 
The consultant has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, 
the city could collect $2.08M. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. A Wayne Co. Circuit Judge issued a 
temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water 
service to the city. The city was granted a stay on the $20M judgement levy on June 3, 
2015. 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council adopted a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under MDOT’s jurisdiction in the 
city. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Huron Consulting was retained to prepare a request for proposal to solicit firms to 
operate and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan of 
Adjustment. The city received one proposal from Wade Trim by the submission deadline 
of May 4, 2015. This proposal is under review by the city and Treasury. 



The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20.7M owed to the DWSD, $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. 


Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014: 

o The city must make major reductions to retiree healthcare benefit costs, 
o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $12M plus restructuring of $4.8M existing 
loans will be requested by the city to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization Bonds, 
$5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund Bonds. 
The status of this request will be reviewed in the context of benchmarks the city 
committed to in their last emergency loan in September 2014. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

The Recovery Plan has been released to the public and Treasury has begun an analysis. 

On June 10, 2015, the county announced a settlement with retirees over health care 
benefits that is expected to save $20K annually. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Cash reserves reached its lowest point in February 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $22M. The August 2014 cash balance was approximately $150M. This 
includes proceeds from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

The county’s annual structural general fund deficit is approximately $50M prior to any of 
the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $50M. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures (participants are paying a larger share). This does not include any saving 
opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 

The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

Fegislation has been passed that will allow candidates who submitted petitions by April 
28, 2015 to have their names placed on the August Primary ballot. 

Jodi Fundquist has accepted the employment offer as CFO. 

As a result of a recent review, the Executive Director of the State Tax Commission 
notified the city that it must maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with 
statute and State Tax Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions 
necessary. In addition, the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame 
agreed upon with the State Tax Commission. The city will be issuing an RFP for a 
reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be 
completed in mid- July. 

On May 27, 2015, the city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak 
detection study. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense which would result and which would 
grow at a rate equal to the general rise in healthcare costs. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

Based on the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is $2.8M 
out of a total budget of $16. 2M.

The city is undertaking a $7 million sewer infrastructure improvement project which is 
eligible for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow 
into the sanitary sewers. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the Emergency Manager’s two-year 
budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

On May 20, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. The amendment was adopted by City Council in April with no prior analysis 
or actuarial study being conducted. The best available estimates indicate an impact to the 
pension system of approximately $9-$13M per year. The ordinance amendment was sent 
back to committee for further review. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to file to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the GrayCo Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary private equity 
fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC proceedings, its effects 
on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with Gray’s firm. The Pension 
Board is reviewing options for withdrawal of pension assets from Grayson controlled 
funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 5, 2015, the city’s Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 55% to 45% 
margin. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

An Oakland Co. Circuit Judge dismissed the city’s condemnation lawsuit involving the 
Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for the lien placed on the 
property. The city is preparing an appeal to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’ s elimination of retiree healthcare and 



Page 6 


replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement will be placed on the tax roll by a 
judgement levy. 

Three Police Chief candidates were interviewed on June 1 1, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund accumulated deficit is $767K out of a total 
budget of $11M. 

The city owes $4.9M to Wayne County for sewer service. 

River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

The city adopted its FY 17 budget on May 19, 2015. The budget is balanced at 
$9,839,808 which compares with the FY 16 budget of $9,878,991. The city has prepared 
a proposed five-year budget that shows a deficit in FY 18 to FY 20 unless additional 
revenues can be found. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A fire union CBA was approved in March, resulting in a reduction in health care costs. 
General fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 14 and the accumulated 
fund balance was $1.9M. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

Treasury has learned that the Township Supervisor is regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime is not included in the FY 15 budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. An Order 
was issued May 20, 2015 requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 



Page 7 


prior to authorization. This is another example of the township’s inability to comply with 
the terms of the Consent Agreement. 

On April 7, 2015, Oakland County notified the township that they rejected the proposed 
ballot language for 4 Vi mills for general operations because the township’s proposed 
language did not conform to guidelines. The township adopted newly proposed ballot 
language on April 23, 2015 and the language was approved by Oakland County on May 
11,2015. 

A report issued by the Rehmann Group, the township’s financial consultant, noted that 
the township must make budget adjustments of $164,275 to its FY 15 general fund 
budget to account for expenditures exceeding revenues in FY 14. The township has 
adopted budget amendments with implementation pending. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City of Detroit has declined to provide police services to the township. This is being 
reviewed with the City of Detroit. Proposals from the cities of Ferndale and Hazel Park 
have been determined to be too expensive. The Michigan State Police continues to 
provide police services to the township in the interim. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
P.A. 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

Treasury staff is continuing to monitor the city’s lack of progress in complying with 
terms of a Loan Agreement dated September 23, 2014. There are concerns about the 
city’s ability to successfully restructure finances and implement health insurance benefit 
cost reductions as planned in FY 15. In addition, failure to reach an agreement with 
DWSD resulted in a $20M judgement levy against the city. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a financial consultant’s recommendation for an 
amnesty plan for residential water customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. 
The consultant has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, 
the city could collect $2.08M. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. A Wayne Co. Circuit Judge issued a 
temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water 
service to the city. The city was granted a stay on the $20M judgement levy on June 3, 
2015. 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council adopted a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under MDOT’s jurisdiction in the 
city. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Huron Consulting was retained to prepare a request for proposal to solicit firms to 
operate and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan of 
Adjustment. The city received one proposal from Wade Trim by the submission deadline 
of May 4, 2015. This proposal is under review by the city and Treasury. 



The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20.7M owed to the DWSD, $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. 


Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014: 

o The city must make major reductions to retiree healthcare benefit costs, 
o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $12M plus restructuring of $4.8M existing 
loans will be requested by the city to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization Bonds, 
$5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund Bonds. 
The status of this request will be reviewed in the context of benchmarks the city 
committed to in their last emergency loan in September 2014. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

The Recovery Plan has been released to the public and Treasury has begun an analysis. 

On June 10, 2015, the county announced a settlement with retirees over health care 
benefits that is expected to save $20K annually. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Cash reserves reached its lowest point in February 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $22M. The August 2014 cash balance was approximately $150M. This 
includes proceeds from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

The county’s annual structural general fund deficit is approximately $50M prior to any of 
the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $50M. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures (participants are paying a larger share). This does not include any saving 
opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 

The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on 
November 1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid 
time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 
The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly 
advise the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The 
city paid the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical 
levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters.

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, 
and began on September 29, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 11, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four-month plan listing the priorities to 
be accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- $700K, and Culture and Recreation- S600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates 
remain conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will 
formally update revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year 
financial plan. 

As the city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in 
October 2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change 
orders. The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to the FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed 
session at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending 
contract. 



3 


Significant Action/Issues 

The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. 
The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 

The city’s four-year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the 
second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its 
base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 
17 - FY 20 budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the 
first budget since the EM’s departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and 
will be subject to FRC review and approval. 

At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the 
Michigan Financial Review Commission Act. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’s 
corporate city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 
2017. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under 
PA 72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM 
was operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 
claiming it was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the 
tests necessary to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position 
of City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1, 2015. $1 1.21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 



4 


in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the 
final copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has 
been trying to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these 
developments. 

The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1, 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four-year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs 
in Year 1. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court- 
ordered mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 
meeting. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

Fitigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Farry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

Benton Harbor is hiring the MMF to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Fansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Fabor in 2014 of a wage claim 
filed with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. 
Department of Fabor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the 
settlement: 1) correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from 
the inception of the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission 



5 


approved the settlement at its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the 
settlement on August 11, 2015. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Eeorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was 
inaccurate, according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and 
financial plan and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire 
service costs, which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. _ 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 

Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a 
previous 35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This 
injunction also requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water 
Fund, prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from 
disconnecting water service for nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction 
could potentially cost the General Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have 
not been successful. Most recently, Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a 
class action. 



6 


As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
S1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed 
an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal 
because the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back 
to Genesee County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is 
discussing the need for additional legal representation with the city. 

Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’s water system after a 
study by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard 
testing shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be 
adding a corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead 
leaching into the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality 
testing to residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case (Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 
0.6 mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation 
of the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the 
installation of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance 
with the federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to 
perform a leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is 
approximately 1/3 complete.

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into 
sanitary sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 
15, 2015 and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 
2015 and will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review 
options for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial

plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget.

$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme 
Court. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker.

Subject: Mattawan Wetland Dump 


Dear Mr. Wyant, 

The series of emails you received from me over the last few weeks hopefully explains our situation compared to Flint 
regarding the similarities as to how water complaints are handled in Michigan. In both situations, the agency used 
tactics designed to bully the complainants and attempt to downplay the potential for hazardous pollutants. My intent is 
to make you fully aware of the ineffectual culture of the MDEQ, from my perspective. 

The emails below were sent to Fred Sellers and other MDEQ agents at the Kalamzoo district office during our three year 
ordeal. They depict our concerns and frustration as to how the wetland dump complaints were handled. Enclosed as an 
attachment to this email is a video taken of a suspected hazardous waste pile being removed from site. I mentioned this 
video in my last correspondence to you. It was sped up for brevity. This particular pile was hastily taken off-site while the 
remaining waste stayed in place for months after. For clarity, during the evacuation of waste from the wetland dump 
location, the owner would take select items and place them in the pile at the rear of his property then use his tractor to 
cover with dirt. While it was happening, I asked the MDEQ to come out and investigate and was ignored. Then at a later 


l 







date, I witnessed a crew of three hastily removing the pile. I immediately contacted the MDEQ and asked for a field 
agent to come out and investigate before the pile was removed and again was ignored. 

Completely frustrated, I complained to Sellers about being ignored and explained to him that they missed an 
opportunity to validate that hazardous waste was indeed disposed in the dump. (Keep in mind this was after being 
ignored about the fuel spills.) He justified his fumbling by telling me I should consider the hazardous waste removal as a 
victory. I told Sellers removing the waste off-site was not the issue; I further stated that if they would have investigated 
both the fuel spills and the hazardous waste pile then it would have helped to validate what was actually in the dump 
and provide additional data that would assist with the soil sampling strategy. But as I said from the beginning of this 
email series Sellers did not want to find contaminants. 

Again Mr. Wyant, what ties our issue to the Flint situation is the arrogance of the MDEQ when dealing with legitimate 
complaints from the public. The subterfuge employed by MDEQ staff is appalling and the lengths they will go to cover 
that subterfuge does not bode well for your agency. 

The last video I sent a few days ago showed the so-called soil sampling from the evacuated waste piles - light versus 
dark soils. In the next few days I'll send a video showing the actual sampling of the wetland dump site.

Fred, 

This is in response to the email below: 

How are you defining progress from Mr. Rininger? In the past 20 months he removed 6 barrels off site - according to 
video about 1 hour of work. Next, he cleaned up what we believe to be an area of hazardous waste. Again, based on 
video, approximately 6 hours of work. This is not progress Fred this is him dragging his feet. So essentially, we have less 
than one 8 hour day of work in 20 months - this is progress? 

Next, let's look at a few pictures for comparison purposes. You stated that Katie did not see evidence of hazardous 
waste based on dirt erosion of the west sides of the multiple piles. The enclosed picture from Aug 2013 shows the piles 
at their origin. The second group of pictures, titled 9May2014, show these same piles. Except for the fact that green 
vegetation has now grown from the piles they look pretty much the same. Are you insinuating that you're comfortable 
that there is nothing in these piles of waste that would be considered hazardous based on Katie just walking by and 
taking a few frames of video? Can you see dioxin and toxic metals from that vantage point? Fred, don't you remember 
seeing the video of the truckload of ash being dumped (enclosed) into the wetland from his 8 x 8 foot 
incinerator. What about the treated lumber you found stacked outside the incinerator and the bag of garbage inside? 
Do you know how many years he has been dumping this ash from his hobby farm in the wetland which is now sitting in 
piles above our water aquifer? Are you telling me that this small subset of waste (as you put it) is not polluted from 
years of toxic ash and that the soil can now simply be spread along our aquifer? 


2 



Let's also separate out the blight from the solid waste that came from the dump. Yes, the blight is a nuisance but our 
main concern is the piles of waste that was removed from the wetland and is now sitting above our water aquifer for the 
past 20 months and percolating leachate. I would also like to ask why do you keep telling me that household waste is 
not regulated? Fred, read your own letter you sent last August to the owner, he admitted to allowing multiple entities 
access to the unpermitted and unsupervised wetland dumpsite. Again, this is not normal household trash from one 
household, but waste from the community, apartments, and possibly a business based on the ionized water found. 

I'm going to ask you again, do you actually believe that for 15 (correction 20 years) plus years of unsupervised dumping 
in a unpermitted landfill back in the woods, out of site, that people or businesses who used that site did not dump 
hazardous waste of some sort? Starting from the first time we talked, I have just about begged you to do soil samples. 
Finally, this past month you agreed but here we sit and still no samples. It's as if you're trying to buy additional time to 
allow dilution - why? When you first identified the barrels of liquid, you told me that the owner would have to have 
them tested. I then questioned why after identifying the potential hazardous waste would you not ensure a chain of 
custody to safeguard the barrels from tampering? After a few go-arounds on this topic you finally agreed to use 
evidence tape. This was elementary to me but it was like you just didn't care. 

I sent you a video of him removing a battery from the suspected hazardous waste pile off-site. The video was not 
intended for the battery to be a sole piece of evidence, but to validate what we told the agency from the very first day 
he began removing the waste from the wetland, that he had a special pile in the back where he periodically placed items 
from the original dump site then covered with dirt. I sent this information in an email and talked to you and Katie on the 
phone about it, but you refused to come out and investigate. But after he removed the pile a few weeks ago you then 
sent Katie out to investigate the site? Why did you wait until the suspected hazardous waste was removed before 
investigating? And why after I asked if you viewed the video of the battery being taken off-site did you completely 
downplay its importance to validating the hazardous waste pile ? You're exact words were, “you should consider this a 
victory." When I reported the fuel spill no one came out to investigate - why? In regard to your comment about 
licensed landfills inspecting the waste brought to the site, I can tell you emphatically that there have been multiple times 
where I brought trailers full of waste and no inspection took place. So I don't have much faith in that process being a 
discriminator for hazardous waste. 

When I informed the agency during the evacuation that he was dumping the wetland contents on our property-line, 
above our aquifer, notwithstanding the guidance from Derek that the solid waste had to be moved to a licensed 
landfill, yet no one came out to tell him to stop. The agency knew he was not following its guidance but did nothing. The 
evacuation continued for two additional months. We had to sit here day after day and watch tons of solid waste being 
dumped on our property-line above our water aquifer because no one in that two month time period would come out 
and tell him to stop. Basically, the agency knew first-hand that he was creating another violation but did absolutely 
nothing to stop him. All it would have taken is for someone to come out and tell him to cease! 

I said this multiple times and I'll say it again Fred your obvious main objective in this ordeal is strictly about minimizing 
the agency's responsibility. You have told me countless times that you are understaffed and have no money for cleaning 
up the sites. You absolutely refused to have the criminal investigation unit involved even after the owner disregarded 
the agency's directives and missed four clean-up deadlines. You even went as far to tell me that this seemed to be a 
neighborly dispute and we were partially responsible. I don't know if you said this out of frustration or you had some 
other purpose in mind, but we sure didn't appreciate the comment. It's analogous to firing the whistle blower. With 
respect to taking money from the agency's budget to properly address the violations, this should not be a tax payer 
expense, the owner of the property knew that he was creating another violation but disregarded the agency's 
directives. 

Since I have been exposing all these concerns your subsequent emails have been written in a way to attempt damage 
control or make it sound like you're on top of this issue and have done nothing wrong. I have kept every email, letter, 
photo, video, and records of our phone conversations. I can build a time-line countering all the nonsense you have been 
recently spieling out. Fred, I absolutely don't feel confident at this point that you have our best interests in mind. I'm

again asking for complete removal of the contaminated waste that came from the wetland site within 30 days. I'm also 
requesting a criminal investigation to ensure we take the politics and your personal bias out of the equation. 



Ash from garbage and treated lumber (EPA) 

Backyard burning also produces ash residue, which can contain toxic metals such as mercury, lead, chromium, and 
arsenic. These metals can be toxic when ingested. When a person ingests hazardous amounts of lead, for example, he 
or she may experience high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems, kidney damage, and brain damage. Unaware of 
the potential danger, some people scatter the ash in their gardens or bury it on their property. Garden vegetables can 
absorb and accumulate these metals, which can make them dangerous to eat. Children playing in the yard or garden 
can incidentally ingest soil containing these metals. Also, rain can wash the ash into groundwater and surface water, 
contaminating drinking water and food. 

The wood ash that remains from the burning of pressure treated wood is a very real and toxic problem. This ash 
contains 80% of the toxins that were contained in the wood. This ash is highly " leachable" and can contaminate ground 
water if buried. 

Fred, (May 1, 2014) 

Enclosed in a second email is a video of Mr. Rininger sifting through a mound of waste toward the back of his property 
selectively removing items from the pile. Then he moves two loads off site. There is definitely an effort here to hastily 
remove the items. Basically, he sifts through piles collects what he's looking for then departs. This has been the extent 
of his clean-up in over a year. 

On Aug 4, 2013 I reported in an email (below) to the agency what was happening, that he had a few special piles in the 
back where he seemed to be periodically placing items then covering with dirt but no one followed up. I talked to both 
you and Katie about this also. How can we be assured that further pollution isn't adversely affecting the aquifer if no one 
inspects what's internal in these mounds of solid waste? Again, we're talking about 10+ years (correction 20 years) of 
unsupervised dumping by multiple entities. 

Also in the June 19 email below, Derek indicates that Mr. Rininger is aware of the differences in waste and indicates that 
he'll have the site cleaned up in July. In a few months we'll be at two years. 


Hi Katie, (May 12, 2014) 

For what it's worth enclosed is a video of Mr. Rininger and a few other workers removing what I believe to be hazardous 
waste. As I informed the MDEQ on multiple occasions during the evacuation of the wetland, he periodically would store 
certain items in this pile then cover with dirt. Last week he hurriedly removed those items and took them off site. This 
is the only material that has been removed, nothing else has been accomplished. The video's speed has been increased 
to give you the gist of what transpired. I understand that because he was not required to spread the piles or no one 
came out and watched the evacuation this doesn't amount to much with respect to any kind of enforcement. That said, 
it does greatly concern us because our water aquifer is immediately under the solid waste. I have a few questions: 

1. Has the department considered involving a toxicologist from the health department to determine if a public 
health hazard exists with respect to the waste now stored on our property-line and the fact that he dumped 
years of ash from burning illegal substances in the 8x8 foot incinerator which is now mixed in with the soil 
removed from the wetland and other waste. 

2. Can you please give me an update on what the department is now doing since he is no longer making progress 
with removing the solid waste? 

3. Have you been communicating with the township? If so please update me on their progress. 

Thank you Katie,

Hello Derek, (Aug 4, 2013) 


As you can see from the pictures this is getting way out-of-hand. There are numerous piles of solid waste and fuel oil 
odor. I watched him try to hide some of the waste in the woods and seen him burying piles of whatever with dirt in the 
back piles. Again, I ask that someone come out this week to get this under control. Keep in mind this is over 10 years of 
waste - (correction 20years) from a number of families. 


Respectfully, 



Hello Katie, (September 17, 2013) 

Enclosed are some pictures I took today of empty barrels that just showed up. (see picture of same location taken in 
August - no barrels) These were hidden from view before they ended up here. Do you have any idea what was in these 
barrels before emptied? Did Mr. Rininger inform you that he was going to empty the barrels? Also, I assume Mr. Riniger 
is going to be required to flatten out all these hills of solid waste so a complete inspection can be 
conducted, right? How else will we know what is buried in these piles? Did you and Fred agree on a date yet for a visit? 

Thx

Dear Mr. Wyant, 


The series of emails you received from me over the last few weeks hopefully explains our situation compared to Flint 
regarding the similarities as to how water complaints are handled in Michigan. In both situations, the agency used 
tactics designed to bully the complainants and attempt to downplay the potential for hazardous pollutants. My intent is 
to make you fully aware of the ineffectual culture of the MDEQ, from my perspective. 


The emails below were sent to Fred Sellers and other MDEQ agents at the Kalamzoo district office during our three year 
ordeal. They depict our concerns and frustration as to how the wetland dump complaints were handled. Enclosed as an 
attachment to this email is a video taken of a suspected hazardous waste pile being removed from site. I mentioned this 
video in my last correspondence to you. It was sped up for brevity. This particular pile was hastily taken off-site while the 
remaining waste stayed in place for months after. For clarity, during the evacuation of waste from the wetland dump 
location, the owner would take select items and place them in the pile at the rear of his property then use his tractor to 
cover with dirt. While it was happening, I asked the MDEQ to come out and investigate and was ignored. Then at a later 
date, I witnessed a crew of three hastily removing the pile. I immediately contacted the MDEQ and asked for a field 
agent to come out and investigate before the pile was removed and again was ignored. 


Completely frustrated, I complained to Sellers about being ignored and explained to him that they missed an 
opportunity to validate that hazardous waste was indeed disposed in the dump. (Keep in mind this was after being 









ignored about the fuel spills.) He justified his fumbling by telling me I should consider the hazardous waste removal as a 
victory. I told Sellers removing the waste off-site was not the issue; I further stated that if they would have investigated 
both the fuel spills and the hazardous waste pile then it would have helped to validate what was actually in the dump 
and provide additional data that would assist with the soil sampling strategy. But as I said from the beginning of this 
email series Sellers did not want to find contaminants. 


Again Mr. Wyant, what ties our issue to the Flint situation is the arrogance of the MDEQ when dealing with legitimate 
complaints from the public. The subterfuge employed by MDEQ staff is appalling and the lengths they will go to cover 
that subterfuge does not bode well for your agency. 


The last video I sent a few days ago showed the so-called soil sampling from the evacuated waste piles - light versus 
dark soils. In the next few days I'll send a video showing the actual sampling of the wetland dump site. 


Respectfully,

Subject: FW: dumping complaint 


Fred, 


This is in response to the email below: 




How are you defining progress from Mr. Rininger? In the past 20 months he removed 6 barrels off site - according to 
video about 1 hour of work. Next,, he cleaned up what we believe to be an area of hazardous waste. Again, based on 
video, approximately 6 hours of work. This is not progress Fred this is him dragging his feet. So essentially, we have less 
than one 8 hour day of work in 20 months - this is progress? 


Next, let's look at a few pictures for comparison purposes. You stated that Katie did not see evidence of hazardous 
waste based on dirt erosion of the west sides of the multiple piles. The enclosed picture from Aug 2013 shows the piles 
at their origin. The second group of pictures, titled 9May2014, show these same piles. Except for the fact that green 
vegetation has now grown from the piles they look pretty much the same. Are you insinuating that you're comfortable 
that there is nothing in these piles of waste that would be considered hazardous based on Katie just walking by and 
taking a few frames of video? Can you see dioxin and toxic metals from that vantage point? Fred, don't you remember 
seeing the video of the truckload of ash being dumped (enclosed) into the wetland from his 8 x 8 foot 
incinerator. What about the treated lumber you found stacked outside the incinerator and the bag of garbage inside? 
Do you know how many years he has been dumping this ash from his hobby farm in the wetland which is now sitting in 
piles above our water aquifer? Are you telling me that this small subset of waste (as you put it) is not polluted from 
years of toxic ash and that the soil can now simply be spread along our aquifer? 


Let's also separate out the blight from the solid waste that came from the dump. Yes, the blight is a nuisance but our 
main concern is the piles of waste that was removed from the wetland and is now sitting above our water aquifer for the 
past 20 months and percolating leachate. I would also like to ask why do you keep telling me that household waste is 
not regulated? Fred, read your own letter you sent last August to the owner, he admitted to allowing multiple entities 
access to the unpermitted and unsupervised wetland dumpsite. Again, this is not normal household trash from one 
household, but waste from the community, apartments, and possibly a business based on the ionized water found. 


I'm going to ask you again, do you actually believe that for 15 (correction 20 years) plus years of unsupervised dumping 
in a unpermitted landfill back in the woods, out of site, that people or businesses who used that site did not dump 
hazardous waste of some sort? Starting from the first time we talked, I have just about begged you to do soil samples. 
Finally, this past month you agreed but here we sit and still no samples. It's as if you're trying to buy additional time to 
allow dilution - why? When you first identified the barrels of liquid, you told me that the owner would have to have 
them tested. I then questioned why after identifying the potential hazardous waste would you not ensure a chain of 
custody to safeguard the barrels from tampering? After a few go-arounds on this topic you finally agreed to use 
evidence tape. This was elementary to me but it was like you just didn't care. 


I sent you a video of him removing a battery from the suspected hazardous waste pile off-site. The video was not 
intended for the battery to be a sole piece of evidence, but to validate what we told the agency from the very first day 
he began removing the waste from the wetland, that he had a special pile in the back where he periodically placed items 
from the original dump site then covered with dirt. I sent this information in an email and talked to you and Katie on the 
phone about it, but you refused to come out and investigate. But after he removed the pile a few weeks ago you then 
sent Katie out to investigate the site? Why did you wait until the suspected hazardous waste was removed before 



investigating? And why after I asked if you viewed the video of the battery being taken off-site did you completely 
downplay its importance to validating the hazardous waste pile ? You're exact words were, "you should consider this a 
victory." When I reported the fuel spill no one came out to investigate - why? In regard to your comment about 
licensed landfills inspecting the waste brought to the site, I can tell you emphatically that there have been multiple times 
where I brought trailers full of waste and no inspection took place. So I don't have much faith in that process being a 
discriminator for hazardous waste. 


When I informed the agency during the evacuation that he was dumping the wetland contents on our property-line, 
above our aquifer, notwithstanding the guidance from Derek that the solid waste had to be moved to a licensed 
landfill, yet no one came out to tell him to stop. The agency knew he was not following its guidance but did nothing. The 
evacuation continued for two additional months. We had to sit here day after day and watch tons of solid waste being 
dumped on our property-line above our water aquifer because no one in that two month time period would come out 
and tell him to stop. Basically, the agency knew first-hand that he was creating another violation but did absolutely 
nothing to stop him. All it would have taken is for someone to come out and tell him to cease! 


I said this multiple times and I'll say it again Fred your obvious main objective in this ordeal is strictly about minimizing 
the agency's responsibility. You have told me countless times that you are understaffed and have no money for cleaning 
up the sites. You absolutely refused to have the criminal investigation unit involved even after the owner disregarded 
the agency's directives and missed four clean-up deadlines. You even went as far to tell me that this seemed to be a 
neighborly dispute and we were partially responsible. I don't know if you said this out of frustration or you had some 
other purpose in mind, but we sure didn't appreciate the comment. It's analogous to firing the whistle blower. With 
respect to taking money from the agency's budget to properly address the violations, this should not be a tax payer 
expense, the owner of the property knew that he was creating another violation but disregarded the agency's 
directives. 


Since I have been exposing all these concerns your subsequent emails have been written in a way to attempt damage 
control or make it sound like you're on top of this issue and have done nothing wrong, i have kept every email, letter, 
photo, video, and records of our phone conversations. I can build a time-line countering all the nonsense you have been 
recently spieling out. Fred, I absolutely don't feel confident at this point that you have our best interests in mind. I'm 
again asking for complete removal of the contaminated waste that came from the wetland site within 30 days. I'm also 
requesting a criminal investigation to ensure we take the politics and your personal bias out of the equation. 



Ash from garbage and treated lumber (EPA) 



Backyard burning also produces ash residue, which can contain toxic metals such as mercury, lead, chromium, and 
arsenic. These metals can be toxic when ingested. When a person ingests hazardous amounts of lead, for example, he 
or she may experience high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems, kidney damage, and brain damage. Unaware of 
the potential danger, some people scatter the ash in their gardens or bury it on their property. Garden vegetables can 
absorb and accumulate these metals, which can make them dangerous to eat. Children playing in the yard or garden 
can incidentally ingest soil containing these metals. Also, rain can wash the ash into groundwater and surface water, 
contaminating drinking water and food. 


The wood ash that remains from the burning of pressure treated wood is a very real and toxic problem. This ash 
contains 80% of the toxins that were contained in the wood. This ash is highly " leachable" and can contaminate ground 
water if buried. 


Fred, (May 1, 2014) 


Enclosed in a second email is a video of Mr. Rininger sifting through a mound of waste toward the back of his property 
selectively removing items from the pile. Then he moves two loads off site. There is definitely an effort here to hastily 
remove the items. Basically, he sifts through piles collects what he's looking for then departs. This has been the extent 
of his clean-up in over a year. 


On Aug 4, 2013 I reported in an email (below) to the agency what was happening, that he had a few special piles in the 
back where he seemed to be periodically placing items then covering with dirt but no one followed up. I talked to both 
you and Katie about this also. How can we be assured that further pollution isn't adversely affecting the aquifer if no one 
inspects what's internal in these mounds of solid waste? Again, we're talking about 10+ years (correction 20 years) of 
unsupervised dumping by multiple entities. 


Also in the June 19 email below, Derek indicates that Mr. Rininger is aware of the differences in waste and indicates that 
he'll have the site cleaned up in July. In a few months we'll be at two years. 


Hi Katie, (May 12, 2014) 


For what it's worth enclosed is a video of Mr. Rininger and a few other workers removing what I believe to be hazardous 
waste. As I informed the MDEQ on multiple occasions during the evacuation of the wetland, he periodically would store 
certain items in this pile then cover with dirt. Last week he hurriedly removed those items and took them off site. This 
is the only material that has been removed, nothing else has been accomplished. The video's speed has been increased 
to give you the gist of what transpired. I understand that because he was not required to spread the piles or no one 



came out and watched the evacuation this doesn't amount to much with respect to any kind of enforcement. That said, 
it does greatly concern us because our water aquifer is immediately under the solid waste. I have a few questions: 


1. Has the department considered involving a toxicologist from the health department to determine if a public 
health hazard exists with respect to the waste now stored on our property-line and the fact that he dumped 
years of ash from burning illegal substances in the 8x8 foot incinerator which is now mixed in with the soil 
removed from the wetland and other waste. 

2. Can you please give me an update on what the department is now doing since he is no longer making progress 
with removing the solid waste? 

3. Have you been communicating with the township? If so please update me on their progress. 


Thank you Katie, 



Hello Derek, (Aug 4, 2013) 


As you can see from the pictures this is getting way out-of-hand. There are numerous piles of solid waste and fuel oil 
odor. I watched him try to hide some of the waste in the woods and seen him burying piles of whatever with dirt in the 
back piles. Again, I ask that someone come out this week to get this under control. Keep in mind this is over 10 years of 
waste - (correction ZOyears) from a number of families. 


Respectfully, 



Hello Katie, (September 17, 2013) 





Enclosed are some pictures I took today of empty barrels that just showed up, (see picture of same location taken in 
August - no barrels) These were hidden from view before they ended up here. Do you have any idea what was in these 
barrels before emptied? Did Mr. Rininger inform you that he was going to empty the barrels? Also, I assume Mr. Riniger 
is going to be required to flatten out all these hills of solid waste so a complete inspection can be 
conducted, right? How else will we know what is buried in these piles? Did you and Fred agree on a date yet for a visit? 


Thx

prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from disconnecting water 
service for nonpayment The city's appellate efforts to date have not been successful The 
city has requested financial assistance related to the litigation regarding water issues. 

* Kincaid vs. City of Flint litigation was held that the EM had no statutory authority to later; 
ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed an appeal to the; 
Michigan Supreme Court, but the Court did not address the appeal because the city missed; 
the filing deadline by one day. The ease has been remanded back to Genesee County Circuit

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 28-29, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted the formal 
plumbing evaluation of Flint Community Schools’ Northwestern High School and 
Southwestern Classical Academy. On December 29-30 staff from DEQ and DLARA 
then performed the follow-up sampling of the drinking fountains and faucets that are 
used for consumptive purposes at these two facilities. This completes the initial 
evaluation process for all 13 schools of the Flint Community Schools. Once the Flint 
Community Schools has had an opportunity to incorporate the recommendations in the 
plumbing evaluation reports, a follow-up sampling will be scheduled to ensure that all of 
the issues have been properly addressed. 

Evaluations of the Flint Community Schools will continue to be posted to the Flint water 
Web site: www.mi.gQv/fjintwater . These reports are being shared with Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab first and then posted. So far, three reports have 
been posted, with the remaining reports expected to be completed by the end of 
January 2016. 

A list of schools and childcare facilities served by the Flint water system requesting a 
plumbing evaluation has been created. These facilities will be contacted during the first 
two weeks in January to schedule a free plumbing evaluation of their facilities. The 
protocol used will be the same one used for the Flint Community Schools. To date, 
there are a total of 10 facilities that have requested a plumbing evaluation. Once these 
10 facilities have been scheduled, efforts will be made to reach out to additional facilities 
that may wish to take advantage of this free program. 

Video footage was taken on December 29, 2015, of the plumbing evaluation process 
and the sampling protocol of the drinking fountains and faucets at Flint Community 
Schools’ Northwestern High School and Southwestern Classical Academy. This 
footage is being used to create a video that provides an easy-to-understand explanation 
of how the plumbing evaluations and subsequent sampling is being done in the schools. 
The target audience for this video is primarily the residents of Flint so that they can get 
a visual of the efforts already underway, but it is anticipated that this video will also be 
used as an instructional aid for schools elsewhere in Michigan that are interested in 
having their facilities evaluated. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report. 

Concerns: 


There are no new concerns to report. 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update

Significant Event : 

On December 29, 2015, Dan Wyant resigned his position as Director of the DEQ. DNR 
Director Keith Creagh has been appointed Interim Director of the DEQ. Reports have 
been created and meetings have been scheduled to provide Director Creagh with a 
history of the Flint situation as well as current plans for moving forward. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• The Flint water Web site has been redesigned. The old site was beginning to 
become cluttered and information was becoming difficult to locate. The new 
design provides a more user friendly interface and has a more elegant flow. It is 
anticipated that the redesigned Web site will go live during the week of January 4, 
2016. 

• The DEQ Laboratory identified a lead result as being alarmingly high. This result 
was conveyed to Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian so that the 
customer could be contacted instead of waiting for the final report to go out. 
Investigation of the address revealed that the sample was taken at the Whaley 
Children’s Center. The facility was contacted, and the contact there was notified 
that one of the samples that they submitted was in excess of 2,500 parts per 
billion (ppb), or more than 160 times higher than the federally-mandated action 
level of 1 5 ppb. The contact was instructed to take measures to ensure that 
water from that point was not being used for consumptive purposes. Since the 
facility provided childcare, Mr. Krisztian described the free plumbing evaluation 
service available and offered to put Whaley Children’s Center on the list of 
facilities being evaluated. The contact indicated that they would provide the 
information to management for consideration. 

• A review of the results from the free lead testing offered to all Flint residents 
since November 1 , 2015, show a downward trend compared to results from 
those prior to November 1 , 201 5. This can be attributed to a number of factors. 
The switch to using water from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, the 
implementation of supplemental phosphate addition, and the colder temperatures 
are all possible contributing factors in this trend. 

Since November 1 , 201 5, a total of 298 samples have been submitted and 
analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory. Of these samples, 248 or 83.2% show 
concentrations of 5 ppb or less. In addition, 279 samples or 93.6% show 
concentrations at or below the action level of 15 ppb. 

While this data is encouraging and indicates that the Flint water supply is moving 
towards compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), it is imperative to 
view this data cautiously. The LCR specifies what sampling points may be used 
for compliance purposes. The data for these samples is nonselective and 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 3 


potentially may not be coming from distribution points that would be allowed 
under the LCR. In addition, although the paperwork indicates that samples 
should not go through a filter, it is possible that some residents are using the free 
lead testing service to ensure the filters that have been provided do, in fact, 
remove lead. 

Other Item : 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing data for samples submitted by Flint residents 
through the free lead testing program.

Treasurer's Governor's Memorandum 3-15-13. docm 


Governor, 

Attached is the monthly local government update memo. As we discussed, I am not happy with the progress 
we are making revamping this department and will be taking a more hands on approach going forward. This is 
the third draft of this month's memo and it still lacks the concrete specifics I believe you expect and need. It 
will be more timely and have more concrete milestones going forward. However, as I know you like to catch 
up on your reading on the weekends, I am sending it despite the fact it is not ready for prime time. 

Some of the items I don't like in the attached are: 

It says we will meet with EMs over the next couple months, it won't take that long. 

Flint summary says no near term exit despite Governor and Mayor's contrary wishes. I will dig into this more 
deeply and report back. KWA misrepresented based on my mtg w engineering firm this week. Report I got is 
that Flint should stay w DWSD. 


Redacted 


Regards, 

Andy

Per your request, this memorandum summarizes the status of selected financially distressed units of 
local government. The following units of local government now are subject to Public Act 72 of 
1990, the Local Government Fiscal Responsibility Act. 

GENERAL ISSUES 

Cities Close to an Exit by EFM : 

H Ecorse - While most of the financial issues are resolved, the City Council without the State’s 
involvement, has the authority, through practice and a loosely worded city charter, to meddle 
in the day-to-day operations of the City, including selecting and supervising staff and setting 
their pay. Efforts to obtain a voluntary Inter Local Agreement have been frustrated by the 
unwillingness of a majority of Council to see the need for the oversight contemplated by the 
ILA. While we continue to work on a compromise, worst case is that we will impose a 
transition advisory board (TAB) under PA 436 in late March. 

H Pontiac - As explained below, Mr. Schimmel has a short list of projects to complete before 
he leaves this summer. Imposition of a TAB will be recommended. 

Retiree Health Care - In most of the EFM cities, and certainly in those cities that are struggling but 
not yet in receivership, the cost of promised retiree health care is a major concern. In Pontiac and 
Flint where changes in retiree health care were imposed under PA 4, lawsuits are pending leaving the 
effects of those changes uncertain. In Pontiac, the annual liability is about $6.0 million, which is also 
the amount of the City’s current annual operating deficit. Allen Park’s annual liability is 


www.michigan.gov/treasury 




Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 2 of 16 

approximately $2.5 million and Flint’s is nearly $20 million, half of which is in the general fund. 
While Flint and Pontiac have each taken steps to reduce the annual expense of the health coverage 
the retirees enjoy, those changes are being challenged. In most of our EFM cities, this issue is a 
difficult obstruction to fiscal balance. Pontiac, our most extreme case, has 52 current employees in 
the health care system compared to approximately 1200 retirees receiving health care. Treasury is 
working to develop a standard process to use when addressing retiree health care spending. 

EFM Exit Strategy - Treasury will be meeting individually with each EFM during the next two 
months to develop a timeline for them to exit the local unit. This timeline will include the specific 
financial and operational issues that must be resolved in order to exit; target dates for issue 
resolution; and a benchmarking component. Additionally, Treasury is crafting a list of criteria for 
each EFM city which establishes success and serves as benchmarks for returning each unit to local 
control. 

EMERGENCY MANAGER - Cities 
City of Allen Park 


H Update : Joyce Parker was appointed Emergency Financial Manager by the Emergency 
Loan Board on October 25, 2012, with duties beginning October 29. She also serves, part- 
time, as the Emergency Financial Manager for the City of Ecorse. 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had an operating surplus of $2,973,862, or 
18% of general fund revenues of $16,202,731. However, when transfers out of the general 
fund are taken into account, the financial picture is much worse. The City transferred $4.7 
million (net of transfers in) from the general fund, including a $2.4 million transfer associated 
with studio debt and a $2.5 million transfer to cover retirement health care. Based on these 
numbers, the City’s unrestricted accumulated general fund deficit is $1,090,225 or 6.7% of 
revenues. 

H Treasury is exploring the potential to restructure the studio debt. The EFM has listed the 
movie studio property for sale and is preparing a detailed Deficit Elimination Plan. The 
City’s financial distress is exacerbated by the minimum staffing requirements contained 
in the public safety collective bargaining agreements and the cost of retiree health care. 

H The Road Out: With our recent entrance into Allen Park, several general strategies are in 
play. As noted above, the budget is in deficit primarily because of the movie studio debt 
and the retiree health care obligations. However, labor contracts have minimum manning 
provisions that need to be resolved, and there are several areas of ongoing expense that 
can be reduced. Among other things, the EFM’s draft deficit elimination plan also 
includes personnel reductions (including police and fire), wage reductions, pension plan 
changes, active and retiree health care changes, reduction in sick days and holiday 
payouts, and revenue enhancements for rubbish and lights. Ms. Parker believes that it 
may be possible to balance these financial issues short of bankruptcy. However, that 
option is also being explored. Allen Park’s exit from Emergency Manager status will 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 3 of 16 

likely depend on Treasury’s ability to restructure the City’s movie studio debt and make 
significant adjustments to the City’s retiree healthcare liabilities. 

City of Benton Harbor 

H Joe Harris was appointed Emergency Financial Manager on August 8, 2012. The 
Emergency Loan Board terminated Mr. Harris’ contract effective January 31, 2013 and 
appointed Mr. Tony R. Saunders II as the new EFM effective February 1, 2013. 

H For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, Benton Harbor had an operating shortfall of 
$1,125,798, exceeding general fund revenues of $6,555,653 by 17%. The unrestricted 
accumulated general fund deficit is $2,285,483 or 34% of general fund revenues. The 
unrestricted deficit increased slightly over 2011 by approximately $56,000. 

H Update : The new EFM has established a working with relationship with the City 
Commission which has resulted in the Commission approving a resolution of support placing 
a millage proposal on the May ballot. The millage proposal, if approved, replaces the 10 mill 
special assessment levied during December 2012, with a 10 mill operating levy. The proposal 
will also include asking voters for a 3 mill increase . The EFM has requested and received an 
advancement of the April and June revenue sharing payments to address the cash shortage. 
A $2.5 million emergency loan application is anticipated during July. 

H The Road Out: Mr. Saunders is reviewing all City operational expenses in an effort to 
rationalize annual expenses and eliminate deficit spending. The large amount of accounts 
payable is a near-term focus. The water plant is a major liability, particularly since users in 
Benton and St. Joseph Townships have withdrawn from the system due to ongoing political 
and financial management concerns. The City charter needs to be updated, the performance 
of City Council needs to be improved, and ongoing liabilities for retiree health care are also 
an issue. OFR staff are working with the new EM on the water/sewer system debt, transfer 
of the pension system to MERS and reductions in staff. Treasury had anticipated that 
withdrawal from the City would be a near-term possibility if charter issues could be 
overcome. However, these recent revenue issues and the demise of the water system 
customer base, make a near-term exit more challenging. The new EM understands our desire 
to make an exit as soon as possible. 

City of Ecorse 


H Joyce Parker was appointed Emergency Financial Manager on August 8, 2012 by the 
Emergency Loan Board. She was first appointed Emergency Financial Manager on October 
30, 2009. She continues to serve Ecorse on a part-time basis while she also serves as 
Emergency Financial Manager for the City of Allen Park. 

H City Council is cool toward an interlocal agreement proposed by Treasury that would 
create an advisory board under the Urban Cooperation Act, PA 7 of 1967 (Ex. Session) 
and create a seamless transition process away from an EFM, allowing Ms. Parker to end 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 4 of 16 

her service there. A majority of Council believe such an advisory board is unnecessary. 
Treasury staff is redrafting the ILA to address some of the suggestions made by the AG. 
The revised agreement will be reviewed with the Council. 

H For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 the City had a general fund balance of $2,419,220 or 
18.8% of general fund revenues of $12,904,604 and experienced an operating surplus for the 
first time in several years. 

H The Road Out: The work of the EFM is essentially done. The remaining concern is with 
the City Council and the City charter language which allows substantial day-to-day 
involvement of the City Council. Discussions continue on an interlocal agreement to 
establish a Transition Advisory Board, as explained above. If this voluntary approach is 
not successful, a TAB can be imposed with the advent of PA 436 in late March. 

City of Flint 


H Edward Kurtz was appointed Emergency Financial Manager on August 8, 2012 by the 
Emergency Loan Board. He succeeded Mike Brown who was appointed Emergency 
Manager on November 29, 2011. The Emergency Financial Manager is anticipated to be in 
Flint for more than one year. Mr. Kurtz is taking a minimal salary as EFM, while Mike 
Brown now works as City Administrator, appointed by Mr. Kurtz. It is assumed that Mike 
Brown will be reappointed as EM in late March, and that Mr. Kurtz will be retained until 
June to consult with the City on the FY 2014 budget. 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City incurred a general fund operating shortfall of 
$10,169,828 exceeding general fund revenues of $51,497,686 by 20%. This resulted in an 
unrestricted accumulated general fund deficit of $19,184,850, which is 37% of general fund 
revenues. 

H Update : The City of Flint has been participating with Genesee County on the feasibility 
of the City’s use of a planned water pipe line from Lake Huron that would serve a large 
portion of Genesee County as an alternative to water supplied by DWSD. An 
engineering firm selected by Treasury to conduct an independent evaluation of Flint’s 
choices for water supply presented their findings on December 18 lh . This is a critical 
long-term decision for Flint and the region. The economics show that but for the excess 
cost of DWSD water during the three year construction period of the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) pipeline, the City will benefit from lower water costs in the long term 
by using the KWA water and treating the water in Flint at their own, existing, water 
treatment plant. A recent proposal shows that with cooperative efforts with the County, 
those excess costs can be further minimized. 

H The Budget for the current fiscal year encompasses both revenue increases and expenditure 
reductions in an effort to achieve a balanced budget. For example, the budget includes 
assessments for waste collection, for the operation, maintenance, and improvement of street 
lights, and a 25 percent increase in water and sewer rates. Voters overwhelmingly approved 
a 6 mill public safety millage in November that will substantially improve the FY 14 budget. 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 5 of 16 

On the expenditure reduction side, the budget reduces the City’s workforce by 150 positions 
(20 percent), and includes employee concessions and a restructuring of employee health care 
benefits. Retiree health care has been eliminated for future employees. Litigation is pending 
in federal court to preclude changes to retiree health care. The Emergency Financial 
Manager estimates that retiree health care costs will increase by $3.5 million during the 
current fiscal year if he is prevented from implementing the planned changes. 

H The City has recently submitted a five year deficit elimination plan that anticipates submittal 
of an emergency loan application of $12 million to address the accumulated deficit. The 
remainder of the unrestricted accumulated general fund deficit will be eliminated through 
$7.1 million in reductions. The City has not yet identified specific cuts but will do so as it 
works through the development of its fiscal year 2014 budget. The Department is assisting 
the City with the identification of possible reductions. 

H The City’s first contract with a private a solid waste removal firm was recently implemented. 
Republic Services hired 20 of the 24 former city employees who provided this service. 
Republic also purchased a number of former city waste vehicles and will implement 
recycling services during the summer of 2013. The transition has progressed smoothly. 

H The Road Out: This is the first year of the EFM’s balanced budget and they are currently on 
track with the budget. Major remaining issues are resolving public safety staffing and 
effectiveness; establishing new and cooperative approaches to water and sewer services; 
funding and maintaining infrastructure; defining and sustaining blight eradication strategies; 
and funding OPEB liabilities. Treasury will be meeting with Flint’s EFM during the next 
month to develop a timeline for him to exit the local unit. 

City of Pontiac 


H Fou Schimmel was appointed Emergency Financial Manager by the Emergency Foan Board 
on August 8, 2012. He was first appointed Emergency Manager on October 6, 2011. The 
Emergency Financial Manager is anticipated to complete his work by mid- 2013, but a viable 
oversight mechanism, such as a Transition Advisory Board (TAB) under PA 436 of 2012, 
will be necessary for this to happen. 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had an operating shortfall of $1,249,049 
exceeding general fund revenues of $38,709,018 by 3%. This resulted in an unrestricted 
accumulated general fund deficit of $4,748,117 or 12% of general fund revenues. For fiscal 
year 2013, the City’s financial position will benefit from the transfer of the Pontiac 
Wastewater Treatment Plant. From the assets received, $8.4 million was used to pay off a 
loan to the general fund from the water/sewer fund; $6 million was used for retiree healthcare 
bringing the 2013 budget into balance; $3.4 million will be applied to the accumulated deficit 
from fiscal year 2012. 

H The EFM reports that FY2014 would be balanced except for the $6.0 million required for 
health care costs associated with retired non-public safety employees, and those who are still

active employees. Retired public safety employees (there are no active Pontiac public safety 
employees) are covered by an existing VEBA. 

H The Emergency Financial Manager continues to minimize the number of unused vacant 
properties in the City that are city-owned. The demolition of the Phoenix Center and sale 
of land project remains on hold after Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael 
Warren issued an injunction barring the City from demolishing the Phoenix Center. 
Settlement negotiations are proceeding. 

H The partnership with Oakland County for a restructuring of the ownership of the Pontiac 
Wastewater Treatment Plant is essentially complete. The capitalization of assets created by 
the transfer generated approximately $55 million, which was used to reduce bond debt 
related to Fiscal Stabilization bonds, Water Supply system. Sewage Disposal system, and 
Building Authority. The transaction has dramatically improved the City’s cash position 
while also eliminating most of the City’s outstanding debt, and preserving a reasonable fund 
for infrastructure maintenance within the City. It is also projected that Pontiac users of the 
system will enjoy significant reductions in their costs for sewer services in future years. 

11 Update : The EFM continues to reduce general fund expenses. He has successfully 

negotiated cost reductions with the City's waste pickup contractor; secured agreement 
from the Chief Judge to control the City's subsidy to the 50th District Court by having the 
Court process its own employee payroll and pay court employees out of its own account 
instead of the City's general fund account; and he contracted out all remaining DPW 
services including the snow plowing of major streets with the Oakland County Road 
Commission. 

11 The Road Out: Mr. Schimmel expects to leave this summer and strongly supports the use 
of a transition advisory board. His list of tasks remaining are: Phoenix Center 
Demolition; sale of DPW building to Consumers Energy; auction of surplus stuff; 
provide for the redevelopment of the Hayes Jones Community Center; sale of various 
properties, including golf course; and substantially reduce the $6.0 million annual deficit 
related to retiree health care. Mr. Schimmel recently presented to Treasury a concept 
plan for utilizing apparent overfunding in two retirement plans to eliminate or 
dramatically reduce City costs for retiree health care. Treasury encouraged further 
refinement of the plan subject to certain conditions being addressed. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT - CITIES 
City of Detroit 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had an operating surplus of $105,842,769. 
However, when transfers out of the general fund are taken into account, the City’s financial 
position is much worse. The City transferred $236,542,790 with the largest transfer going to 
the transportation fund for $87.2 million, $61.2 million to the debt service fund, and $80.9 
million for interest payments on the pension obligation certificates. This resulted in an 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 7 of 16 

unrestricted accumulated deficit of $327,956,700 or 30% of general fund revenues of 
$1,100,342,313. 

H The City continues to implement the “countermeasures” developed in order to net 
approximately $117 million in cash improvements by June 30 and allow the City to maintain 
a positive (though minimal) cash position through the end of the fiscal year. Much of the cash 
savings are realized by deferring required payments into the next fiscal year. 

H On February 1, a first draft of the 5 year plan for the City was presented to the Review 
Team. The plan would eliminate the deficit within 5 years by significantly lowering 
employee costs. Changes include a reduction of an additional 500 FTEs, freezing all 
pension vesting for one year, moving all employees to a defined contribution plan after 
that, and capping health care expenditures at $125 million a year (compared to a current 
spend of roughly $190 million). Other potential savings being considered include 
additional headcount reductions/furloughs, asset sales, debt restructuring, and revenues. 
Update : As of early March, this has been expanded into a draft 10 year plan. 

H Update : Information provided by the City (but as yet unverified) indicates that the 
General Retirement System Pension Board has set aside $3 million of pension funds to 
fund a lawsuit against an Emergency Financial Manager, if one is named. 

H Update : The Detroit Public Lighting Authority board held its first meeting on March 1. 
While the authority cannot draw utility tax revenues until bonds are issued, the 
immediate focus is on getting a loan from the general fund to replace 10-15,000 lights 
that are out due to operational issues (as opposed to underlying infrastructure issues). 

H Update : Judge Cox, who currently oversees the Detroit Water and Sewerage 

Department (DWSD), has expressed an interest in ending federal oversight. Although 
non-binding, this will require initial agreement among stakeholders about the path going 
forward. Treasury generally supports a proposal to move DWSD to a semiautonomous 
authority. This course may significantly benefit the City however; it is also Treasury’s 
position that the City’s investment banker (Miller Buckfire) conduct a thorough analysis 
of the various options available, so that no action would be taken that would foreclose on 
any possibility. The “Root Cause Committee” (consisting of members from the City’s 
Administration, City Council and the Water Board), has drafted a non-binding report to 
be presented to Judge Cox in support of the authority option. The Judge had set a March 
15 deadline for completion of the report. 

City of Inkster 


H The City of Inkster operates under a Consent Agreement which was implemented 
effective February 28, 2012. 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had a general fund operating shortfall of 
$3,171,524 or 19% of general fund revenues of $15,859,971. The FY12 shortfall increased 


Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 8 of 16 

the City’s general fund unrestricted accumulated deficit to $3,604,783 or 22% of general 
fund revenues. 

H For FY13, the City reduced staffing by 20% and made other expenditure reductions. 
Current budget forecasts suggest a year end deficit of $1.7 million, consistent with the 
DEP. The most current budget to actual report shows the City’s general fund breaking 
even instead of generating a $600,000 surplus as budgeted. The City is preparing FY 
2012-13 budget amendments which include proposed reductions of $500,000. The 
projected loss in property value in the city for FY 2013-14 is 9. 2%. The City’s deficit 
elimination plan anticipates the FY14 budget will be balanced. Treasury is concerned 
about ongoing cooperation between the City Council and the city administration . City 
council’s consideration of FY 2012-13 budget amendments at their 3/18/2013 meeting 
will be enlightening. Staff from OFR regularly visits Inkster. 

City of River Rouge 

H The City of River Rouge operates under a consent agreement which was implemented 
effective December 15, 2009. 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had a general fund operating surplus of 
$1,302,690 or 11% of general fund revenues of $11,989,601. The surplus has reduced the 
unrestricted accumulated general fund deficit to $1,039,067 or 8.6% of general fund revenues 
of $1 1,989,601. The 2012 accumulated deficit is approximately half of the previous year’s 
deficit so progress is evident. However, the 2012 operating surplus is a result of the 
receipt of approximately $1.9 million in legal settlements. Had the legal settlements not 
occurred, the 2012 accumulated deficit would be an estimated $2,900,000. OFR staff 
visits with River Rouge and feels comfortable that their ongoing efforts to reduce costs, 
such as the recent implementation of a public safety officer model for combined police 
and fire services will help the City achieve its FY14 budget objective of balanced 
revenues and expenditures. Implementation of the Personal Property Tax reductions is 
anticipated to negatively impact the city. Efforts are underway to prepare more specific 
estimates of the impacts on both River Rouge and Ecorse, which have relied heavily on 
the PPT revenues from the Great Lakes steel mill. 

LOCAL UNITS OL INTEREST 

City of Hamtramck 


H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had a general fund operating shortfall of 
$3,303,385 which is 22% of general fund revenues of $14,827,148. This deficit eliminated 
the general fund balance and resulted in an unrestricted accumulated deficit of $753,733 or 
5% of general fund revenues. The cause of the imbalance was the result of the loss of 
revenue due to the expiration of the Poletown tax increment financing agreement and the 
failure of the City to reduce its expenditures accordingly. 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 9 of 16 

H The City has submitted an application for an emergency loan for $3 million. The 
Department is reviewing the application to determine if the City qualifies. In addition to 
the emergency loan, the City is pursuing the issuance of a tax anticipation note to address 
its cash shortage expected to occur during March 2013. 

H Late last year, the City Council voted to request a financial review by the State. Prior to 
initiating the requested review, Treasury asked for and the City has submitted a deficit 
elimination plan (DEP). The plan relies heavily on the receipt of an emergency loan, an 
increase in rental inspection fees, and an increase in traffic violation revenues. Given the 
inadequacy of the DEP, Treasury initiated a preliminary review on Monday; February 
1 land staff has completed the report. 

City of Highland Park 1 

H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had a general fund operating surplus of 
$1,293,462 or 12% of general fund revenues of $10,718,332. This increased the City’s 
unrestricted general fund balance to $2,199,762 or 20% of general fund revenues. The 
positive fund balance is a result of the restatement of accrued state revenue from the fiscal year 
2011 financial statements and, in large part, the forgiveness of a $4 mill ion payable due to DTE 
in 2011. Also a concern is the deficit in the water/sewer fund of approximately $6.7 million 
and the unfunded pension liability of $13.1 million. The unfunded liability for other post- 
employment benefits is $26 mi ll ion. 

H The City’s updated general fund projections indicate the City will reach a deficit situation 
during FY 2018. However, these forecasts do not address the possible consequences of 
various debt coming due within the next two years. Office of Fiscal Responsibility staff is 
working with local officials to develop and implement cost savings. 

H Update : The City has discontinued using their water treatment plant after attempting to 
implement MDEQ mandated improvements to the plant. Initial improvements were 
estimated at $340,000, but escalated to an estimated $5.9 million after valves and other 
essential parts of the system were found to be inoperable. The estimated cost to demolish the 
facility is $3.6 million. Currently, the City is purchasing water from DWSD. Negotiations 
continue between the City and DWSD with the intent of DWSD operating the City’s water 
and sewer utility systems. One challenge to finalizing this arrangement is the $8 million the 
City owes DWSD for sewage treatment. Treasury and City officials expect a proposal 
during April from DWSD which contains the prerequisites for a cooperative venture to 
proceed and also addresses the amortization of the City’s sewer debt to the DWSD. 


1 Several EFMs have been appointed in Highland Park. While the financial emergency in the City remains in effect, 
no replacement EFM has been appointed. Treasury is working with the Mayor and Council, without an EFM 
appointment, to get the City out of the business of providing public services. 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 10 of 16 

H The Road Out: Highland Park’s broken water system needs multiple strategies for 

resolution. DWSD is the major focus here for delivery of treated water and administration of 
water and sewer bills. The City’s existing water treatment facilities are in need of demolition, 
which will be expensive. In addition to typical OPEB liabilities, H.P. also has a major, bank- 
funded debt because of a court order related to delinquent payments to police pension funds. 
That debt will need restructuring in the next 24 months. The continuing effort to minimize 
the services the City provides makes the City a prime candidate for participation in regional 
public safety. 

The following units of local government are not currently subject to Public Act 72 of 1990, the Local 
Government Fiscal Responsibility Act: 

Royal Oak Township 

H The township had an operating deficit of $132,358 and an unrestricted general fund 
balance of a negative $34,821 at year end 2011. The unrestricted deficit was 3.6% of 
general fund revenues. However, the operating deficit is 14% of general fund revenues. 
The unrestricted deficit decreased significantly from 2010 to 2011; a negative $284,416 
in 2010 to a negative $34,821. This appears to be related, in part to a 2011 interfund 
transfer between the Parks and Recreation Fund (dedicated millage) and the Senior 
/Transportation fund. There is no money budgeted to repay the loan. There is also a loan 
with a local bank that was not obtained in accordance with regulations, as well as 
accusations of credit card misuse. Office of Fiscal Responsibility staff recently met with 
the newly elected Supervisor, Attorney and Financial consultant to discuss the 
Township’s anticipated cash flow shortage during May. Subsequent discussion with staff 
from the Local Audit and Finance Division regarding potential borrowings by the 
Township also took place. Staff continues its discussions with the Supervisor, 
Treasurer and Clerk to improve the Township’s financial practices. 

City of Taylor 


H For fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the City had a general fund operating shortfall of 
$3,905,004 exceeding general fund revenues of $40,444,430 by 9.6%. This excessive 
spending increased the general fund unrestricted accumulated deficit to $5,359,732 from 
approximately $1.7 million in 2011. The general fund borrowed $2 million from the 
water and sewer funds with no apparent commitment for repayment within a prescribed 
time period. 

H The City fell short of its deficit elimination projections by a minimum of $1.0 million. 
The majority of this can be attributed to Public Safety, which exceeded its budget 
expenditures by $881,610. Consequently, the City has submitted an updated deficit 
elimination plan. Staff is reviewing the updated plan to determine if it is reasonable and 
achievable and will require the City to submit monthly reports to monitor its adherence to 
the new plan 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 11 of 16 

H The relationship between the Mayor and City Council remains contentious. Rather than 
work together to solve the City’s fiscal dilemmas, the City Council tends to make 
decisions that seem intended to confront the Mayor. Sometimes, those decisions result in 
further aggravation of the City’s financial condition. 

County of Wayne 


H For fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, the County had a general fund operating surplus 
of $73,158,000, or 14% of general fund revenues totaling $532,919,000. However, the 
general fund transferred $1 13,158,000 to other funds thereby increasing the 2011 unrestricted 
accumulated general fund deficit to $148,925,000, which is 28% of general fund revenues. 

H A revised deficit elimination plan has been submitted. Staff is working with the County 
to resolve several issues within the plan such as the transfer of assets from other funds 
and unsupported reductions to eliminate the general fund deficit. 

H Update : Phase II of the State’s consulting engagement contract with Pierce, Monroe & 
Associates to examine the funds of elected officials and other select departments was 
completed by the February deadline including examination of the substantial balance 
amount in the Treasurer’s Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund.. Anticipated future County 
borrowing, if any, will be conditioned to require changes in the financial behavior within 
County government. Treasury remains very concerned about the probability of jail 
construction cost overruns. 

H The County has submitted an application to issue $90 million in tax anticipation notes, 
has committed to updating its deficit elimination plan to include the most recent deficit 
and to address concerns in a timely manner. They intend to submit monthly financial 
reports so that the Department may monitor the County's adherence to the plan. The 
Department will issue a conditional approval of the deficit elimination plan and approve 
the borrowing. However, the proceeds of the borrowing will be placed in an escrow 
account and draws will be approved by the Department subject to the County meeting 
certain budgeting goals.

LITIGATION SUMMARY 

1. AFSCME 25, et al v Governor, el al. This action was filed in United States District 
Court (Eastern District). The claim is that modifications by the Emergency Manager for 
Detroit Public Schools to collective bargaining agreements violated various constitutional 
provisions (e.g., the Contracts Clause and Takings Clause). 

Status: Cross motions for summary disposition were pending. A motion hearing was 
held on November 1, 2012, and the Court took the matter under advisement. 

2. Bland v Brown, Kurtz, et al. This action was filed in Genesee County Circuit Court. 
This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief and mandamus. The claim is that 
the Emergency Manager transferred the assets of the Flint Retirement System to the 
Municipal Employees Retirement System of Michigan (MERS) in violation of Act 4. 
Section 19(l)(m)(iii) of the Act authorizes such a transfer provided the recipient pension 
fund is actuarially funded at a level of 80 percent or more. The claim is that MERS as of 
December 31, 2010 was funded at only 76 percent. 

Status: A pre-trial conference was held the last week of October 2012. 

3. Brown v Snyder. This action was filed in Ingham County Circuit Court. The claim is that 
Act 4 is unconstitutional, facially and as applied. The State sought a protective order in 
regards to discovery which the trial court denied. On appeal, the Court of Appeals 
vacated the denial of the requested protective order and remanded. The trial court 
hearing on remand is September 26, 2012. 

Status: The case was dismissed. The parties on November 19, 2012, signed stipulations 
and a voluntary dismissal. 

4. Citizens United Against Corrupt Government, et al v City of Detroit, et al. This action was 
filed in Ingham County Circuit Court. The claim is that a contract by Mayor with an 
outside law firm violates City charter. 

Status: Awaiting a hearing date. 

5. Citizens United Against Corrupt Government, et al v Detroit Financial Advisory Board. 
This action was filed in the Court of Appeals. This is an action for quo warranto. The 
claim is that, among other things, no portion of the Financial Stability Agreement, 
including the Financial Advisory Board, survived the disapproval of Act 4 by the voters. 

Status: The case is pending having been filed on December 10, 2012. 

6. Citizens United Against Corrupt Government, et al v Detroit Financial Review Team. This 
action was filed in Ingham County Circuit Court. The claim is that negotiation of the 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 13 of 16 


Financial Stability Agreement, as well as two provisions of the Financial Stability 
Agreement, violated Act 4. The case was dismissed by the Ingham County Circuit Court. 

Status: Plaintiff filed a claim of appeal with the Court of Appeals and plaintiff’s brief is 
due on December 26, 2012. 

7. Coletta et al v David Clark et al. This action was filed in Wayne County Circuit Court 
and has been certified as a class action involving approximately 9,000 plaintiffs. This is 
an action for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. The claim is that trustees of 
the City of Detroit’s General Employees Retirement system and the Police and Fire 
Retirement system violated various laws and breached certain fiduciary duties in regards 
to the investment of pension assets. 

8. Davis v Detroit Financial Advisory Board. This action was filed in Ingham County 
Circuit Court. The claim was that the Board violated the Open Meetings Act. 

Status: The case was dismissed. 

9. Davis v Detroit Financial Review Team , et al. This action was filed in Ingham County 
Circuit Court. The claims were that review teams were subject to the Open Meetings Act 
and that the Detroit Financial Review Team had acted in violation of a trial court order. 
The Court of Appeals held on May 21, 2012, that review teams are not subject to the 
Open Meetings Act, but remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on the 
issue whether defendants should be held in contempt. Subsequently, the trial court 
declined to hold an evidentiary hearing and plaintiff appealed that decision to the Court 
of Appeals. 

Status: Payment of plaintiff’s costs and attorney fees rendered moot the need for an 
evidentiary hearing. 

10. Davis v Highland Park Financial Review Team (referred to as Highland Park 11 to 
distinguish it from the first Highland Park case which claimed that review teams were 
subject to the Open Meetings Act). This action was filed in Ingham County Circuit 
Court. The claims are that the terms of review team members expire 60 day (90 day with 
an extension) after appointment and that Act 4 violated Section 29 of the Headlee 
Amendment. The trial court dismissed the former claim, but held that Act 4 did violate 
the Headlee Amendment. 

Status: Plaintiff failed to file a brief. 

11. Davis v Parker. This is an action for quo warranto. This action was filed in the Court of 
Appeals after the foregoing case was filed in Ingham County Circuit Court. The claims are 
that the Emergency Financial Manager has no entitlement to her office because the statutory 
process of Act 72 was not followed and that Act 72 is not revived because it was repealed 
by Act 4. 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 14 of 16 


Status: The Court of Appeals denied application for leave to proceed by quo warranto. 

12. Davis v Rick Snyder, Michael Flanagan, and Joyce Parker. This action was filed in 
Ingham County Circuit Court. This is an action for declaratory judgment. The claims are 
that the statutory process of Act 72 was not followed, that Act 72 does not authorize the 
grandfathering of actions taken under Act 4, and that the criteria for appointment of 
emergency managers under Act 4 and emergency financial managers under Act 72 differ. 

Status: A motion hearing is scheduled on January 30, 2013. 

13. Davis v Roberts. This action was filed with the Michigan Supreme Court. The action is 
for quo warranto. The claims are that the Emergency Financial Manager has no entitlement 
to his office because the statutory process of Act 72 was not followed and that Act 72 is not 
revived because it was repealed by Act 4. The Court of Appeals previously denied relief 
and held that Act was revived. 

14. Davis v State of Michigan, City of Detroit, et al. This action was filed in Ingham County 
Circuit Court. The claim is that the financial stability agreement violates the Headlee 
Amendment. The trial court denied plaintiffs motion for an evidentiary hearing, but allowed 
depositions. The Court of Appeals granted the State’s application for leave to appeal. 
Defendants filed a reply brief on September 27, 2012. 

Status: The Court of Appeals held oral arguments on December 5, 2012. The matter is 
awaiting decision. 

15. DPOA v City of Detroit. This action was filed in Wayne County Circuit Court. This was 
an action for injunctive relief. The claim was that duty to engage in Act 312 arbitration 
survived the duty to bargain under the Public Employment Relations Act. On August 30, 
2012, the Court granted the State’s motion to intervene, dissolved a previously entered 
temporary restraining order, refused to enter a preliminary injunction, and determined 
that the City’s employment terms are controlling until a new agreement is reached. The 
Court dismissed the case. 

Status: DPOA filed with the Court of Appeals a claim of appeal and motion to stay, the 
latter of which the Court denied. 

16. DPOA v City of Detroit. This action was filed in the Court of Claims (Ingham County 
Circuit Court). The claim is that the duty to engage in Act 312 arbitration survived the 
duty to bargain under the Public Employment Relations Act. 

Status: Supplemental briefs have been filed by all parties who are awaiting a decision. 

17. FPOA v City of Flint. This action was filed in Genesee County Circuit Court. This is an 
action for injunctive relief. The claim is that an Emergency Manager order which 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 15 of 16 

imposed a labor contract should be invalidated because the statute under which it was 
issued, Act 4 of 201 1, no longer is in effect. 

18. Kincaid v Kurtz. This action was filed in Genesee County Circuit Court. This is an 
action for quo warranto against the Flint Emergency Financial Manager. The claim is 
that the appointment of the Emergency Financial Manager is unconstitutional because 
Act 72 was repealed by Act 4 and, per the anti-revival statute (MCL 8.4), Act 72 was not 
revived upon the suspension of Act 4. Plaintiff’s amended complaint and brief as 
requested by the Court were due on November 19, 2012. A hearing was scheduled on 
November 26, 2012. The Court granted a motion to adjourn the November 26, 2012, 
hearing which was rescheduled for December 20, 2012. 

Status: The case was dismissed on December 20, 2012. 

19. NCO Acquisitions, LLC, et al v Governor, et al. This action was filed in United States 
District Court (Eastern District). The claim is that termination lease by Emergency 
Manager for Detroit Public Schools violated the Contracts Clause and Takings Clause of 
the federal Constitution. 

Status: The parties have filed cross motions for summary disposition and a hearing has 
been scheduled for January 9, 2013. 

20. Roberts v Murray, et al, and Detroit Board of Education. This action was filed in Wayne 
County Circuit Court. This was an action for injunctive relief filed by the Emergency 
Financial Manager with a cross claim for injunctive relief by the School Board. The Court 
adopted the position set out in Attorney General Opinion No. 7267 that Act 72 is revived 
during the suspension of Act 4. The Court also held that actions taken under Act 4 prior to 
the time of its suspension remained valid. 

Status: Not available. 

21. Sutton v Brown. This action was filed in Ingham County Circuit Court. The claim was 
that the appointment of Mike Brown as Emergency Manager for the City of Flint violated 
the Headlee Amendment. On August 8, 2012, the trial court dismissed the complaint due 
to lack of service by plaintiff. 

Status: The case was dismissed. 

22. Valenti v Snyder, et al. This action was filed in United States District Court (Eastern 
District). The claim is that the Detroit financial stability agreement violated the contracts 
clause, procedural due process, and amounted to a tortious interference with contractual 
relations. The Court concluded that the suspension of Act 4 rendered the case moot, but 
that the case could be revisited depending upon the outcome of the Act 4 referendum. 



Governor Snyder 
March 15, 2013 
Page 16 of 16 

Status: The case was dismissed, but on January 24, 2013, plaintiffs filed a motion with 
the court to reopen the case. 

23. Watkins, et al v the Governor, State Treasurer, and Attorney General. This action was 
filed in Ingham County Circuit Court on behalf of two members of the Pontiac City Council, 
four members of the Benton Harbor City Commission, and all nine members of the Flint 
City Council. This is an action for mandamus or, in the alternative, declaratory, and 
injunctive relief. The plaintiffs seek to have the reappointments of the seven existing 
emergency financial managers declared invalid on grounds that the suspension of Act 4 
did not revive Act 72. 

Status: The case was dismissed. At a motion hearing on December 5, 2012, the Ingham 
County Circuit Court denied plaintiffs’ requested relief and granted summary disposition 
in favor of the State. 

24. Welch et al v Brown, Kurtz, et al. This action was filed in United States District Court 
(Eastern District). This is a class action for injunctive relief and damages. The claim is 
that changes implemented by the Emergency Manager under Act 4 and to be 
implemented under Act 72 to retiree healthcare violate certain constitutional and 
contractual rights of retirees. At a hearing on September 6, 2012, the Court declined to 
grant an injunction. Instead, the Court directed the parties to meet. The Court was of the 
opinion that plaintiffs appeared to misunderstand the nature of changes to their coverage 
and should first meet with city representatives to discuss those changes. 


Status: The meeting between plaintiffs counsel and City's counsel was held and plaintiffs 
are expected to continue litigation.

They have been notified per the plan and have until Andy returns next week to present their counter proposal. The 
concept is executed. Sorry for the confusion but they haven't followed up with Flint and I thought you should know we 
were moving to the next step at the end of the ten days. I was indicating that we were expecting to move forward in 
case you had further reservations and wanted us to delay further.

Before I left, I thought all of us agreed that someone would let DWSD know that they were going to lose a key customer 
and that they would have 10 days to present a serious counter. What happened to this concept? 


Thanks

As you know, the Flint people have requested Dillon's ok to break away from the DWSD. Andy has reviewed the 
proposed action, had it analyzed by Treasury and Dan Wyant and DEQ, and they all agree that Flint is correct. I have no 
way of determining whether this is the right action except to depend on the two departments charged with this 
responsibility, so I recommend that we support their determination and let the chips fall where they may. This will 
happen early next week, so we need to have you made aware and develop a message of support if that is what you want 
to do. 




We'll need to make sure that Orr knows about this as soon as possible so he can take it into his calculations. It would 
certainly diminish the DWSD base, and probably spin off a series of political questions for others still involved in the 
Detroit system. But, I don't see how you can support Detroit to the detriment of the rest of the state. You've done a lot 
for the city, but you also need to have a strong support for outstate for 2014. 


Sorry to bug you on your vacation, but the two emails today couldn't be avoided. I was trying to think of a way to make 
it up to you, so here goes: GO BLUE! (That was really tough to say...).

Governor, 

I am sending this only because I know you may have some time this weekend to catch up on some reading and, 
if you were curious, it would be available to you. I still need to meet with E&Y and the City to go through this 
and formulate my recommendation to you. Thus, not asking you to read it - just making it available. 

Within two weeks, I expect to ask for some time to discuss Flint, Highland Park and a few other local units on 
my radar.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Allen Park 

Emergency Manager: Joyce Parker 
Appointed: October 26, 2012 
Anticipated Exit: September 2014 

Recent Developments 

The sale of Southfield Lease Properties to Time Equities for $12M is expected to close in 
August 2014. The purchaser has exercised their right to conduct an environmental 
review of the property which has delayed the closing. 

The City has requested a $2.7M emergency loan, which will likely be considered by the 
Emergency Loan Board at an August meeting. If approved, proceeds would be used to 
pay the delinquent pension obligation. Recent actuarial valuation revealed pension 
funding for General Employees at 79.22% and Police/Fire at 79.5%. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A ten year, $6.7M Public Safety Millage was approved by voters in August 2013. 

Future OPEB liabilities reduced by $48. 8M (33%). 

Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the Emergency Manager’s authority to reduce 
OPEB liabilities. A court date on this matter is pending. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Complete tender offer and debt refinancing related to the Southfield Lease Properties by 
September 2014. 

Finalize compliance settlement with SEC. 

Reduce pension liabilities.

Appointed: November 28, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: April 2015 

Recent Developments 

Overall deficit reduced to $9M in FY 2014. 

The Federal District Court Judge modified the preliminary injunction on June 30, 2014.

A $1.1M State appropriation was received to fund front-line public safety positions for 
FY 2015. 

The Emergency Manager has imposed collective bargaining agreement terms that will 
save the City $336k annually with long-term projected savings of $4.3M effective July 
2014. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Eliminate annual operating/structural deficit which is projected at $1.7M for FY 2017, 
and grows to $1 1.9M during FY 2019 if the City loses the lawsuit over retiree health.

FY 2015 budget is balanced. 

The City Commission appointed Mary Donald to the fill the vacant Commission seat. 
Due to a pending resignation, a second City Commission vacancy will occur in August.

The RTAB first annual evaluation is underway. 

Plante Moran has suspended their previous letter of termination, contingent on certain 
conditions, (e.g. begin immediate search for permanent City Administrator, contract with 
neighboring community or an outside agency to provide HR services to the City) . 

Significant Actions/Issues 

City Council has repeatedly rejected a CGAP grant which would have saved the City 
$1M, offsetting the lost tax settlement revenue. 

Pension contributions are anticipated to increase from $1.8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 
2016. 

The RTAB rejected the City’s proposed five-year budget in June 2014 due to unrealistic 
projections. The firing of the City Administrator and the uncertainty of Plante Moran’s 
continued financial services have delayed the completion of a viable five-year budget. 
The amended budget completion date is unknown.

OTHER COMMUNITIES 
Melvindale 


Significant Actions/Issues 

The General fund deficit for FY 2013 is $1 ,9M, an increase of $24 8k from the FY 2012 
deficit. 

City’s ice arena unrestricted annual deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, which is approximately 
$160k more than what the City projected. It continues to negatively impact the General 
Fund. 

Treasury representatives will meet with city officials in August to discuss strategies of 
addressing deficits. 

The City is considering millage proposals for the November ballot. The first is to pay the 
debt on the ice arena and the other is for street/sidewalk repair. 



Page 8 


Taylor 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund has an unrestricted deficit of $2.2M. 

The City made only 47% of its required annual contribution for OPEB. The unfunded 
liability is $232. 7M and continues to grow. 

There are several contingent liabilities that may impact the financial stability of the City 
including the possible need to subsidize Brownfield Redevelopment bonds of $14.2M. 

A 1996 levy to pay a general obligation bond expires in 2015, potentially resulting in a 
$6.2M drain per year on the General Fund during FY 2016 and FY 2017. 

City of Wayne 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Projected General Fund deficits for FY 2014 and beyond. 

Treasury prepared and presented recommendations for the City during April 2014. 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

Warren Evans defeated Robert Ficano with 44% of the vote in the primary election held 
August 5, 2014. 

The County Finance Director continues to pursue the implementation of the Waste Water 
Authority by meeting with the affected local units and the attorneys for several of the 
existing systems. 

The County believes it has sufficient documentation to support the County’s ownership 
of the various waste water systems. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Treasury met with County Finance officials on July 1, 2014 to discuss progress on the 
Deficit Elimination Plan (DEP). Another meeting is scheduled for August 18, 2014. The 
County submitted a revised DEP, approved by the County Commission, which removes 
the changes to retiree healthcare. The loss of the $9.2M in savings will be offset by the 
$10M anticipated increase in revenue sharing. 

County Treasurer agreed to transfer $150M from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to 
the General Fund. Of that $150M, $82M has already been transferred and applied to the 
accumulated deficit, and $44M has been applied to the operating/structural deficit in 
accordance with the DEP. The additional $24M, which was not part of the DEP, will be 
used to help reduce the accumulated deficit. 

The elimination of the accumulated deficit is dependent upon the transfer of excess funds 
held in the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund and the creation of a Wastewater Authority. 
The plan to eliminate the operating/structural deficit depends on significant labor costs 
savings and pension revisions. 



Page 9 


The Treasurer received letters from the law firm of Foster Swift and the Downriver 
Utility Wastewater Authority on behalf of several communities affected by the Waste 
Water Authority proposed in the County’s DEP. They expressed disagreement with the 
plan and also questioned the ownership of the assets. 

The County reduced the amount needed to borrow for general operating cash flow 
purposes from $100M to $75M. The Tax Anticipation note was issued on May 28, 2014 
and the proceeds were placed in escrow. 

The County received $25M of its cash flow borrowing of May 28, 2014 upon closing. A 
second draw in the amount of $25M was approved by Treasury on July 2, 2014 leaving a 
balance of $25M in escrow. Estimated final release date is expected to be by August 15, 
2014.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Flint 

Emergency Manager: Darnell Earley 
Appointed: November 28, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: April 2015 

Recent Developments 

Emergency Manager Darnell Earley initiated a search for a qualified and experienced 
City Administrator. Ideally, the chosen candidate will begin on January 30, 2015. 

Five Charter amendments and a general Charter revision question have been placed on 
the November 2014 ballot. These include eliminating the Office of Ombudsmen and 
Civil Service Commission, reducing mayoral staff appointments from ten to five, 
eliminating the requirement for specific executive departments, and requiring that the 
annual budget include a budget message, multi-year financial plans, revenue projections, 
and a Budget Stabilization Fund. 

The City has contacted the Michigan Health Endowment Fund at MDCH to determine if 
grant funds are available to start a fund to assist citizens who are unable to pay their 
water/sewer bills. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On September 5, 2014 a boil water advisory was issued due to multiple positive tests for 
“total col i form” covering approximately a 9 square mile area. This was caused from a 
broken valve which feeds the transition main. 

In August, Treasury staff met with the Mayor and City Council in one-on-one meetings 
to discuss the possibility of the Emergency Manager exiting in April 2015, and to explain 
the function of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. An April 2015 exit will not be 
possible if the pending retiree lawsuit outcome is unfavorable to the City. Decision date 
is still to be determined. 

Accumulated deficit for FY 2013 was $12. 9M; the City reduced the deficit by $3.9M to 
$9M in FY 2014 (unaudited).

FY 2015. 

The sale of the water pipeline for $3.9M was completed in June 2014. 

The Genesee County 911 Consortium approved Flint’s return to the county-wide system 
by July 1, 2015. This will result in about $1M in annual savings to the City. Currently, 
the City spends $2.4M annually to subsidize its own 911 operations. 

The results of a comprehensive public safety study, being prepared by ICMA, will be 
available this fall. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Eliminate annual operating/structural deficit which is projected at $1.7M for FY 2017, 
and grows to $1 1.9M by FY 2019 if the City loses the lawsuit over retiree healthcare. 

If the City loses this lawsuit, it will permanently add $5M annually to the cost of retiree 
healthcare. The City’s budget does not assume this additional $5M potential expense.

Anticipated Exit: November 2014 

Recent Developments 

Both the Public Works Director and the Income Tax Director have been terminated for 
misfeasance; a replacement Public Works Director is being vetted, while the Income Tax 
Office has been outsourced to a third party. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A firm has been hired to conduct a search for a qualified City Manager candidate. 

The City closed on its emergency loan on September 23, 2014, which was approved by 
the Emergency Loan Board on June 26, 2014. The proceeds will resolve a $2.1M 
liability to MERS. 

Retiree healthcare changes were implemented in December 2013 at a cost savings of over 
$1.8M. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 2015 to $4.3M 
in 2019. This resulted from the closing of certain pension plans and the MERS policy of 
accelerating the actuarial required contribution for closed plans.

Significant Actions/Issues 

The Police and Fire pension plan is 30% funded. The General Employee plan is 22% 
funded. 

An Emergency Manager Order to charge $60 for each vehicle towed by the City will 
result in additional revenue of $100,000 per year. 

A Financial and Operating Plan was submitted to the Treasurer on August 22, 2014. The 
Plan’s proposal includes 1) Fire Department restructuring - $1M annual savings, 2) 
OPEB plan reform or elimination - $3.2M+ for duration of fiscal emergency, 3) CBA 
changes include sick, vacation, unused sick and vacation buy backs, average final 
compensation, etc. This will likely result in hundreds of thousands in annual savings, 4) 
health plan changes - $150K annual savings, and 5) outsource Building Department - 
$75K annual savings. 

FY 2013 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $89K. In the prior FY, the 
City had a positive fund balance of $2M.

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

Emergency Manager: Kevyn Orr 
Appointed: March 14, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: November 2014 

Recent Developments 

On September 25, 2014, Mayor Duggan and the City Council reached a deal to keep 
Kevyn Orr on as Emergency Manager until the court approves the City’s Plan of 
Adjustment. Mr. Orr’s remaining tenure is strictly limited to those actions necessary to 
bring the bankruptcy proceedings to a close. 

As part of this arrangement, Kevyn Orr signed an order to return all operational authority 
to the City. While most operational duties had already been returned, Kevyn Orr had 
continued to oversee the financial and budgetary functions of the City prior to September 
25, 2014. 

Mr. Orr also signed several orders to effectuate restructuring and consolidation of City 
functions. These included finance and budgetary functions, as well as information 
technology, planning, and grants management functions. 

While the court’s exact timeline cannot be known, it is anticipated that proceedings could 
end over the next 3-6 weeks. In preparation, Treasury is coordinating with the 
Governor’s Office to implement the new Financial Review Commission, which is 
required by the “Grand Bargain” legislation. This commission will help to ensure the full 
and timely implementation of the City’s Plan of Adjustment.

Significant Actions/Issues 

On September 26, 2014, the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board 
approved exit financing for the City. This included the approval of four bond deals that, 
taken together, are worth up to $1. IB. All bonds had been previously approved by City 
Council. 

On the same day, the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board also approved 
the Emergency Manager’s proposal to sell several properties in the footprint of the New 
International Trade Crossing to the Land Bank Fast Track Authority for a total of $1.4M.

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

Emergency Manager Joyce Parker exited on September 25, 2014 and a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board was appointed. 

A $2.6M emergency loan was approved by the Emergency Loan Board on September 23, 
2014 with the closing occurring the same day. The proceeds will be used to pay the 
delinquent pension obligation. Recent actuarial valuation revealed pension funding for 
General Employees at 79.2% and Police/Fire at 79.5%. 

Significant Actions/Issues

Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the Emergency Manager’s authority to reduce 
OPEB liabilities. A court date on this matter is pending. 

The Southfield Lease Properties were sold on August 22, 2014 to Time Equities for 
$12M. 

A compliance settlement with SEC must be finalized. 

A five-year financial forecast must be developed within 90 days of the Emergency 
Manager exit. 

The restructuring of the Southfield Lease Properties Debt and Tender Offer must be 
completed. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Cary Vaughn, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The City submitted a $4.8M Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) which was approved by 
the RTAB on September 24, 2014. 

A litigation study was recently completed by UHY which will assist the City in 
improving its process of managing legal and litigation issues. 

Due to the resignation of another City Commissioner, a new vacancy has occurred on the 
City Commission. It is anticipated that the vacancy will be filled by November 2014.

Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The City continues to search for a qualified interim City Administrator, and is currently 
operating without one. 

The RTAB annual evaluation will be voted on at the November meeting; while some 
elements are positive or neutral, much of the report is negative. An eventual 
recommendation for the reappointment of an Emergency Manager is foreseeable. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

City Council repeatedly rejected a CGAP grant which would have saved the City $1M; 
offsetting the lost tax settlement revenue. 

Pension contributions are anticipated to increase from $1.8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 
2016. 

The State has approved $750K in State Revolving Funds for a sanitary sewer project. 

The RTAB rejected the City’s proposed five-year budget in June 2014 due to unrealistic 
projections. The firing of the City Administrator and the uncertainty of Plante Moran’s 
continued financial services have delayed the completion of a viable five-year budget. 
The amended budget completion date is unknown. 

Plante Moran has renewed their call for reform within the City (e.g. begin immediate 
search for permanent City Administrator, contract with neighboring community or an 
outside agency to provide HR services to the City). Plante Moran’s future with the City 
is in doubt due to the City’s failure to meet the conditions it previously agreed to. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was recently reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to 
Judge Avern Cohn. Judge Cohn has requested the parties participate in facilitation as a 
means to reaching a settlement. The City of Pontiac and the Retired Employees 
Association have agreed to participate in facilitation. 

In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. Interviews are tentatively scheduled on October 20 and 21, 2014. 



Page 6 


Significant Actions/Issues 

General Fund accumulated fund balance for FY 2014 is approximately $4M. 

The RTAB is currently reviewing the City’s proposed FY 2016 budget, which will be the 
City’s first adopted budget since the Emergency Manager’s required two-year budget. 
General Fund is structurally balanced in FY 2015 and expenditures are projected to 
exceed revenues by $360K. 

The $6M annual retiree healthcare obligation and related federal litigation must be 
resolved prior to August 2015, when the existing Emergency Manager Final Order 
regulating this issue expires. Expiration of this order would increase the annual cost of 
retiree healthcare to between S10-13M, which would be approximately one-third of the 
City’s $30M General Fund budget. 

The General Employee Retirement System application for tax exempt status was 
extended for another five year period by the IRS until December 31, 2019, as required by 
federal law. This extension resolves the issue of the proposed 420 Transfer and the 
RTAB has ceased review of the issue unless the City presents any new proposals. 

The City expects condemnation litigation involving the Phoenix Center building to be 
resolved in the near future. At that time, the City will proceed with the budgeted $2M 
demolition of the building. 

The City Charter Commission has completed a draft of a new City Charter, which is 
under review by the Office of the Attorney General. The Charter will eventually have to 
be adopted by a vote of the electorate. A possible election date has yet to be determined. 
The City Administrator has informed the RTAB that additional financial training for the 
City Council is needed.

deficiencies identified in its FY 2013 Audit; Treasury is currently reviewing the plan. 
Surplus pension assets of $619K administered by MERS were transferred to the 
Township. The State Treasurer approved a Consent Agreement Order by the Township 
Supervisor prohibiting the use of these funds until the Financial & Operating Plan is 
approved. The Office of the Attorney General is reviewing the legal authority regarding 
the use of these funds for any purpose other than pension expenses.

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, an increase of $248K from the FY 2012 
deficit. 

The City’s ice arena unrestricted annual deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, which is 
approximately $160K more than what the City projected. It continues to negatively 
impact the General Fund. 

The City met with Treasury representatives on August 19, 2014 to discuss the City’s 
proposed deficit elimination plan. The City provided a well-crafted plan and it is under 
review by Treasury. 

The City Council approved placing two millage proposals on the November ballot. The 
first is to pay the debt on the ice arena and the other is for street/sidewalk repair. 


Taylor 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund has an unrestricted deficit of $2.2M for FY 2013. 

The City made only 47% of its required annual contribution for OPEB. The unfunded 
liability is $232. 7M and continues to grow. 

There are several contingent liabilities that may impact the financial stability of the City , 
including the possible need to subsidize Brownfield Redevelopment Bonds of $14.2M. 

A 1996 levy to pay a general obligation bond expires in 2015, potentially resulting in a 
$6.2M drain per year on the General Fund during FY 2016 and FY 2017. 

City of Wayne 

Recent Developments 

City Manager Joe Merucci resigned, effective October 11, 2014 and has taken an

The City is discussing a May 2015 ballot proposal that would seek voter approval for 
additional millage. 

The positions of Finance Director, Personnel Director, and Parks and Recreation Director 
are currently vacant. 

The Mayor of the City of Westland has publically expressed concern about the stability 
of the City of Wayne and the collaborative agreements between the two cities. 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

In a letter from the Director of Labor Relations, the Director indicated that negotiations 
with all bargaining units have stalled. 

The County anticipates another short-term borrowing in December 2014 for $75M. Cash 
reserves reaches its lowest point in May 2015 with pooled cash falling to approximately 
$63M (average balance is $170M). 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The County submitted a revised DEP, approved by the County Commission, which 
removes the changes to retiree healthcare. The loss of the $9.2M in savings will be offset 
by the $10M anticipated increase in revenue sharing. County Treasurer agreed to transfer 
$150M from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to the General Fund. Of that $150M, 
$82M has already been transferred and applied to the accumulated deficit, and $44M has 
been applied to the operating/structural deficit in accordance with the DEP. The 
additional $24M, which was not part of the DEP, will be used to help reduce the 
accumulated deficit. 

Approval of the County’s revised DEP is on hold until the new Wayne County Executive 
takes office.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Flint 

Emergency Manager: Darnell Earley 
Appointed: November 28, 2013 
Anticipated Exit: April 2015 

Recent Developments 

Two City Council seats will be vacant as of January 1, 2015 due to the members being 
elected to higher offices. A committee consisting of the Mayor and City Council is 
working with the Emergency Manager to review interested applicants for the vacant City 
Council positions. 

City officials are attempting to increase the City’s income tax rate, which Treasury 
supports and must be approved by the legislature. State Representative Stanley is the 
lead on this initiative. Should the legislature approve the increase, the City will place this 
question on the November 2015 ballot. 

Six Charter amendments and a general Charter revision question were on the November 
4, 2014 ballot. The following proposals passed: 

o Proposal 1 - Triggers a full review of the charter. A nine-member Charter Review 
Commission will be elected in May 2015. 

o Proposal 2 - Reduces the number of mayoral staff appointments from no more 
than ten to no more than five. 

o Proposal 3 - Adds a Charter amendment to require budgetary best practices. 

Three finalists were selected for the City Administrator position. Background and 
reference checks are being conducted on the preferred candidate now, with a goal to 
bring the person on board in February 2015. 

City officials met last month with the DEQ, and as a result of that meeting, prepared an 
operational plan to reduce the formation of disinfection by-products. They have 
exceeded the standard which is primarily the result of using water from a different 
source, namely the Flint River. This is anticipated to be mitigated once the City begins 
using Lake Huron water from the Karagondi pipeline. A DEQ violation notice will go 
out next week which will require the City to issue a public notice. The violation is 
expected to continue for a while because it takes time to resolve this problem.

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City has contacted the Michigan Health Endowment Fund at MDCH to determine if 
grant funds are available to assist citizens who are unable to pay their water/sewer bills. 
The accumulated deficit for FY 2013 was $12. 9M; the City reduced the deficit by $3.9M 
to $9M in FY 2014 (unaudited). 

A $1.1M State appropriation was received to fund front-line public safety positions for 
FY 2015. 

The Genesee County 911 Consortium approved the City of Flint’s return to the county- 
wide system by July 1, 2015. This will result in approximately $1M in annual savings to 
the City. Currently, the City spends $2.4M annually to subsidize its own 911 operations. 

A comprehensive public safety study, being prepared by ICMA, is due by year end. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Eliminate annual operating/structural deficit, which is projected at $1.7M for FY 2017 
and grows to $1 1.9M by FY 2019 if the City loses the lawsuit over retiree healthcare. 

If the City loses this lawsuit, it will permanently add $5M annually to the cost of retiree 
healthcare. The City’s current budget does not assume this additional $5M potential 
expense.

MERS. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 2015 to $4.3M 
in FY 2019. This resulted from the closing of certain pension plans and the MERS policy 
of accelerating the actuarial required contribution for closed plans.

OPEB plan reform or elimination - $3.2M+ for duration of fiscal emergency, 3) CBA 
changes affecting unused sick and vacation buy-backs, average final compensation, 
resulting in $100K+ in annual savings, 4) health plan changes - $150K annual savings, 
and 5) outsource Building Department - $75K annual savings. 

FY 2013 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $89K. It is anticipated the

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Melvindale 


Recent Developments 

The City requested approval to issue S2.24M in tax anticipation notes, which matures no 
later than September 1, 2015. Treasury approved the borrowing on November 13, 2014. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund deficit for FY 2013 is $1.9M, an increase of $248K from the FY 2012 
deficit. 

The unrestricted annual deficit for the city-owned ice arena in FY 2013 is $1.9M, which 
is approximately $160K more than what the City projected. It continues to negatively 
impact the General Fund. 

The Department issued a conditional approval of the City’s Deficit Elimination Plan. 
The City is required to submit monthly financial reports to demonstrate adherence to the 
plan. 

The City Council approved placing two millage proposals on the November ballot. The 
first was a 2.07 millage levy to pay the debt on the ice arena. This proposal was soundly 
defeated with 66% of the vote. The second proposal was a 7.08 millage levy for 
street/sidewalk repair. This passed with 55% of the vote. 


Taylor 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund has an unrestricted deficit of $2.2M for FY 2013. 

The City made only 47% of its required annual contribution for OPEB. The unfunded 
liability is $232. 7M and continues to grow. 

There are several contingent liabilities that may impact the financial stability of the City, 
including the possible need to subsidize Brownfield Redevelopment Bonds of $14. 2M. 

A 1996 levy to pay a general obligation bond expires in 2015, potentially resulting in a 
$6.2M drain per year on the General Fund during FY 2016 and FY 2017. 

City of Wayne 

Recent Developments 

Citizens renewed a 1 mill levy for police and fire on November 4, 2014. The City of 
Westland has officially ended discussions to form a fire authority between the Cities of 
Westland, Wayne, and Inkster. Executive-level instability in the City of Wayne was 
stated as the primary reason for this decision. 



Page 10 


Significant Actions/Issues 

Projected General Fund deficits for FY 2014 and beyond. 

The City is discussing a May 2015 ballot proposal that would seek voter approval for 
additional millage. 

The positions of Finance Director, Personnel Director, Chief of Police, and Parks and 
Recreation Director are currently vacant. 

David Murphy was appointed Interim City Manager on October 7, 2014. 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

Treasury staff met with the County Executive Transition Team to have a general 
discussion regarding what the team sees as critical issues. 

The Finance Director has indicated that short-term borrowing may not be necessary for 
FY 2015. However, the most recent cash flow statement does not support this 
conclusion. 

Cash reserves reached its lowest point in August 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $73M (average balance is $170M). This includes proceeds from a short 
term borrowing of $75M. 

In a monthly status letter from the Director of Labor Relations, the Director continues to 
indicate that negotiations with all bargaining units have stalled. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Warren Evans was elected as Wayne County Executive on November 4, 2014. Mr. Evans 
replaces Robert Ficano. 

The Finance Director anticipates the accumulated deficit for FY 2014, will be 
approximately $60M. The reduction from $159M is mainly due to the transfer of funds 
from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to the General Fund. 

The preliminary results of the County’s actuarial report indicate a drop in OPEB liability 
of approximately $409M. This reduction is a result of the City choosing less expensive 
plans and implementing cost sharing. The participants are paying a larger share of the 
cost. This does not include any savings opportunity resulting from a proposed change to 
retiree healthcare. 

The County is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The County currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The County submitted a revised Deficit Elimination Plan (DEP), approved by the County 
Commission, which removes the changes to retiree healthcare. The loss of the $9.2M in 
savings will be offset by the $10M anticipated increase in revenue sharing. The County 
Treasurer agreed to transfer $150M from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund to the 
General Fund. Of that $150M, $82M has already been transferred and applied to the 
accumulated deficit, and $44M has been applied to the operating/structural deficit in 
accordance with the DEP. The additional $24M, which was not part of the DEP, will be 
used to help reduce the accumulated deficit. 

Approval of the County’s DEP is on hold until the new Wayne County Executive takes 
office. The County will be required to submit an updated DEP to include the unaudited 
numbers for FY 2014.

Subject: Head's up 


We are working right now on a Wayne County Consent Agreement that is a little different than other ones 
we've done. Evans is committed toward major reductions in their structure and we're working to get him 
there. I doubt they can reach some of the targets they are after but they have to start somewhere. His 
press release was pretty strong and his conversations with the unions pretty negative. He's pretty far 
out on a limb on his plan. It's not exactly what we would want but we're getting there. Nick feels that 
we can go with their plan unless after study (we just got it today) there's a flaw we didn't 

We're ready to move ahead declaring tomorrow that Flint is ready to take its city under its own control 
and I personally would like to congratulate you on the leadership that achieved this goal. Outside of 
the issues over the water we feel pretty confident going forward. The water issue continues to be a 
danger flag. 

We're moving ahead with the Highland Park schools change and are hoping that the charter operator will 
maintain a K-8 but they want extra money from us to do so. It may be that we have to do the whole 
district population, which will be a lot more controversial.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

After conducting preliminary interviews for the City Administrator position, a request 
was made by the Emergency Manager to identify additional qualified candidates. 

A fire union collective bargaining agreement was approved on February 6, 2015. 
Changes to overtime and paid leave will yield an estimated cost savings of $500K 
annually. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal that was on 
the May ballot by a margin of 47% to 53%. Had it been approved it would have raised 
an additional 6 mils, or $3M annually to fund fire and police pension and healthcare 
costs. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes will be implemented on July 1, 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K annually. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. Salient 
increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $143. 5K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through updated technology. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Police collective bargaining agreements must be finalized.

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Forron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March 2015 for review. Upon its review and determination that the Plan was based on 
sound assumptions and met all of the requirements under statute, the FRC approved the 
Plan on April 20, 2015. The city’s Plan encompassed the second year (FY16) of 
Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used this as its base year with no 
changes, plus three years (FY17, FY18, and FY19). 

The city’s CFO John Hill hosted a “mini” revenue estimating conference on May 14, 
2015, to review revenue estimates approved in February 2015 at the statutorily required 
Revenue Estimating Conference. After reviewing the city’s revenue trends for income 
tax, state revenue sharing, wagering taxes, property taxes, utility users tax and all other 
general fund revenues, among other major fund accounts, and discussing economic 
trends since February, the city elected to maintain revenue estimates agreed upon at the 
February 2015 Revenue Estimating Conference. 

In addition to the recent hire of Ron Rose for the position of Executive Director for the 
Office of the FRC, Treasury has hired Steven Watson, who is currently with the State of 
New Jersey Office of Budget and Management, to fill the Administrative Manager 
position. Mr. Watson is expected to start on May 26, 2015. Treasury does not expect to 
hire any additional staff beyond an executive administrative assistant. 

The most intense work that the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restructuring initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

The next FRC meeting is scheduled for May 18, 2015, and the Commission will be asked 
to approve various contracts and leases related to the Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department transaction. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The RTAB approved City Council’s appointment of the city’s Finance Director as 
Interim City Administrator, effective March 12, 2015. A professional search firm has 
been hired to help find City Administrator candidates. Treasury will be participating with 
City Council in the selection process. 

The city was expecting to issue a bond tender offer beginning in March but was delayed 
due to the uncertainty around the City Administrator position. Completion of the bond 



Page 3 


tender process is now projected to be June 2015. 

In April, the RTAB approved the creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator 
position to assist in overseeing city operations until the bond tender and City Hall 
projects are completed. Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, 
was appointed to this position. 

The Michigan Municipal League and Plante Moran were retained by the city to conduct 
salary and classification studies of all department head and key manager positions within 
the city. The city has not established a timeline for this project at this time. 

The city remains without a Director of Public Services after the leading candidate for the 
position rejected the city’s offer of employment. A department foreman is serving as 
interim while the city evaluates how to fill this position. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

City Hall will be relocating to a temporary facility in May 2015. The present facility is in 
poor condition and beyond repair. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The city’s Finance Director has accepted a position as Finance Director in the City of 
Flint. Her last date of employment is June 5, 2015. 

The city’s Deputy Finance Director, multiple public safety officers, and two public works 
department employees have resigned due to other employment opportunities. 

On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $910K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
water system through water main replacements and fire hydrant repairs, and to complete 
a property reappraisal which will provide updated and accurate assessing records. 
Additionally, the city will provide community enhancement through blight management 
and sidewalk replacement. 

FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. 



Page 4 


The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months) 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. 

The RTAB has recommended that the State Treasurer amend the final EM order to 
provide RTAB oversight for all hiring and terminations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $350K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through improved street lighting. 

The City Council cancelled the contracted City Administrator search with the Michigan 
Municipal Feague (MMF) and appointed Wayne O’Neal as full-time City Administrator. 
On February 10, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s resolution appointing Mr. O’Neal. 
The RTAB’s Annual Evaluation for the Governor was not favorable, citing a lack of 
local financial literacy, political infighting, and an inability to develop a balanced multi- 
year budget. For these reasons, the removal of RTAB oversight cannot be recommended 
at this time. 

The city continues to have trouble attracting qualified candidates, and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

The city signed a contract with UHY to provide part-time financial services until a 
permanent solution can be found. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System (MERS) pension contributions are anticipated to 
increase from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 because of accelerated funding for 
closed plans. 

The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griffe a, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

A clerical error by the Flint City Clerk’s Office gave candidates the wrong cutoff 
deadline to file nominating petitions, April 28 instead of April 21. Consequently, in the 
Mayor’s race, Mayor Dayne Walling, Councilman Wantwaz Davis, and Dr. Karen 
Weaver will all be left off the August Primary ballot and will have to run as write-in 
candidates in November. Councilman Eric Mays did not submit the required number of 
signatures and will likewise be left off the ballot for Mayor and will also have to run as a 
write-in candidate. Councilman Herbert Winfrey will be on the ballot and is unopposed 
for the Sixth Ward seat on the City Council. There were four candidates who filed 
petitions for the Third Ward City Council seat. Fegislators will be asked to provide a 
statutory fix to allow names on the ballot. If this isn’t successful, all will be forced to run 
as write-in candidates in the General Election. 

Jodi Fundquist has accepted the employment offer as CFO. Her start date is to be 
determined subject to RTAB approval. 

On April 29, 2015 the city exited emergency manager status and an RTAB was 
appointed. The first RTAB meeting will be held on June 10, 2015.

On April 29, 2015, the Emergency Loan Financial Assistance Board approved a $7M 
Emergency Loan that will eliminate the city’s remaining deficit when combined with the 
FY surplus of $20M. 

EM Gerry Ambrose issued an EM Order on March 19, 2015 that restructured the State 
Revolving Fund loans and provides approximately $2.2M, allowing the city to invest in 
capital improvements to the water system. 

EM Gerry Ambrose implemented new Budget Purchasing Ordinances and a Fund 
Balance Policy during April 2015. 

The Executive Director of the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with state statute, State Tax 
Commission rules, and implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the city 
shall implement a full appraisal within a time frame agreed with the State Tax 
Commission. 

The City of Flint continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of March 
are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe water. 
However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all testing 
sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant by the 
MDEQ. Monthly testing remains ongoing and is being conducted by several parties. 

The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. The city is installing a $1.5M granulated active- 
charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be completed in mid- 
July. 

In April, EM Gerry Ambrose issued two EM Orders that adopted a two-year budget for 
FY 17 and FY 18 and outlined the relationship between the Administrator, Mayor, and 
City Council. 

On April 13, 2015, EM Order 4 was issued that restored the pay of the Mayor and City 
Council members. 

The City Council approved a memorandum of understanding that will consolidate the 
67 lh District Court with the 68th District Court in January 2016. The city has estimated 
that the consolidation will save the city $8M over a ten year period. 

The Michigan Municipal League is recruiting qualified candidates to fill the open Human 
Relations Director, Finance Director, and City Treasurer positions. 

Voters elected John Cherry, Charles Metcalf, Barry Williams, Cleora Magee, Jim 
Richardson, Brian Larkin, Victoria McKenze, Marsha Wesley, and Heidi Phaneuf to 
serve on the Charter Commission. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
city’s water system through improved waste management, leak detection, and pipe 
assessments. Pre-planning for implementation of these activities is underway. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume this additional $5M to $6M annual expense, which will grow at a rate equal to 
the general rise in healthcare costs.

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The Police Chief resigned on March 11, 2015. Lieutenant Ann Moise was appointed 
Acting Police Chief. 

Per the 2014 audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance is $2.8M out of a total 
budget of $16. 2M. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $622K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a 
property reappraisal which will provide updated and accurate assessing records, upgrade 
City Hall security, and enhance public safety through improved street lighting. 

A complaint was filed in the federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to 
healthcare benefits in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently 
unknown. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M in 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. These increases were included in EM Square’s two-year budget. The 
Segal Group has been hired to provide the city with recommendations on funding its 
pension obligations. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

On April 22, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. This ordinance amendment was adopted by the City Council at its April 9, 
2015 meeting with no prior announcement or analysis of the issue. No actuarial study 
was conducted for this change, but the best available estimates indicated the impact to the 
city’s pension system could be approximately $9M-$13M per year. The Mayor, City 
Administrator, and Finance Director are opposed to this amendment. 

On April 29, 2015, the City Administrator informed Treasury that the City Council is 
considering adopting an amendment to the city’s retirement ordinance that would permit 
the pension system to absorb $659,000 in COLA overpayments that were made to city 
retirees. Such an action is permissible under new rules adopted by the Internal Revenue 
Service. The City Council may consider this ordinance amendment at a future Council 
meeting. The RTAB postponed action on this issue until City Council takes action. 
Treasury is monitoring this situation. 

Significant Actions/Issues

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $125K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used for community 
enhancement through blight management. 

The City Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 45% to 55% margin. 

In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. A suitable candidate was not found through a Michigan Municipal 
League (MML) search. TJA Staffing and Associates has been hired to recruit a Deputy 
Mayor as part of the transition back to Home Rule. 

Per the audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance for FY 14 is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the city’s condemnation 
lawsuit involving the Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for 
the lien placed on the property. The city is preparing an appeal of the decision to the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge 
Avem Cohn. The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree 
healthcare and replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement 
System (GERS) Pension Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring 
options to use the overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. 

On March 17, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial a 
previous lower court dismissal of a 2013 lawsuit which challenged the EM ordered 
nonpayment of $3.9M into a VEBA trust for the fiscal year ending 2012. This appellate 
order is not a judgment against the city; rather it allows the previously dismissed lawsuit 
to proceed. The actual liability of the city will be determined either by a future settlement 
or by a final determination of the Oakland County Circuit Court. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Tnkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

On May 14, 2015, the City Council agreed to settle the Dent lawsuit regarding police 
misconduct for $1.37M. The cost of the settlement will be placed on the tax roll by a 
judgement levy. 

On April 20, 2015, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault 
and mistreatment of a prisoner (Richard Dent) against William Melendez, former Inkster 
police officer. 

In the wake of a violent interaction between Inkster police and a suspect, Inkster Police 
Chief Vicki Yost announced her resignation on April 22, 2015. The city hired a search 
firm to recruit qualified candidates to fill the Police Chief position, which is expected to 
be filled by the end of June. 

On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

Significant Actions/Issues 


Page 


On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $855K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a 
property reappraisal to provide updated and accurate assessing records, enhance the water 
system through fire hydrant repairs, and enhancing public safety through the creation of a 
multi-jurisdictional narcotics team, police officer training, deployment of an additional 
police officer, providing a backup power source, and updating technology. 

The FY 14 General Fund accumulated deficit per the most recent audit is $767K out of a 
total budget of $1 1M. 


River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

A fire union collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was approved on March 10, 2015, 
resulting in a reduction in health care costs. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $592K through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance 
public safety through improved street lighting, along with infrastructure replacements to 
City Hall. 

General fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 14 and the accumulated 
fund balance was $1.9M. 

A reduction in healthcare benefits for active employees and retirees was implemented on 
November 1, 2014. The city estimates an annual savings of $400K, which includes 
savings expected under the approved fire union CBA. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that the Township Supervisor is regularly approving 
overtime for employees. Overtime is not included in the 2015 budget, and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to any overtime expenditures. This is 
another example of the township’s inability to comply with the terms of the Consent 
Agreement. Treasury is working with Robert Burgess on a response to this development. 
On April 7, 2015, Oakland County notified the township that they rejected the proposed 
ballot language for 4 l A mils for general operations because the township’s proposed 
language did not conform to guidelines. The township adopted newly proposed ballot 
language on April 23, 2015. This language has been resubmitted to Oakland County. 

An Order was issued by Mr. Burgess on May 9, 2015 to contract for financial consulting 
services with the Rehmann Group that will assist the township in preparing records for its 
annual audit and budget amendments. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 9 


On February 3, 2015, the township was awarded $274K through the Financially 
Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to 
enhance public safety through improved street lighting and increased police services. 195 
street lights would be converted to LEDs; it is anticipated that work will be completed by 
August 2015. 

The Michigan State Police (MSP) continues to provide police services to the township. 
The Department of Treasury and the MSP continue to work towards an alternative to 
MSP services. A proposal from the City of Hazel Park is not financially feasible due to 
expense and the city’s unwillingness to amend the proposal to better accommodate the 
township’s ability to pay. Mr. Burgess has met with the City of Detroit to determine if 
the city is interested in submitting a proposal to provide police services to the township. 
The State Treasurer approved the township’s 2015 budget on December 16, 2014, with 
the requirement that the township work with Treasury to implement additional budget 
amendments to improve its overall effectiveness. No additional actions have occurred to 
implement these additional budget amendments and Mr. Burgess is questioning the 
ability of the township’s newly hired financial analyst to provide service to the township. 
The township has paid its aging accounts payable that was in excess of $200K. Mr. 
Burgess has requested the Township Board adopt budget amendments to the 2015 budget 
totaling $220K to accommodate these unanticipated expenditures. The Township Board 
has refused to adopt the requested amendments. Treasury is working with the CAC 
Burgess on a response to this issue. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
PA 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

Treasury staff is continuing to monitor the city’s progress or lack thereof, in complying 
with the terms of the Loan Agreement dated September 23, 2014. There are concerns 
about their ability to successfully restructure their finances and they have failed to 
implement the health insurance benefit cost reductions as planned in FY 15. In addition, 
failure to reach an agreement with DWSD resulted in a $20M judgement levy against the 
city. Finally, there have been problems in implementing the regular billing of water and 
sewer service to its customers and the calculation and collection of past due amounts 
owed to the city, since regular billing ceased in mid-2012. 

On April 24, 2015, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) was granted a 
judgment levy to collect $20M for sewer service that is currently owed to DWSD. 

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. 

A Wayne County Circuit Judge issued a temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 
blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water service to the City of Highland Park. In 
addition, the judge also set aside the $20M judgment against the City of Highland Park 
for failure to pay DWSD for water and sewer services. The judge has set a conference 
hearing on this matter for June 4, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 10 


On February 3, 2015, the city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed 
Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the 
city’s water system through meter replacement, leak detection, and system repairs. 

Huron Consulting was retained to prepare a request for proposal to solicit firms to 
operate and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan of 
Adjustment. The city received one proposal from Wade Trim by the submission deadline 
of May 4, 2015. This proposal is under review by the City and Treasury. 

The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20.7M owed to the DWSD, $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. 

Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014: 

o The city must make major reductions to retiree healthcare benefit costs, 
o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $12M plus restructuring of $4.8M existing 
loans will be requested by the city to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization Bonds, 
$5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund Bonds. 
The status of this request will be reviewed in the context of benchmarks the city 
committed to in their last emergency loan in September 2014. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

The Recovery Plan has been released to the public and Treasury has begun an analysis of 
the plan. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Cash reserves reached its lowest point in February 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $22M. The August 2014 cash balance was approximately $150M. This 
number includes proceeds from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

The County’s annual structural general fund deficit is approximately $50M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures. The Plan participants are now paying a larger share of the cost. This does not 
include any saving opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 
The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

o Housing Assistance: Providing 250 housing units in the communities 
with the most need and is on track to provide a total of 500 units in 
three years. 

o Smart 911 Rollout: Smart 911, which allows callers to provide 
dispatchers with more information about their situation, has been 
deployed in 14 counties and one city. 

Details: 110,000 newborns tested for severe disorders 

o Newborn Screening tested more than 110,000 newborns, providing early 
diagnosis for more than 50 rare, severe disorders, 
o The Michigan Newborn Screening Program (DHHS) celebrated its 50 th 
anniversary in 2015. 

Detroit blight removal/demolition costs update: 

Background 


■ As a first-of-its-kind national pilot, in 2013, MSHDA built Michigan's Hardest Hit 
Fund demolition program in the best, most efficient way possible at the time 

■ It was designed as a true federal, state, city partnership 

■ According to a review by the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA had outlined proper oversight 
and guidelines in its blight program manual for blight partners: 

o It contained everything from strategic plan submission requirements to 
partner participation agreements to a spending timeline, funding schedule, 
invoicing, performance reporting and much more. 

■ However, it contained no requirements for MSHDA to monitor either bid 
contracting or change orders among blight partners and Treasury 

■ MSHDA saw no need to add an extra layer of restriction above and beyond what 
was federally required

Talking points: 

• Protecting the health and safety of our residents in Flint and across Michigan is always our top priority. 

o All Michigan residents need access to safe, clean water 

• That's why today, in consultation with health and water experts in our state agencies, I'm advocating 
reconnecting the Flint drinking water with the Great Lakes Water Authority. 

• I'm recommending to my partners in the Legislature that the state government provide $6 million of the needed 
$12 million to reconnect with authority. 

o The Flint city government has agreed to cover $2 million of this cost, and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation is generously offered to donate $4 million. 

o The Michigan Department of FHealth and Fluman Services and the Department of Environmental Quality 
today also is committing an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water. 

• What you are seeing here today is a community coming together to work toward solving a problem. 

o I appreciate the assistance of Mayor Walling, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

o This is a collaborative approach, and I appreciate that community organizations including the United 
Way and come forward to assist. 




Today's announcement in an important step as we move forward together, 
o But it is not our first step, nor will it be our last. 



• This announcement builds on work we've already set in place. 

• That includes $4.2 million in state grants and loan restructuring to help identify and fix 
infrastructure problems. 

• State agencies have been working closely with Flint leaders and the community for more 
than a year. 

There will be more to do. 

o Flint has an aging water infrastructure system with challenges that we - together - will continue to 
address. 

We will continue to test Flint schools for lead levels in drinking water, 
o Schools across the state might also have questions. 

o The Department of Environmental Quality will work with districts across the state to provide testing. 

• Districts can send water samples and paperwork and the nominal charge. (It costs $26 per 
sample). 


The steps outlined in the comprehensive action plan are still in effect. 



FAQs for Media Q&As 


Switch to Great Lakes Water Authority 

What finally pushed the state to this decision? 

This was the City's request, and the Governor supports it, based on several key factors: 

In the near term, DWSD water will be easier to manage. It comes from a more stable source than the river, it is fully 
optimized for corrosion control, and it is clear that residents of Flint have more confidence in this water source. 

Will this solve Flint's water crisis? 

In combination with the other short term, intermediate term and long-term steps outlined last week, this move 
represents a big step forward. Flint still has serious system maintenance challenges it must address. 

If you're saying residents will still have lead because of their plumbing, does that mean every other city in this state 
has a lead problem? 

Many areas of the state have lead in their infrastructure mix. 

Where's the state getting the money to fund this? 

We have submitted a formal request to lawmakers via the appropriations process. 

Where's the city getting the money to fund this? 

The city is contributing all it can, and is getting assistance for its match from the Mott Foundation. 

How long will the switch take? 

The switch will be completed by the City and Great lakes Water Authority, but our understanding is that it can be 
accomplished in the very near term once the arrangements are complete. 

How long will it take before Detroit's corrosion controls provide protection for Flint? 

It will take some time for the corrosion control additives to build on pipe walls throughout the system. Estimates vary. 
The state can assure we will commence monitoring of the system early 2016 and report results as we get them to keep 
the community updated. 

Why do residents still need to use filters and bottled water? 

The filters and bottled water are responsible precautions for any resident concerned about lead exposure. 

Do the filters actually work? We've been hearing they don't protect for lead. 

Yes, the filters work. They are all certified for lead removal by the National Sanitation Foundation. 

The filters are only good for 100 gallons. What happens when they are used up? 

They will need to be replaced. And residents can get a new filter. 

What about restaurants? 

What's going to be done about lead service lines? 

Long term, this is the only permanent solution to lead exposure. The state has committed to helping the city accomplish 
this goal long term. 




Do you wish you'd made this switch sooner? 

We support the City's decision. We can't look backward. We feel the state has responded quickly and effectively as 
information has surfaced, been investigated and verified. While the City of Flint is, right now, in compliance with the 
federal Lead and 

Copper Rule, we recognize there is a disparity between surveillance testing and other testing happening in the 
community that we need to better understand and we are working on developing our knowledge. 

Schools testing 

What do these results say? 

The results say we need to further investigate Flint schools and help the schools find clearer causes for some the results 
we got. 

Any theories about what's going on? 

It is possible there are specific points in the plumbing that have lead components which need to be replaced, but we 
can't say anything definitively until we perform an investigation at each school. 

Do the schools have lead service lines? If not, why are they getting such high results? 

The schools we tested initially do not have lead service lines. There are a few possible reasons why lead is being 
detected at specific points in the buildings and not others. When we know things definitively, we will make the 
information public. 

How long do the schools have to stay on bottled water? Just until the switch to Detroit, or longer term? 

We are encouraging the schools to continue their current protective measures as a precaution until we can get into the 
buildings and get more answers. 

Why did you only test 13 schools? 

That was what the Flint Public Schools requested. 

What happens to other schools? 

We will test all the schools in Flint if they request it. 

What about the schools that can't afford to update their entire plumbing systems? 

This is why we are having plumbing assessments completed. There is no way to know yet what each building will 
require. 

How confident are you in your testing? You've got results all over the map. 

We are confident that our testing meets the requirements for the federal Lead and Copper Rule, which is surveillance 
monitoring. The bigger question is whether surveillance monitoring meets the public health protection standards that 
Lead Exposure Testing methods do. The EPA is working on that question now, and we are engaged in that dialogue. 

What do you mean by "health exposure testing"? What are you doing next? 


The 90 th percentile of your results is still below 15 ppb. Does that make you more or less confident in your testing and 
in your protocols? 



It makes us confident that the testing protocol delivers consistent results. But again, it does raise questions about 
whether this testing method shows what people think it does or what they really want to know, which is actual lead 
exposure from lead plumbing in a home. 

Any idea how long kids have been exposed to lead? Was it before the move to the Flint River? 

That is possible. We don't know. 

How does the state bring this new information into the broader picture of kids' lead exposure across the state? 



Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points for Director Lyon and Dr. Wells 


Water Filters 

• Our first action item is to work closely with our public and private partners to provide water filters to Flint 
residents and MDHHS clients. 

• To meet this priority, the governor identified one million dollars in state funding to purchase water filters for 
Flint residents. 

• The Brita SAFF-100 filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the NSF/ANSI 53 standards 
for drinking water treatment units. 

• The Brita faucet filtration system we are distributing are National Sanitation Foundation certified to reduce lead 
in drinking water. 

• Free water filters are available to current Michigan Department of Health and Human Services clients and Flint 
residents who are on the Flint water system at four locations: 

o Flint residents who are not current MDHHS clients should visit one of two Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices to obtain a filter. 

■ at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint 

o Current MDHHS clients in the city of Flint should visit their local MDHHS office 

■ At 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 

• Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

• Extended hours are being offered at the Lippincott facility only, and will run until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, 
and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The other three locations will maintain 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. operating hours, 
Monday through Friday, for filter pick up. 

• Given the questions and concerns regarding the change in water source in Flint, MDHHS authorized the use of 
emergency services funding to provide water filters for MDHHS clients receiving assistance in the city of Flint. 

• This funding will support active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food Assistance Program (FAP), Child 
Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance (SDA), State Disability Assistance (SDA), or Social 
Security Insurance (SSI) recipients so that they can obtain filters that are National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) 
certified to remove lead and ANSI Standard 53. 

• MDHHS currently serves approximately 25,000 households in Flint. 


School Testing and Results 

• The state today also released the first results from its free lead screening program in schools. 

• Out of 13 buildings tested, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 
parts per billion. 

• However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and MDHHS toxicologists will work with DEO. to conduct 
further testing. 

• Schools on the Flint water system should continue using filtered or bottled water to protect against potential 
lead exposure. 

Background Information 

• Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in Flint have followed an expected 
seasonal trend; due to small numbers further analysis was initiated. 




• While this analysis of blood lead levels in Flint as a whole remains true, after a comprehensive and detailed 
review down to the zip code level, we have found that the state analysis is consistent with that presented by 
Hurley. 

• Director Lyon is working closely with DEQ and the administration to take active steps to reduce all potential lead 
exposures in Flint, and across the state. 

• Our Chief Medical Executive has been in communication with the lead investigator at Hurley Children's Hospital, 
and we continue to work with Hurley, the city of Flint, local and state leaders to verify and analyze data trends. 

• Zip code-level data does show that there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in specific 
communities. 

o This does not conclusively mean that the water source change is the sole cause of the increase, but data 
does show an association. 

o There is an increased proportion of children with elevated Blood Levels (ELBs) in several zip codes, 
particularly 03 and 04. These appear to have increased over the last 1.5 years. 

o Lead exposure can occur from a number of different sources (such as paint, gasoline, solder, and 
consumer products) and through different pathways (such as air, food, water, dust, and soil). 

o Although there are several exposure sources, lead-based paint is still the most widespread and 
dangerous high-dose source of lead exposure for young children in the US and Michigan. 

• We reviewed MDHHS statewide data using the same methodology used by Hurley, looking at our numbers by 
zip code and age ranges, and filtering out non-Flint children. 

• Routine surveillance of blood lead levels does not analyze data down to the zip code level. Detailed analysis like 
this occurs when there is reason to focus in on precise locations or populations. 

• MDHHS is working closely with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Hurley Children's Hospital, 
the Genesee County Health Department, and community organizations to initiate further action steps. 

• We understand that cost may be a barrier to following the recommendations for drinking water, which is why 
NSF certified filters are being distributed to residents on the Flint water system free of charge. 

• MDHHS is recommending that residents follow the Public Health Advisory issued by the Genesee County Health 
Department, as well as take further steps to reduce exposures to all forms of lead in and around their homes. 


MDHHS Stats and Facts 

• 'High Risk' Zip codes (48503 and 48504) 

o Blood lead level rates among children under six years of age in the high risk zip codes (48503, 48504) 
were 2.7 times higher than the rest of Genesee County before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o After the switch to Flint River Water, rates in the high risk Zip codes were 3.2 times that of the rest of 
Genesee County. 

• Other Zip codes in Flint 

o Rates of elevated blood lead levels among children under six years of age in other parts of the city of 
Flint were 2 times that of the rest of Genesee County before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o The magnitude of the elevated rate remained roughly the same during the period after the water source 
switch. 

• Lead abatement through MDHHS was federally funded up until FY14 when Michigan began providing additional 
funds to abate homes. 

• In FY14, $1.25M General Fund was added. In FY15, General Fund was bumped up to $1.75M and FY16, General 
Fund remains at $1.75M. 



Reducing and Removing Lead Exposure 


• In housing built before 1978, it can be assumed that the paint has lead unless tests show otherwise. 

• Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint. 

• Children and pregnant women should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. 
They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is 
completed. 

• Create barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed, you 
should clean and isolate all sources of lead. 

o Close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply 
temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, to cover holes in walls or to block children's 
access to other sources of lead. 

• Regularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or 
exterior soil. Both are known lead sources. 

• Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, 
you should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. 

o Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, 
windows should be shut to prevent abrasion of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash. 

• Take off shoes when entering the house to prevent bringing lead-contaminated soil in from outside. 

• Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Plant grass on areas of bare 
soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. 

o Until the bare soil is covered, move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the 

house. If you have a sandbox, cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. 
That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste. 

• Avoid using makeup, containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or liquids that are not shown to 
be lead free. 

• Remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children. 

• Use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Hot water is more likely to 
contain higher levels of lead. Most of the lead in household water usually comes from the plumbing in your 
house, not from the local water supply. 

• Shower and change clothes after finishing a task that involves working with lead-based products such as stained 
glass, making bullets, or using a firing range. 


WIC Children 

• There are 855 infants participating in WIC in Flint. 

• We are working with partners at the United Way to ensure that WIC families have access to water filters and 
bottled water. 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official source of unsanitary water 
supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to-feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if 
they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water. 



Flint water action plan - next steps 
Communications & Outreach Plan 


Situation overview: 

Water and concerns about lead levels in the city of Flint have been escalating since the city moved to the Flint River as 
its source of water after switching from DWSD in the spring of 2014 with local plans to move to a new water authority - 
the Karegnondi Water Authority or KWA - slated to be online in June 2016. Numerous tests have shown the water 
overall to be safe with non-detect lead levels when leaving Flint water treatment plan and below widely recognized 
federal action levels (15 ppb) in most surveillance monitoring. However, like many communities across the state and 
country, Flint's infrastructure is aging and hasn't been updated in decades, facing outdated lead service connections and 
lead pipes in individual homes. Some water tests have indicated definite elevated lead levels within some homes, 
neighborhoods and zip codes, with some children in those same areas also experiencing elevated lead levels, causing 
great concern for all parties. 

Race, poverty and local governance (with city's history of emergency managers) have all been railed as issues or 
allegations, adding to the challenges. 

Given all factors involved, it has been deemed prudent and best for public health and restoring confidence in water 
system to temporarily switch back to Detroit water, now governed by an entity called the Great Lakes Water Authority, 
as the city's water source until the new KWA is completed. A specie:! technical advisory committee comprised of public 
health and drinking water experts has concurred and recommended such a path. The cost to do so is estimated at about 
$12M over nine months. The state is proposing to cover about half of the cost with the city ($2M) and community 
organizations (C.S. Mott Foundation at $4M) pledging to cover the balance. 

Goals/obiectives: 

• Ensure governor and state focus is on protecting public health and ensuring safe, accessible drinking water and all 
the action steps that are being taken to help ensure those two priorities. 

• Minimize and diffuse finger pointing and tension between all stakeholders. 

• Effective, concise communication that makes it clear for both residents and schools what next steps are and that 
state is committed to doing everything it can to help address situation in partnership and collaboration with city and 
community leaders. 

• Restore confidence in Flint water. 

• Convey shared responsibility to address.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure 
monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer.

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from 
large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, 
the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using 
phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced.

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four 
locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents 
who have questions about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will 
be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. on Saturday. 


Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap 
and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 1 5 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden: 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water In one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich., have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking ’water. 
For this reason, ! am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 
particularly for young children. 


Although the city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have 
conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 
level, there are significant questions about the efficacy of their testing. In fact, Dr. Marc Edwards 
of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water In Flint is unsafe to drink. 



Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention.

Ms. Gina McCarthy 

Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency 
1 101 A 

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, M.W. 

Washington, D.C. 20460 


Dear Administrator McCarthy: 

My office has reached out to both the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations 
at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
to determine if there are any statutory limitations on states to forgive the principal on loans made 
through the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SDWSRF) program. After talking to 
both of these offices, there seems to he a difference in legal opinion between the two 
interpretations as to whether forgiveness of principal is statutorily allowed, and I am requesting 
further clarification. 

The City of Flint, Mich,, located in my district, continues to endure prolonged and severe 
financial stress due to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs, resulting in population loss 
and an erosion of its tax base. In an effort, to improve the city’s financial stability, Flint decided 
to end its 50-plus~year affiliation with the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department in April 
of 2013. Instead, Flint would become a partner in the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to 
bring raw water from Lake Huron to the city. 

The water contract between the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department and Flint was 
terminated in May of 2G14,The KWA, however, will not be able to provide water to the city until 
its pipeline from Flint to Lake Huron is completed at the end of 2016. To fill the gap in service 
until the KWA is completed, Flint has turned to the Flint River as its current source for raw 
water. The Flint River has proven to have an inconsistent quality because of high levels of 
organic matter, Flint water officials have used high levels of trihaiomethanes to treat the 
occasional elevated levels of organic matter in tire water. On December 16, 2014, the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality cited the city for being in violation of water standards 
determined by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) due to high levels of trihaiomethanes. In 
accordance with the SDWA, a cautionary notice about the citation was subsequently sent to 



Since its citation, Flint has engaged local and state leaders to find a solution for the poor quality 
of the water. On February 3, 2015, the state gave the city close to $2 million to hire consultants 
to assess the condition and find leaks in the water infrastructure system. While this binding is a 
step in the fight direction, it is not nearly enough to significantly improve the water quality. 

This background on Flint’s water situation is to point out that the SDWA is intended to improve 
drinking water in America’s cities, such as Flint, by creating water quality standards and funding 
the SDWSRF to invest in water infrastructure. In addition to the high levels of trihalomethanes, 
the poor condition of water infrastructure in Flint, regardless of the water’s source, contributes to 
discolored and poor tasting water. Furthermore, Flint currently suffers an over 35 percent loss 
ratio of water between the treatment plant and the end user. In the past, Flint has benefited from 
the SDWSRF and currently has close to $22 million in outstanding loans from it that the city has 
used to repair the water system. The financial stress of making payments on these loans, 
however, has prevented the city from making the necessary ongoing investments to its water 
infrastructure. 

To decrease the burden of these loans, on January 18, 201 5, Flint requested that the state of 
Michigan, as the responsible party in appropriating funds from the SDWSRF to local 
governments, forgive part of the principal The state responded that forgiving the principal is not 
an option as the state does not have the authority to do so. 

In response to the state’s reply, on February 10, 2015, my staff reached out to the Office of 
Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at the ERA to ask if they were aware of any 
statutory language that prevents principal forgiveness of loans made under the SDWSRF. On 
February 25, 2015, the EFA responded that they “could find ... no provision that would allow a 
state to [forgive an existing loan made from a Safe Drinking Water Act state revolving fund],” 

On February' 23, 2015, my staff also reached out to the CRS for their legal opinion on this 
matter. Although they could not find any precedent for doing so, the CRS did find two instances 
in statute that, in their opinion, allows states to forgive the principal on loans made through the 
SDWSRF. 

First, SDWA sec, 1452(4X1)? 42 USC 30Oj-l 2(d)(1), states ™ “Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, in any case in which the State makes a loan pursuant to subsection 
(a)(2) of this section to a disadvantaged community ,, , , the State may provide additional 
subsidization (including forgiveness of principal).” 

Second, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. Law 113*235, 
states on page 296 ~ “Provided further, [t]hat not less than 20 percent hut not more than 30 
percent of the funds made available under this title to each State for Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund capitalization grants shall be used by the State to provide additional subsidy to 
eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or 
any combination of these), and shall be so used by the State only where such funds are provided 
as initial financing for an eligible recipient or to buy, refinance, or restructure foe debt 
obligations of eligible recipients only where such debt was incurred on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act; . . . T 



The difference in opinion between EPA and CRS has created ambiguity for the affected parties. 
The ability of states to forgive portions of the principal on loans made through the SDWSRF 
could have a significant impact on the financial state of Flint and many other distressed 
municipalities across the county. I would appreciate clarification from you on what, according to 
EPA’s interpretation of the law, statutoril y prevents states from forgiving the principal on loans 
made under the SDWSRF. 


Due to critical nature of the water quality in Flint and the impact that loan forgiveness could 
have on improving the quality of the water, I ask for your prompt attention to this matter. 


Sincerely, 



Dan Kildee

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a previous 
35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This injunction also 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund, prevents the 
city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from disconnecting water service for 
nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction could potentially cost the General 
Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have not been successful. Most recently, 
Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a class action. 

As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
$1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed an 
appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal because 
the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back to Genesee 
County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is discussing the need 
for additional legal representation with the city. 




6 


Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’ s water system after a study 
by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard testing 
shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be adding a 
corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead leaching into 
the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality testing to 
residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case (Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 0.6 
mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must maintain 
adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax Commission Rules, 
and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the city shall implement 
a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the State Tax Commission. The 
city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

- The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation of 
the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the installation 
of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance with the 
federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a 
leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is approximately 1/3 
complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per year. 
On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department to 
the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a hiring 
process. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’ s two-year budget does not assume 
an additional $5M to $6M annual expense.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The sampling protocol was revised to address comments received on October 22 
from EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force. 

• Staff assisted DLARA in conducting a plumbing assessment at Freeman 
Elementary School. Actions were taken to prepare for sampling to be conducted 
on Saturday, October 24. 

• The information requested by the DEQ was not received on October 23 from 
Flint’s consultant, Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN); thus, the 
construction permit for phosphate equipment was not issued. DEQ staff 
discussed with Flint Water Treatment Plant operator Brent Wright and Utilities 
Superintendent Michael Glascow. Brent confirmed that he needs to provide 
some of the information regarding the phosphate product to LAN. 

• DEQ staff discussed with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright the need for 
quarterly test runs and monthly operation reporting details while the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant is in standby mode. Also included the need to report phosphate 
dosages and phosphate residuals (plant tap and distribution) in the monthly 
operation report. 

• John O’Brien (Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office) contacted DEQ 
staff in response to our October 22 e-mail. The Lapeer County Road 
Commission (LCRC) has placed a stop work order on Contract S-4005; however, 
the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office contends that the LCRC has 
no authority to issue a stop work order; thus, work is continuing. DEQ stressed 
the importance to John of the need to keep the project moving forward and to 
confirm that the contractor is following proper soil erosion measures and other 
local guidelines that may apply. 

• Based on a discussion with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright, there have not 
been major distribution system issues or upsets since the switch back to Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department. Utility operators were flushing and winterizing 
hydrants this week and flushing from the Flint Water Treatment Plant to the 
outside reaches of the distribution system. Phosphate residuals are also being 
measured twice per week at Flint’s bacteria monitoring sites. 

Additional Actions: 

• Representatives from DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS met on October 23 with Mayor 
Dayne Walling and Howard Croft from the city of Flint for the weekly update. 

Each group gave an overview of actions that were taken over the course of the 
week. The DEQ discussed sample results from homeowners since the offer to 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


provide free lead and copper testing was made. The DEQ also discussed the 
school sampling protocol that was developed and would be used on Saturday, 
October 24, at Freeman Elementary School. DLARA discussed the plumbing 
assessment of Freeman Elementary School that was being conducted on Friday, 
October 23. DHHS gave an update on the prioritization schema for blood lead 
screening that was being conducted for Flint residents, with the highest priority 
going to individuals with the highest risk, including young children and infants. 

• After the weekly coordination meeting, the city of Flint gave a tour of the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant to coordination committee members from the DEQ, 
DLARA, and DHFIS. The tour provided a complete picture of the treatment 
process for both sources of water that could potentially be used, including water 
from the Flint River and treated water coming from Detroit. There was also 
discussion on how water from the Karegnondi Water Authority would be 
distributed, along with discussion of the supplemental addition of corrosion 
control agents. 

• On Saturday, October 24, representatives of DEQ and DLARA conducted the 
first sampling event of Flint schools at Freeman Elementary School. Media from 
several news agencies were present to cover the initial sampling event and 
conducted interviews with Karen Tommasulo and footage was taken of the 
sampling process. The sampling team consisted of seven members, and it took 
a little over three hours to conduct the entire sampling event. There was a small 
group of protesters outside of the school who stayed there for approximately an 
hour and a half, after which they peacefully disbursed. 

After the sampling event, the samples were driven to the DEQ Laboratory and 
logged into the computer system. The Laboratory’s Inorganics Unit Supervisor 
was contacted and made aware of the status of the samples. The samples were 
then prepped on Sunday, October 25, and are scheduled for analysis on 
Monday, October 26.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff on October 27 to discuss all lead education 
material for schools, and action items were created. 

• On October 27 DEQ’s Lansing District Office received updated dosage, pump 
specifications, and cut-sheets for phosphate product. A quick glance at the 
submittal shows most of the requested information has been provided, except for 
the NSF Standard 60 certification and the maximum dose. Staff will cross- 
reference the NSF Web site to verify proper certification and maximum dose. If 
acceptable, DEQ staff will proceed with issuance of the Act 399 permit. 
Otherwise, the city of Flint’s consultant will need to provide the DEQ with the 
NSF Standard 60 certification and maximum dose information. 

• DEQ staff has cross-referenced 46 of the 326 historical lead and copper 
monitoring sampling sites with the 10,895 service line index card information 
records available to date. 

• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff to review and further develop childcare facility 
guidance and incorporate drinking water exposure information. Guidance is 
being provided by DHHS specific to the Genesee County emergency order, and 
separate guidance for statewide use will also be developed. 

Additional Actions: 

• Preliminary follow-up review of sampling event at Freeman Elementary School: 
DEQ and DLARA staff met and reviewed outlet/tap materials to correlate with 
sample results. DEQ staff contacted Jim Henry, Genesee County Health 
Department, to confirm the location of screening samples. The draft write-up is 
to be completed by DEQ staff on October 28. 

• The weekly meeting between DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS was held. Discussion 
topics included a review of the results for Freeman Elementary School, along 
with a discussion of what the results meant and how the data would be presented 
to the Flint Community Schools Superintendent so that the information could be 
used to create an action plan for the school. Discussion also included working 
out the logistics for conducting the plumbing evaluation and subsequent sampling 
for the other two elementary schools that had results above the action level 
during the initial screen of 13 schools. Plans are in process to conduct these two 
plumbing evaluations on Friday, October 30, with the sampling to take place on 
Saturday, October 31 .

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Comments on the corrosion control treatment plan received late in the day on 
October 30 from EPA were addressed, and the letter to the city of Flint regarding 
operational and monitoring conditions related to corrosion control was finalized. 

A PDF of the letter was e-mailed on October 30 to the city of Flint et al. 

• Staff from DLARA and DEQ conducted plumbing assessments at both Brownell 
and Eisenhower Elementary Schools on October 30. Sampling taps were 
identified and labeled. Based on the plumbing assessment, a sampling 
sequence was recommended for each school. 

Additional Actions: 

• DEQ Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian and DEQ Public Information 
Officer Karen Tommasulo met with representatives of DLARA, DHHS, and city of 
Flint officials, including Mayor Dayne Walling, to discuss progress made since 
the last meeting and to discuss actions to come in the week of November 2. 
Topics included the issuance of a construction permit that would enable the city 
of Flint to provide supplemental phosphate addition to the water coming from 
Detroit. A high level summary regarding the progress of the testing for lead in 
drinking water in the Flint schools was provided with a subsequent discussion by 
the group as a whole. Mayor Walling inquired as to how remediation of the 
schools would be funded, and he was informed that funding was outside the 
purview of the initial assessment. 

• Staff from DEQ and DLARA conducted water sampling at Brownell K-2 STEM 
Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on Saturday, October 31 . In 
addition, staff went back to Freeman Elementary School to pull sequential 
samples as per comments from EPA regarding DEQ’s sampling protocol. The 
sequential samples were also taken at Brownell and Eisenhower. Complete 
sampling protocols have now been conducted at three Flint schools. There were 
a total of 374 samples taken at the three schools on October 31 . 

• As provided by DHHS, the purchased total water filter/pitcher distribution for the 
period of October 6 through October 29 is 9,880 units.

Flint Fast Facts for WFNT interview 
From: Comms - Jess Brown 
DEQ-Brad Wurfel 
DHHS - Jennifer Smith 
Date: December 8, 2015 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

® Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 
o Children 0 - 5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

« Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement 
cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee 
County Community Action Resource Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, juice, baby 
formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five minutes before 
using the water 
• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This should be done as 
soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact your primary 
care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. For help with 
transportation, call 2-1-1. 

® Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards will help to 
protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels to clean up 
paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean around windows, play areas, and 
floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and wash clothes 
The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in Flint: 

1. SCHOOLS TESTING 

® The Governor's plan commits that DEQ will test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 schools in Flint have 
undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the state are completing one to two schools 
each weekend. 

® The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old drinking 
fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these fixtures are run for a 
couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these fixtures are removed, it will address the 
lead exposure in schools. 

® DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It means fixing the 
issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 



2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

® Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water sampling through 
the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, www.michigan.gov/FLINTWATER . 

® Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are encouraged to 
get kids tested for blood lead levels. 

3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

® The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like old faucets and 
lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan for removing the service lines. 
This is complicated because the service line is the portion that runs from the city system to the residence. It's 
the part that is mostly on private property and is generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

® DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to accomplish 
lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

® Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state approximately $20.8 million 
for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, 
build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that running river 
water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. The system has been in a 
serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this issue in the media. We are focused on the 
Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the (Kildee says 7,000) 
kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number came from. DHHS has numbers of 
kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not an issue we've addressed or plan to.

Governor, 

Attached is the bill report with the remaining bills left for signature. 

The Lt Governor will be available to sign bills on 12/30/15 while you are out of state. 
5 of the bills (4742, 4744, 518, 519, 446) must be signed and filed by 12/31/15.

Allison asked that I send to you the bill report to see if you would like the Lt Governor to 
sign the remaining bills that we have received or if you would like us to send you more 
bills tomorrow. One other option we have is for any bills due on 1/5 (except the 5 
mentioned above), can be signed the morning of 1/5 when you return. They are all due 
that day at l:20ish pm. 

Note that we do not have 571, 616 or 617. Those are on hold for right now. 

Thank you

Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work 
on the part of the City leaders:

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs.

Flint Water FAQ & Talking Points 

26-30 


Note: No changes from Weekend Briefing 








Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure? 

The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout 
Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint. 

Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint 
changed its water source (May 2014 - April 201 5) showed no significant change in the 
pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data 
suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an 
increase in lead exposure throughout the community. 

How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem? 

Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90 th percentile calculation. If more 
than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a 
violation. It triggers other requirements which could include public notification, additional 
water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment. 

While some of Flint’s individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action 
level, compliance is based on the 90 ,h percentile of samples. The City of Flint’s 90 th 
percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 201 1 , and 15 parts 
per billion in 1992, but never exceeded the action level. 

The two most recent sampling periods, in 2014 and 2015, were 6 parts per billion and 
1 1 parts per billion, respectively. 

Did the city use every sample they got back? 

Sampling requirements for lead and copper are designed to target the most common 
pathways to lead ingestion in homes with the least protection. The sample must be 
collected from a commonly used kitchen or bathroom tap, and in accordance with the 
provided sampling instructions. Homes that employ filtration or additional treatment 
cannot be included. Samples must also be collected within the established monitoring 
period. 

I have a lead service connection or lead plumbing. What should I do? 

Replacement is the only way to eliminate lead exposure. However, here are some 
interim steps homeowners can take to reduce it: 

Flush pipes before drinking, and only use cold water for consumption. 

The more time water has been sitting in your home’s pipes, the more lead it may 
contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer, 
"flush" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This 
could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home, 
such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer. 

Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making 
baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels of lead. 


2 



Who is responsible for replacement of leaded materials? 

Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials 
within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility. The City of Flint owns the service 
pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility. 
This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house 
is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner. 

Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines? 

Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make 
the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated 
effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels. 

What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment? 

The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal 
corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years. 

However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized 
Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months. 

What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year? 

The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior 
to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by 
KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and 
copper sampling every six months. Additionally, the city’s water treatment plant will 
continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment. 

How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint? 

The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these 
connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it 
would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work. 

What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house? 

Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to 
$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as 
well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered. 

With more than 15,000 lead service lines at an estimated average cost of $4,000 for 
each replacement, total cost could be $60 million or more.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 


• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

• All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 




The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 




WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

Flint Water Update from DEQ 

The Flint Drinking Water Action Plan was announced on October 2, 2015. It included the following: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately 

• Offered free water testing to Flint residents 

• Provided free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state assistance programs 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes 

• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

• Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint drinking water public health advisor 

• Boosted a comprehensive lead education program 

Testing in Flint Public Schools Immediately 

Samples were taken on October 2 and were received at DEQ. laboratory over the weekend. Test results to date indicate 
37 samples tested, 4 of which exceeded a federal action level, and 1 of those 4 was a significant outlier. We will be 
compiling detailed information about which schools and area codes the test results came from and will be providing that 
information in our next update. 

We have met with DFHHS, and we are working on developing response protocols, a communications plan, and guidance 
for schools when this data is reported. 

Offered Free Water Testing to Flint Residents 

We have received 4 sets of samples from Flint that represent individual residents. We will be compiling the total 
number and the results of those samples and reporting in a future report. 

Provided Free Water Filters to Residents with Concerns or Who are Included in State Assistance Programs 

DHHS held organizational meetings in Flint on October 5, and filter distribution by DHHS started on October 6. Nick Lyon 
in DHHS is taking the lead in filter distribution. 

Expanding Health Exposure Testing of Individual Homes 

Dr. Wells and Dan Wyant have been in conversations about a protocol for exposure testing. Dr. Wells will take the lead 
on developing the protocol. 

Accelerating Corrosion Controls in the Flint Drinking Water System 

A conference call was held with U.S. EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman and national corrosion control 
experts. We asked two questions: 

1. Which is a safer water source - DWSD or Flint River? 

2. If you don't have an opinion on the safer source, what criteria should we use for an evaluation? 

EPA staff would not commit to a preference, but their evaluation of the criteria clearly lead to the conclusion that DWSD 
was a safer water source. EPA committed to submitting technical assistance to the Safe Drinking Water Technical 
Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) meeting, which will be held on October 7 at 2:00 p.m. in Flint City Hall. 

DEQ met with the Flint Mayor, the city manager, and their water staff. Flint agreed to expediting corrosion controls. We 
discussed the agenda for the Advisory Committee meeting. The Advisory Committee will be asked to evaluate two 
respective water sources at their Wednesday meeting. 

We expect the Advisory Committee to recommend the water source that would address not only lead safety but also 
other water safety issues. 


Accelerating Water System Improvements to Address Replacing Lead Service Lines 



Conversations with Congressman Kildee and EPA have clarified the state would be allowed to use Drinking Water 
Revolving Loan funds to replace private drinking water service lines. Senator Ananich has been approached to introduce 
language clarifying the state's authority. 

Expediting the Completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority Pipeline 

Dan Wyant has talked to Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright. Mr. Wright has provided a list of issues that 
would help expedite the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. They include truck weight and frost 
law exemptions, talent identification, and expediting permits. 

Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

EPA has appointed their national technical expert to the Advisory Committee, and we have appointed Alfred Franzblau, 
M.D., Professor of Environmental Health Services, University of Michigan, to the Advisory Committee. 

Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor 

Boosted a Comprehensive Lead Education Program 

Other Updates 

• Dan Wyant was interviewed on 10/6 by CBS Evening News during filter distribution in Flint. Questions asked: 

o Was it a mistake to go to Flint River water? 

Answer: We draw water from the surface waters; we treat it to safe drinking water standards. At issue 
is lead exposure. Lead exposure must be addressed. Actions are being taken to address the issue, 
o Did you put kids at risk? 

Answer: Lead exposure is a serious issue, and steps need to be taken to limit lead exposure, 
o Why did it take so long? 

Answer: DEQ has been there from the beginning addressing the issue of Flint water. Recent tests justify 
and require the actions taken. Action steps address short-term, intermediate, and long-term lead issues 
to ensure public safety and confidence of the drinking water. 

• Dan Wyant also spoke to the Governor about Flint funding needs. A meeting is scheduled for October 7 at 8:00 
a.m. to further discuss proposals. 

• What we are telling Flint citizens is: 

o Have your water tested 

o Use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and preparing formula 
o Run water before use if it has not been used for several hours 
o Obtain a water filter approved for lead removal 
o Purchase lead-free plumbing components 
o Remove entire lead service lines 

Flint Water Update from Communications Team 

• CBS Evening News was in Flint Monday and Tuesday with coverage slated to air during tonight's 6 p.m news 
block nationally. Story isn't likely to be great, but should hopefully be fair and balanced. Will have ties into race, 
poverty, emergency management, and what state and locals did and knew when and how situation was 
handled. 

• We helped arrange interviews with DEQ Director Dan Wyant and DHHS' Cheryl Thompson, who is the deputy 
director for the Department's field services, an African American and also a Flint resident. They did those 
interviews from the now up and running water filter distribution centers at one of the two DHHS Flint offices. 

• They also did interviews with local Flint media. 

• Majority of media coverage both in Flint locally and statewide today to date has been on free water filter 
distribution so has been generally more positive. 

• Sen. Ananich was again urging immediate switch to Detroit water with comment "To me, the cost-benefit 
analysis that has cost on one side and brain damage for kids on the other — it's incomprehensible." 

• Erin Brockovich did an exclusive interview for WJRTTV 12 that's supposed to air tonight in the 5 p.m. news and 
the teaser is "one of the worst situations she's ever seen."

Talking points: 

• Protecting the health and safety of our residents in Flint and across Michigan is always our top priority. 

o All Michigan residents need access to safe, clean water 

• That's why today, in consultation with health and water experts in our state agencies, I'm advocating 
reconnecting the Flint drinking water with the Great Lakes Water Authority. 

• I'm recommending to my partners in the Legislature that the state government provide $6 million of the needed

Foundation is generously offered to donate $4 million. 

o The Michigan Department of FHealth and Fluman Services and the Department of Environmental Quality 
today also is committing an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water. 

• What you are seeing here today is a community coming together to work toward solving a problem. 

o I appreciate the assistance of Mayor Walling, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

o This is a collaborative approach, and I appreciate that community organizations including the United 
Way and come forward to assist. 




Today's announcement in an important step as we move forward together, 
o But it is not our first step, nor will it be our last. 



• This announcement builds on work we've already set in place. 

• That includes $4.2 million in state grants and loan restructuring to help identify and fix 
infrastructure problems. 

• State agencies have been working closely with Flint leaders and the community for more 
than a year. 

There will be more to do. 

o Flint has an aging water infrastructure system with challenges that we - together - will continue to 
address. 

We will continue to test Flint schools for lead levels in drinking water, 
o Schools across the state might also have questions. 

o The Department of Environmental Quality will work with districts across the state to provide testing. 

• Districts can send water samples and paperwork and the nominal charge. (It costs $26 per 
sample). 


The steps outlined in the comprehensive action plan are still in effect. 



FAQs for Media Q&As 


Switch to Great Lakes Water Authority 

What finally pushed the state to this decision? 

This was the City's request, and the Governor supports it, based on several key factors: 

In the near term, DWSD water will be easier to manage. It comes from a more stable source than the river, it is fully 
optimized for corrosion control, and it is clear that residents of Flint have more confidence in this water source. 

Will this solve Flint's water crisis? 

In combination with the other short term, intermediate term and long-term steps outlined last week, this move 
represents a big step forward. Flint still has serious system maintenance challenges it must address. 

If you're saying residents will still have lead because of their plumbing, does that mean every other city in this state 
has a lead problem? 

Many areas of the state have lead in their infrastructure mix. 

Where's the state getting the money to fund this? 

We have submitted a formal request to lawmakers via the appropriations process. 

Where's the city getting the money to fund this? 

The city is contributing all it can, and is getting assistance for its match from the Mott Foundation. 

How long will the switch take? 

The switch will be completed by the City and Great lakes Water Authority, but our understanding is that it can be 
accomplished in the very near term once the arrangements are complete. 

How long will it take before Detroit's corrosion controls provide protection for Flint? 

It will take some time for the corrosion control additives to build on pipe walls throughout the system. Estimates vary. 
The state can assure we will commence monitoring of the system early 2016 and report results as we get them to keep 
the community updated. 

Why do residents still need to use filters and bottled water? 

The filters and bottled water are responsible precautions for any resident concerned about lead exposure. 

Do the filters actually work? We've been hearing they don't protect for lead. 

Yes, the filters work. They are all certified for lead removal by the National Sanitation Foundation. 

The filters are only good for 100 gallons. What happens when they are used up? 

They will need to be replaced. And residents can get a new filter. 

What about restaurants? 

What's going to be done about lead service lines? 

Long term, this is the only permanent solution to lead exposure. The state has committed to helping the city accomplish 
this goal long term. 




Do you wish you'd made this switch sooner? 

We support the City's decision. We can't look backward. We feel the state has responded quickly and effectively as 
information has surfaced, been investigated and verified. While the City of Flint is, right now, in compliance with the 
federal Lead and 

Copper Rule, we recognize there is a disparity between surveillance testing and other testing happening in the 
community that we need to better understand and we are working on developing our knowledge. 

Schools testing 

What do these results say? 

The results say we need to further investigate Flint schools and help the schools find clearer causes for some the results 
we got. 

Any theories about what's going on? 

It is possible there are specific points in the plumbing that have lead components which need to be replaced, but we 
can't say anything definitively until we perform an investigation at each school. 

Do the schools have lead service lines? If not, why are they getting such high results? 

The schools we tested initially do not have lead service lines. There are a few possible reasons why lead is being 
detected at specific points in the buildings and not others. When we know things definitively, we will make the 
information public. 

How long do the schools have to stay on bottled water? Just until the switch to Detroit, or longer term? 

We are encouraging the schools to continue their current protective measures as a precaution until we can get into the 
buildings and get more answers. 

Why did you only test 13 schools? 

That was what the Flint Public Schools requested. 

What happens to other schools? 

We will test all the schools in Flint if they request it. 

What about the schools that can't afford to update their entire plumbing systems? 

This is why we are having plumbing assessments completed. There is no way to know yet what each building will 
require. 

How confident are you in your testing? You've got results all over the map. 

We are confident that our testing meets the requirements for the federal Lead and Copper Rule, which is surveillance 
monitoring. The bigger question is whether surveillance monitoring meets the public health protection standards that 
Lead Exposure Testing methods do. The EPA is working on that question now, and we are engaged in that dialogue. 

What do you mean by "health exposure testing"? What are you doing next? 


The 90 th percentile of your results is still below 15 ppb. Does that make you more or less confident in your testing and 
in your protocols? 



It makes us confident that the testing protocol delivers consistent results. But again, it does raise questions about 
whether this testing method shows what people think it does or what they really want to know, which is actual lead 
exposure from lead plumbing in a home. 

Any idea how long kids have been exposed to lead? Was it before the move to the Flint River? 

That is possible. We don't know. 

How does the state bring this new information into the broader picture of kids' lead exposure across the state? 



Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points for Director Lyon and Dr. Wells 


Water Filters 

• Our first action item is to work closely with our public and private partners to provide water filters to Flint 
residents and MDHHS clients. 

• To meet this priority, the governor identified one million dollars in state funding to purchase water filters for 
Flint residents. 

• The Brita SAFF-100 filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the NSF/ANSI 53 standards 
for drinking water treatment units. 

• The Brita faucet filtration system we are distributing are National Sanitation Foundation certified to reduce lead 
in drinking water. 

• Free water filters are available to current Michigan Department of Health and Human Services clients and Flint 
residents who are on the Flint water system at four locations: 

o Flint residents who are not current MDHHS clients should visit one of two Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices to obtain a filter. 

■ at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint 

o Current MDHHS clients in the city of Flint should visit their local MDHHS office 

■ At 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 

• Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

• Extended hours are being offered at the Lippincott facility only, and will run until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, 
and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The other three locations will maintain 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. operating hours, 
Monday through Friday, for filter pick up. 

• Given the questions and concerns regarding the change in water source in Flint, MDHHS authorized the use of 
emergency services funding to provide water filters for MDHHS clients receiving assistance in the city of Flint. 

• This funding will support active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food Assistance Program (FAP), Child 
Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance (SDA), State Disability Assistance (SDA), or Social 
Security Insurance (SSI) recipients so that they can obtain filters that are National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) 
certified to remove lead and ANSI Standard 53. 

• MDHHS currently serves approximately 25,000 households in Flint. 


School Testing and Results 

• The state today also released the first results from its free lead screening program in schools. 

• Out of 13 buildings tested, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 
parts per billion. 

• However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and MDHHS toxicologists will work with DEO. to conduct 
further testing. 

• Schools on the Flint water system should continue using filtered or bottled water to protect against potential 
lead exposure. 

Background Information 

• Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in Flint have followed an expected 
seasonal trend; due to small numbers further analysis was initiated. 




• While this analysis of blood lead levels in Flint as a whole remains true, after a comprehensive and detailed 
review down to the zip code level, we have found that the state analysis is consistent with that presented by 
Hurley. 

• Director Lyon is working closely with DEQ and the administration to take active steps to reduce all potential lead 
exposures in Flint, and across the state. 

• Our Chief Medical Executive has been in communication with the lead investigator at Hurley Children's Hospital, 
and we continue to work with Hurley, the city of Flint, local and state leaders to verify and analyze data trends. 

• Zip code-level data does show that there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in specific 
communities. 

o This does not conclusively mean that the water source change is the sole cause of the increase, but data 
does show an association. 

o There is an increased proportion of children with elevated Blood Levels (ELBs) in several zip codes, 
particularly 03 and 04. These appear to have increased over the last 1.5 years. 

o Lead exposure can occur from a number of different sources (such as paint, gasoline, solder, and 
consumer products) and through different pathways (such as air, food, water, dust, and soil). 

o Although there are several exposure sources, lead-based paint is still the most widespread and 
dangerous high-dose source of lead exposure for young children in the US and Michigan. 

• We reviewed MDHHS statewide data using the same methodology used by Hurley, looking at our numbers by 
zip code and age ranges, and filtering out non-Flint children. 

• Routine surveillance of blood lead levels does not analyze data down to the zip code level. Detailed analysis like 
this occurs when there is reason to focus in on precise locations or populations. 

• MDHHS is working closely with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Hurley Children's Hospital, 
the Genesee County Health Department, and community organizations to initiate further action steps. 

• We understand that cost may be a barrier to following the recommendations for drinking water, which is why 
NSF certified filters are being distributed to residents on the Flint water system free of charge. 

• MDHHS is recommending that residents follow the Public Health Advisory issued by the Genesee County Health 
Department, as well as take further steps to reduce exposures to all forms of lead in and around their homes. 


MDHHS Stats and Facts 

• 'High Risk' Zip codes (48503 and 48504) 

o Blood lead level rates among children under six years of age in the high risk zip codes (48503, 48504) 
were 2.7 times higher than the rest of Genesee County before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o After the switch to Flint River Water, rates in the high risk Zip codes were 3.2 times that of the rest of 
Genesee County. 

• Other Zip codes in Flint 

o Rates of elevated blood lead levels among children under six years of age in other parts of the city of 
Flint were 2 times that of the rest of Genesee County before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o The magnitude of the elevated rate remained roughly the same during the period after the water source 
switch. 

• Lead abatement through MDHHS was federally funded up until FY14 when Michigan began providing additional 
funds to abate homes. 

• In FY14, $1.25M General Fund was added. In FY15, General Fund was bumped up to $1.75M and FY16, General 
Fund remains at $1.75M. 



Reducing and Removing Lead Exposure 


• In housing built before 1978, it can be assumed that the paint has lead unless tests show otherwise. 

• Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint. 

• Children and pregnant women should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. 
They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is 
completed. 

• Create barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed, you 
should clean and isolate all sources of lead. 

o Close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply 
temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, to cover holes in walls or to block children's 
access to other sources of lead. 

• Regularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or 
exterior soil. Both are known lead sources. 

• Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, 
you should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. 

o Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, 
windows should be shut to prevent abrasion of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash. 

• Take off shoes when entering the house to prevent bringing lead-contaminated soil in from outside. 

• Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Plant grass on areas of bare 
soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. 

o Until the bare soil is covered, move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the 

house. If you have a sandbox, cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. 
That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste. 

• Avoid using makeup, containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or liquids that are not shown to 
be lead free. 

• Remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children. 

• Use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Hot water is more likely to 
contain higher levels of lead. Most of the lead in household water usually comes from the plumbing in your 
house, not from the local water supply. 

• Shower and change clothes after finishing a task that involves working with lead-based products such as stained 
glass, making bullets, or using a firing range. 


WIC Children 

• There are 855 infants participating in WIC in Flint. 

• We are working with partners at the United Way to ensure that WIC families have access to water filters and 
bottled water. 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official source of unsanitary water 
supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to-feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if 
they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water. 



Flint water action plan - next steps 
Communications & Outreach Plan 


Situation overview: 

Water and concerns about lead levels in the city of Flint have been escalating since the city moved to the Flint River as 
its source of water after switching from DWSD in the spring of 2014 with local plans to move to a new water authority - 
the Karegnondi Water Authority or KWA - slated to be online in June 2016. Numerous tests have shown the water 
overall to be safe with non-detect lead levels when leaving Flint water treatment plan and below widely recognized 
federal action levels (15 ppb) in most surveillance monitoring. However, like many communities across the state and 
country, Flint's infrastructure is aging and hasn't been updated in decades, facing outdated lead service connections and 
lead pipes in individual homes. Some water tests have indicated definite elevated lead levels within some homes, 
neighborhoods and zip codes, with some children in those same areas also experiencing elevated lead levels, causing 
great concern for all parties. 

Race, poverty and local governance (with city's history of emergency managers) have all been railed as issues or 
allegations, adding to the challenges. 

Given all factors involved, it has been deemed prudent and best for public health and restoring confidence in water 
system to temporarily switch back to Detroit water, now governed by an entity called the Great Lakes Water Authority, 
as the city's water source until the new KWA is completed. A specie:! technical advisory committee comprised of public 
health and drinking water experts has concurred and recommended such a path. The cost to do so is estimated at about 
$12M over nine months. The state is proposing to cover about half of the cost with the city ($2M) and community 
organizations (C.S. Mott Foundation at $4M) pledging to cover the balance. 

Goals/obiectives: 

• Ensure governor and state focus is on protecting public health and ensuring safe, accessible drinking water and all 
the action steps that are being taken to help ensure those two priorities. 

• Minimize and diffuse finger pointing and tension between all stakeholders. 

• Effective, concise communication that makes it clear for both residents and schools what next steps are and that 
state is committed to doing everything it can to help address situation in partnership and collaboration with city and 
community leaders. 

• Restore confidence in Flint water. 

• Convey shared responsibility to address.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure 
monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer.

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from 
large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, 
the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using 
phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

INSERT MOTT FOUNDATION QUOTE HERE 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four 
locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents 
who have questions about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will 
be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. on Saturday. 


Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap 
and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 1 5 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at 

www.michiqan.gov/fNntwater .

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The Flint pipeline is ready and has been placed into service. Water from the 
Great Lakes Water Authority began flowing on Friday, October 16. 

• Continued working with Karegnondi Water Authority toward addressing the 
construction bottlenecks. 

• The corrosion control proposal was received electronically from Lockwood, 
Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN), Flint’s consultant, on October 16 (without 399 
application). Staff is reviewing the proposal and preparing comments. The 
proposal was forwarded to EPA for their review, with comments requested by 
October 19. EPA acknowledged receipt of the proposal. On October 16 LAN 
hand delivered a full-sized set of the proposal, along with a signed permit 
application. 

• The city of Flint provided information during the initial coordination meeting that 
approximately 25% of the index card conversion has taken place. The cards 
have been given to the University of Michigan-Flint for entry into GIS. The city of 
Flint has indicated that this is a slow process, and they are looking at ways to 
speed up the process. This is a manually intensive process, and they lack the 
resources to accomplish the task faster. 

• The city of Flint will provide a link to the GIS mapping, and Howard Croft of the 
city of Flint gave a short presentation on how to use the GIS mapping program. 

Additional Actions: 

• George Krisztian and Karen Tommasulo represented the DEQ in the initial 
weekly coordination meeting with the city of Flint on October 1 6. Present were 
representatives from DEQ, DLARA, DHHS, and the city of Flint. Each partner 
provided a brief synopsis of what their respective group had done the past week, 
and there was discussion on action steps for the following week. Additional 
discussion included presenting a unified message, creation of a homeowners 
water sampling instructions work group, and inclusion of the Genesee County 
Health Department (GCHD) for the weekly coordination meetings. 

• George Krisztian, Karen Tommasulo, and Liane Shekter Smith represented the 
DEQ in an October 16 meeting with the Flint Community Schools 
Superintendent, Bilal Tawwab. Also present were representatives from DLARA, 
DHHS, and the Principals from the first three schools that are going through the 
plumbing evaluation protocol as well as additional staff from Flint Community 
Schools. The DEQ provided an overview of the protocol that includes a plumbing 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


evaluation, subsequent sampling of all faucets and drinking fountains that are 
used for consumptive purposes, analysis of the samples, consolidation of the 
data, and then review of the data from a health-based exposure perspective. 
There was also discussion that the GCHD would be asked to conduct the 
sampling so that we ensure all aspects of the data are of the highest possible 
quality. There was also discussion of the need to ensure that the 
Superintendent’s office receives the data along with comments on the data 
before the data is made public. It was agreed that all partners (DEQ, DLARA, 
DHHS, the Superintendent, the city of Flint, and GCHD) would all be provided the 
data along with context before the data was released to the public. It was also 
agreed that there needed to be coordination with respect to who would be 
releasing the data to the public. 

• George Krisztian, Karen Tommasulo, and Liane Shekter Smith met on 

October 16 with James Henry of the GCHD. The purpose of the meeting was to: 

o Invite the GCHD to attend the weekly coordination meeting with the city of 
Flint. 

o Ask if the GCHD would be willing to take the samples for the school 
plumbing evaluations. 

o Invite Mr. Henry to be part of the homeowners water sampling instructions 
work group. 

o The GCHD provided a positive response on all three subjects but did 

indicate that they would need funding to assist with the sampling. GCHD 
was asked to submit a request to the DEQ so that the question of funding 
could be addressed formally.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

• DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 
representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHHS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 1 6, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 

• Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCHD is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 

• DHHS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The initial After Action Plan meeting was held on October 22. Topics covered 
were: 

o The discussion of the roles of each team member 
o The scope of the After Action Plan 

o The time frame in which the After Action Plan is to be completed 
The main components of the After Action Plan are: 

o An After Action Review Summary time line that details critical events in 
chronological order, asking key questions, and providing explanations for 
actions taken 

o Implementation of the Governor’s 10-point Action Plan 
o An evaluation of if DEQ made mistakes and, if so, what they were 

o An evaluation of lessons learned, defining what we can do better/differently 

in the future 

• Participated on an October 22 conference call with the EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking 
Water Task Force to discuss proposed sampling protocol and the comments 
received from EPA. Agreed to reconvene a call next week to discuss how the 
pilot sampling effort goes, what went well, what might need to be adjusted, etc. 

• A summary of our discussion with EPA regarding Flint’s corrosion control plan 
was provided to Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA. The summary 
included confirmation of the actual phosphate dosage from the Detroit Lake 
Huron Water Treatment Plant. 

• Proper dosages are now confirmed, based on incoming phosphate residual at 
Flint. A product cut-sheet to confirm NSF approval and maximum dose is to be 
provided shortly. Flint’s consultant (Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc.) will 
also confirm proper sizing of the feed pumps. Anticipate receiving this 
information on October 23, which will facilitate issuance of the Act 399 permit. 

• An updated monitoring schedule is completed and signed. The schedule will be 
mailed to the city of Flint on October 23. A copy of the updated monitoring 
schedule is attached. 

• An e-mail was sent to John O’Brien of Genesee County informing him of our 
concern over improper soil erosion control measures at the pipeline job site and 
what corrective measures were being taken to avoid a potential halt of 
construction by the Lapeer County Road Commission. Genesee County has not 
responded thus far.

Additional Actions: 

• A conference call was held among representatives from DEQ/DLARA/DHHS to 
further discuss ways to ensure that the efforts of all three agencies were 
coordinated. It was determined that weekly calls providing updates to the group 
as a whole would be beneficial. DEQ also agreed to copy DLARA and DHHS on 
their daily update report to the Governor’s office. 

• Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian contacted Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab to obtain permission to allow the Detroit 
Free Press to take footage of the water sampling process to be conducted at 
Freeman Elementary School on Saturday, October 24. Superintendent Tawwab 
gave his permission, stating that it would not be an issue since there would not 
be any students present. 

• DLARA completed additional review of documents at the Flint repository to assist 
with the sequencing at the schools. 

• Flint is able to provide DLARA plumbing inspectors with on-site workspace; 
additional documentation gives greater guidance on locations for plumbing 
fixtures. 

• DLARA received confirmation from DEQ that bottles and necessary equipment 
will be available for sampling start on Saturday, October 24.

Mr. Brent Wright 

City Of Flint -D.P.W WSSN: 02310 

Flint Water Plant 

4500 North Dort Highway 

Flint, Michigan 48505 

Dear Mr. Wright: 

SUBJECT: Revised Drinking Water Monitoring Schedule - 2015 
Monthly Operation Reports 
Siting Plans and Record Keeping 

Monitoring Schedule: 

Enclosed is your revised Drinking Water Monitoring Schedule for remainder of calendar 
year 201 5 outlining the minimum requirements for your public water supply. Your 
schedule has been revised based on the City’s change in source of its drinking water 
from the treatment of the Flint River utilizing the City’s Water Treatment Plant to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority/Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collect samples 
early in the monitoring period of the year indicated on the schedule. If you use a private 
laboratory you are required to report the results to us within the first ten days of the 
month following the month that you received the results. To receive credit for 
monitoring, the "WSSN” (water supply serial number), the "Site Code," and "County" 
must appear on the sample result. Bottles will NOT be mailed automatically. If you use 
the Department of Environmental Quality Laboratory, you can order bottles by calling 
517-335-8184. Be certain of the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
sampling and analysis method requirements for hold times. 

Monthly Operation Report (MOR) Requirements: 

The City shall submit MORs as required under Administrative Rule 1502 (R325.11502). 
Please note required coliform bacteria monitoring results and associated chlorine 
residual monitoring shall be submitted to the department within the first 10 days 
following the end of the required monthly monitoring period. In addition, monthly 
operation reports shall be submitted to the department during the month following the 
month for which the monthly operation report was prepared.

Disinfection By-Product Sample Siting Plans: 

The City of Flint shall continue routine standard monitoring of disinfection by-products, 
according to your Disinfection & Disinfectants By-Product (DDBP) plan which identifies 
8 sites for routine quarterly monitoring. 

Lead and Copper Monitoring Requirements and Site Sample Pool 

Please note distribution system monitoring for water quality parameters (WQPs) 
continues at the expanded set of 25 sites per quarter. Lead and copper monitoring in 
accordance with the requirements of Administrative Rule 710a (R325. 10710a) is being 
required for the 6 month period between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The City 
must ensure its sample site pool is large enough to collect the number of lead and 
copper tap samples required. All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall 
be selected from the pool of targeted sampling sites. 

The City shall also conduct additional operational monitoring to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of corrosion control treatment. 


Record Keeping: 


The City shall maintain all monitoring records in accordance with all applicable 
requirements under the Administrative Rules including Rule 720a (R325. 10720a), 

Rule 1506 (R325.1 1506), and Rule 1507 (R325.11507). 

The Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act requires certain reports to be submitted to this 
office each year. Please remember that cross connection reports and annual pumpage 
reports are due by March 31 , and the Consumer Confidence Report is due by July 1 . 


Also enclosed is the document “2015 Monitoring and Reporting Requirements.” This

Community Water Supply 
2015 Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 

Please Monitor Early: Collect samples early in the monitoring period (month, quarter, 
year) of the year indicated on the schedule. Bacteriological and partial chemistry 
samples should be collected close to the shipping time and sent overnight delivery to 
assure sample holding times are not exceeded (30 and 48 hour hold times respectively). 
We also recommend avoiding mailing bacteriological samples immediately preceding or 
following a holiday because samples tend to exceed the 30 hour hold time. When this 
occurs, a repeat sample must be collected as soon as possible upon notification. 

If you use a private laboratory please report the results to us within the first ten days of 
the month following the month that you received the results. A list of certified 
laboratories is available on request. If samples are not collected as indicated on your 
monitoring schedule, you will incur a monitoring violation and possibly a fine. For 
information on the fines policy, visit http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking 
Water, Community Water Supply, and Administrative Fines (under Laws and Rules). 


To receive credit for monitoring, you must include the "WSSN” (water supply serial 
number), the "Site Code," and the "County" when you submit samples for analysis. 
Site codes are listed on your monitoring schedule. 


Special Instructions If You Use The DEQ Laboratory: Bottles will NOT be mailed 
automatically. To order bottles, call the DEQ Laboratory at 517-335-8184 or download 
the form EQP 2301 Requisition for Water Sample Units from www.michigan.gov/deq. 
Click on Key Topics, Laboratory Services, Drinking Water, Obtaining The Necessary 
Sampling Units, and 'test list’. Please note that the DEQ laboratory is closed on most 
state holidays. The DEQ laboratory prices are subject to change without notice. 

Special Instructions For Automated Partial Chemistry, VQC and TTHM Samples : These 
sample bottles must be cooled and preserved during shipment to the laboratory. If you 
use the DEQ laboratory, you will receive the ice pack, acid dropper (if necessary) and 
small cooler when you request the bottles. Samples must be preserved correctly to be 
used for compliance purposes. To avoid resampling follow instructions contained with 
the sample bottle, if you would like more information, contact the DEQ lab, at 
517-335-8184, or contact this office. 

Cyanide : Previously, supplies that chlorinated the water were waived from monitoring 
for cyanide. The U.S. EPA now requires all supplies to sample the entry point for 
cyanide. 

UCMR3 Monitoring : You may have monitoring requirements in 2015 under the third 
Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3). The U.S. EPA will contact you 
directly if your water supply is required to monitor in 2015. A list of laboratories certified 
to analyze the samples collected for UCMR3 is available at 

http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3/upload/lablist.pdf. Contact 
the U.S. EPA with questions.

Reminder if Lead and Copper Monitoring Due This Year : Provide individual lead tap 
results to people who receive water from sites that you sampled, even if lead was not 
detected, within 30 days of learning the results. Send us a certification that you met all 
the delivery requirements along with a sample copy of the customer notice within 3 
months after the end of the monitoring period. Water supplies that failed to distribute the 
Consumer Notice of Lead Results must include the following statement in their CCR, 
"During the year, we failed to provide lead results to persons served at the sites that 
were tested as required by the Lead and Copper Rule.” To download the Lead and 
Copper Report and Consumer Notice of Lead Result Certificate in Microsoft Word or 
PDF format, visit www.michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community 
Water Supply, and Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). 

Annual Reports : These reports are due to this office each year. 

• The Cross Connection Report, due by March 31 , describes the status of your 
local cross connection control program. Manufactured housing communities are 
exempt from this requirements until 2016. 

Each year, water supplies must submit this report, even if a formal program has 
not been implemented. If cross connections do not exist in your water system, 
indicate so on the report. Download the Cross Connection Report form from 
http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). Instructions are 
included with the form. 

• The Annual Pumpage/Usage Report, due by March 31 , is required of water 
supplies that do not submit monthly operation reports. 

This summary of water pumpage and water use must be submitted by each 
water supply that does not submit a monthly operation report. To manage our 
natural resources, pumpage data are compiled to determine water use demands 
in Michigan. Download the Annua! Pumpage/Usage Report form from 
http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). Please be sure 
to indicate the appropriate units on the report (e g. million gallons or gallons). 

• The Consumer Confidence Report, due by July 1 to your customers, to your 
local health department and to this office, describes the quality of the water and 
characterizes the risks, if any, from exposure to contaminants detected.. 

Electronic delivery methods may be used to distribute the CCR to bill-paying 
customers, provided the method is direct. A paper copy must be delivered to bill- 
paying customers who request it or known to be unable to receive the CCR 
electronically. For more information on e-delivery, visit 
www.michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Consumer Confidence Report Rule (under Laws and Rules).

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The sampling protocol was revised to address comments received on October 22 
from EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force. 

• Staff assisted DLARA in conducting a plumbing assessment at Freeman 
Elementary School. Actions were taken to prepare for sampling to be conducted 
on Saturday, October 24. 

• The information requested by the DEQ was not received on October 23 from 
Flint’s consultant, Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN); thus, the 
construction permit for phosphate equipment was not issued. DEQ staff 
discussed with Flint Water Treatment Plant operator Brent Wright and Utilities 
Superintendent Michael Glascow. Brent confirmed that he needs to provide 
some of the information regarding the phosphate product to LAN. 

• DEQ staff discussed with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright the need for 
quarterly test runs and monthly operation reporting details while the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant is in standby mode. Also included the need to report phosphate 
dosages and phosphate residuals (plant tap and distribution) in the monthly 
operation report. 

• John O’Brien (Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office) contacted DEQ 
staff in response to our October 22 e-mail. The Lapeer County Road 
Commission (LCRC) has placed a stop work order on Contract S-4005; however, 
the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office contends that the LCRC has 
no authority to issue a stop work order; thus, work is continuing. DEQ stressed 
the importance to John of the need to keep the project moving forward and to 
confirm that the contractor is following proper soil erosion measures and other 
local guidelines that may apply. 

• Based on a discussion with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright, there have not 
been major distribution system issues or upsets since the switch back to Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department. Utility operators were flushing and winterizing 
hydrants this week and flushing from the Flint Water Treatment Plant to the 
outside reaches of the distribution system. Phosphate residuals are also being 
measured twice per week at Flint’s bacteria monitoring sites. 

Additional Actions: 

• Representatives from DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS met on October 23 with Mayor 
Dayne Walling and Howard Croft from the city of Flint for the weekly update. 

Each group gave an overview of actions that were taken over the course of the 
week. The DEQ discussed sample results from homeowners since the offer to 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


provide free lead and copper testing was made. The DEQ also discussed the 
school sampling protocol that was developed and would be used on Saturday, 
October 24, at Freeman Elementary School. DLARA discussed the plumbing 
assessment of Freeman Elementary School that was being conducted on Friday, 
October 23. DHHS gave an update on the prioritization schema for blood lead 
screening that was being conducted for Flint residents, with the highest priority 
going to individuals with the highest risk, including young children and infants. 

• After the weekly coordination meeting, the city of Flint gave a tour of the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant to coordination committee members from the DEQ, 
DLARA, and DHFIS. The tour provided a complete picture of the treatment 
process for both sources of water that could potentially be used, including water 
from the Flint River and treated water coming from Detroit. There was also 
discussion on how water from the Karegnondi Water Authority would be 
distributed, along with discussion of the supplemental addition of corrosion 
control agents. 

• On Saturday, October 24, representatives of DEQ and DLARA conducted the 
first sampling event of Flint schools at Freeman Elementary School. Media from 
several news agencies were present to cover the initial sampling event and 
conducted interviews with Karen Tommasulo and footage was taken of the 
sampling process. The sampling team consisted of seven members, and it took 
a little over three hours to conduct the entire sampling event. There was a small 
group of protesters outside of the school who stayed there for approximately an 
hour and a half, after which they peacefully disbursed. 

After the sampling event, the samples were driven to the DEQ Laboratory and 
logged into the computer system. The Laboratory’s Inorganics Unit Supervisor 
was contacted and made aware of the status of the samples. The samples were 
then prepped on Sunday, October 25, and are scheduled for analysis on 
Monday, October 26.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff on October 27 to discuss all lead education 
material for schools, and action items were created. 

• On October 27 DEQ’s Lansing District Office received updated dosage, pump 
specifications, and cut-sheets for phosphate product. A quick glance at the 
submittal shows most of the requested information has been provided, except for 
the NSF Standard 60 certification and the maximum dose. Staff will cross- 
reference the NSF Web site to verify proper certification and maximum dose. If 
acceptable, DEQ staff will proceed with issuance of the Act 399 permit. 
Otherwise, the city of Flint’s consultant will need to provide the DEQ with the 
NSF Standard 60 certification and maximum dose information. 

• DEQ staff has cross-referenced 46 of the 326 historical lead and copper 
monitoring sampling sites with the 10,895 service line index card information 
records available to date. 

• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff to review and further develop childcare facility 
guidance and incorporate drinking water exposure information. Guidance is 
being provided by DHHS specific to the Genesee County emergency order, and 
separate guidance for statewide use will also be developed. 

Additional Actions: 

• Preliminary follow-up review of sampling event at Freeman Elementary School: 
DEQ and DLARA staff met and reviewed outlet/tap materials to correlate with 
sample results. DEQ staff contacted Jim Henry, Genesee County Health 
Department, to confirm the location of screening samples. The draft write-up is 
to be completed by DEQ staff on October 28. 

• The weekly meeting between DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS was held. Discussion 
topics included a review of the results for Freeman Elementary School, along 
with a discussion of what the results meant and how the data would be presented 
to the Flint Community Schools Superintendent so that the information could be 
used to create an action plan for the school. Discussion also included working 
out the logistics for conducting the plumbing evaluation and subsequent sampling 
for the other two elementary schools that had results above the action level 
during the initial screen of 13 schools. Plans are in process to conduct these two 
plumbing evaluations on Friday, October 30, with the sampling to take place on 
Saturday, October 31 .

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Discussion held on October 28 with EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force 
(Task Force) concerning monitoring results at Freeman Elementary School. A 
report that summarizes the results of the samples collected from the school for 
the lead analysis has been drafted. 

• DEQ staff discussed the items needed for the corrosion control treatment plan. 
An outline of a Corrosion Treatment Operation letter has been prepared. The 
letter will be finalized and sent to the city of Flint. Water quality parameter 
monitoring and laboratory certification was also discussed with the EPA’s Task 
Force. 

• DEQ staff completed the review and verified NSF Standard 60 conformance, 
proper dosage, and feed pump sizing. The Act 399 permit for the installation of 
the phosphate feed equipment was issued on October 28. 

• Coordinated with the DEQ Laboratory to create and produce the “Request for 
Water Analysis Forms” and the bottle order needed for sampling at Brownell K-2 
STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on Saturday, October 31 . 

Additional Action: 

DEQ Director Dan Wyant and DEQ staff met with DHHS Director Nick Lyon and DHHS 
staff to discuss coordination of the messaging of data related to Flint water and blood 
samples. It was agreed that it was important to ensure that the water and blood data 
are put into context with respect to each other. Discussion also involved creating a 
message that discusses what lead concentrations in water mean from a regulatory and 
from a health-based perspective. Current regulations are not in step with current 
health-based exposure models, so additional work needs to be done to ensure a 
comprehensive message that is clear.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 3, 201 5, DHHS released blood lead level testing data. The data covered 
the time frame between January 1 , 201 0, and November 1 3, 2015. The data was 
broken down by population set and by demographic. The population sets included the 
state of Michigan as a whole, Genesee County as a whole, and the city of Flint ZIP 
Codes 48501 to 48507. The demographic sets broke the populations down into the age 
groups of: “Children younger than 6 Years Old,” “Children 6 to 17 Years Old,” “Adults 18 
Years and Older,” and “Total Number of People of All Ages Tested.” 

On December 3, 2015, the DEQ released the lead in drinking water data and final report 
for Eisenhower Elementary School. The findings in the report were very similar in 
nature to those found in the report for Freeman Elementary School. There were a 
number of fixtures and plumbing immediately adjacent to fixtures that were imparting 
lead into the water. The report recommends replacement of these fixtures and related 
plumbing. 

On December 4 and 5, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted a plumbing 
evaluation and subsequent sampling of the fixtures used for drinking water consumption 
at Potter Elementary School in Flint. There were a total number of 288 samples taken 
at 57 different locations throughout the school. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report since last week. 

Concerns : 

There are no new concerns to report since last week. 

Significant Events : 

On November 30, 2015, Director Dan Wyant and George Krisztian met with water 
quality expert Dr. Joan Rose of Michigan State University. The purpose of the meeting 
was to discuss the situation in Flint and to seek guidance on approaches for addressing 
the issue. Dr. Rose expressed that she felt there were three different fronts necessary 
to address the issue. These were to create a “Trust Plan,” a “Communications Plan,” 
and a plan to “Get the lead out.” Dr. Rose provided several different examples of 
communities that had undergone similar challenges and what approaches worked and 
what approaches did not.

On December 3, 2015, representatives from the Governor’s office, DEQ, and Office of 
Urban Initiatives met with Flint City Mayor Karen Weaver and members of her transition 
team. The purpose of the meeting was primarily introductory in nature, and the 
conversations were at a high level discussing the needs of the city as well as how 
communications with the residents of the city could be improved. There was also 
discussion of the lead testing results, both for home owners and in the schools. There 
was particular interest in the sampling protocol that was used to obtain samples in the 
schools. Overall, the conversation was very positive, with everyone agreeing that a 
coordinated effort was necessary to be able to effectively address the lead issue. 

On December 3, 201 5, Director Dan Wyant was interviewed by Lori Jane Gliha for a 
segment on America Tonight. The questions mainly focused on what had happened in 
the past and were tough. The responses echoed the message that the DEQ 
empathizes with the residents of Flint; we are committed to bringing about a resolution; 
we have a plan; we are moving forward; and we recognize that we need to rebuild trust 
in the community. 

On December 4, 2015, representatives of the DEQ (Jim Sygo, Karen Tommasulo, and 
George Krisztian) met with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and other city officials for the 
weekly coordination meeting. Calling into the meeting were representatives of DHHS 
and DLARA. The blood lead data that DHHS released the previous day was discussed, 
and Dr. Eden Wells provided detailed comment on the data. There was also detailed 
discussion regarding the Revolving Loan Fund and how it might be utilized to help 
address the issue of lead service line replacement. 

On December 4, 2015, representatives of the DEQ (Jim Sygo, Karen Tommasulo, and 
George Krisztian) met with Flint Community Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab. The 
main topic of discussion was a review of the lead in drinking water data obtained to 
date. Superintendent Tawwab was informed that the schools, in general, were all 
following a similar pattern in that the sources of lead appear to be coming primarily from 
fixtures and the adjacent plumbing. Superintendent Tawwab indicated that his office 
has already made the decision to follow all recommendations in the reports. It was also 
agreed that a monthly meeting would be helpful to ensure that the process kept moving 
forward. In addition, there was discussion about a document that the DEQ would create 
that would explain what constituted a part per billion or ppb. A draft document without 
graphics was given to Superintendent Tawwab, and he indicated that the final version 
would be a very helpful aid to parents and students. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• Draft sampling instructions were developed for lead and copper compliance 

sampling, incorporating comments by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). The revised document is being sent back to the EPA for final comment.

• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff to assist with development of a phosphate fact 
sheet. DHHS is the lead on this and will be submitting a revised version to the 
DEQ for final comment. This document is being developed to answer home 
owner questions regarding the safety of the addition of phosphate to the water 
received by the city of Flint from Detroit. 

• Staff from the DEQ provided a “Standby Operations” letter to the city of Flint. 

The purpose of the letter is to define what practices are to be utilized in the event 
of an emergency. 

• Staff from the DEQ followed up with the city of Flint on the status of the 
installation of corrosion control treatment. Pumps were installed on 
November 30, 2015. It is anticipated that the startup of the system will begin 
during the week of December 7, 201 5. 

Other Item : 

Attached is the draft document, “What is a Part per Billion.”

Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

• Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 

o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

• Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings built before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




• The Governor's plan commits that DEQ will test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

• The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

• DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 


2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

• Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 


Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 


3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

• The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

• DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 
approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

• City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

• Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

- A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on 
November 1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid 
time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 

- The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly 
advise the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The 
city paid the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical 
levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 201 5 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 


vwvw.michigan.gov/treasury 




2 


Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, 
and began on September 29, 2015. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 11, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four-month plan listing the priorities to 
be accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1M to $600K. 

- The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

- FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- $700K, and Culture and Recreation- $600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

- Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

- Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates 
remain conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will 
formally update revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year 
financial plan. 

- As the city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in 
October 2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change 
orders. The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to the FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed 
session at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending 
contract. 


Significant Action/Issues 



3 


- The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. 
The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 

- The city’s four-year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the 
second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its 
base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 
17 - FY 20 budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the 
first budget since the EM’s departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and 
will be subject to FRC review and approval. 

- At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the 
Michigan Financial Review Commission Act. 

- The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’s 
corporate city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 
2017. ~ 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 

Recent Developments 

- On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under 
PA 72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM 
was operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 
claiming it was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the 
tests necessary to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

- The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position of 
City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1,2015. $11.21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

- The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 
in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the 
final copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has 



4 


been trying to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these 
developments. 

- The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1, 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four-year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs 
in Year 1. 

- A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court- 
ordered mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 
meeting. 

- The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 

Recent Developments 

- The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

Benton Harbor is hiring the MML to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Lansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Labor in 2014 of a wage claim 
filed with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. 
Department of Labor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the 
settlement: 1) correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from 
the inception of the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission approved 
the settlement at its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the settlement on 
August 11, 2015. 



5 


- The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

- Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

- Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

- On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was 
inaccurate, according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and 
financial plan and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire 
service costs, which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

- Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from S1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

- On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 

Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

- On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a 
previous 35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This 
injunction also requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water 
Fund, prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from 
disconnecting water service for nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction 
could potentially cost the General Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have 
not been successful. Most recently, Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a 
class action. 

- As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 



6 


addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
$1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed 
an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal 
because the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back 
to Genesee County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is 
discussing the need for additional legal representation with the city. 

- Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’s water system after a 
study by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard 
testing shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be 
adding a corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead 
leaching into the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality 
testing to residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

- On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case ( Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 

- The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 
0.6 mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

- As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the 
city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the State 
Tax Commission. The city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation 
of the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the 
installation of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance 
with the federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to 
perform a leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is 
approximately 1/3 complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per 
year. 

On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department 
to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a 
hiring process. 

- The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

- The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 



7 


procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

- If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtraniek 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 

Recent Developments 

- The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into 
sanitary sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 
15, 2015 and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 
2015 and will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review 
options for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

- The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial 
properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvements 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

- On September 14, 2015, the City Council approved Jane Bais-DiSessa for the position of 
Deputy Mayor. The RTAB approved this appointment on September 16, 2015. 

- On July 6, 2016, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the 
lawsuit filed by the city against Ottawa Towers LLC / Phoenix Center. Treasury is 
working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator which could 
free up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On August 19, 2015, the RTAB approved filling the positions of Customer Service 
Representative and Community Relations Specialist. These positions will assist the 
Mayor with community and economic development activities. 

- Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 



8 


- The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme 
Court. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schi mind's elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

- On June 29, 2015, a tentative agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a 
judgment levy on the tax rolls. The levy would run for five years and repay the county 
$4.9M in past due sewer charges. The city is in discussions with Wayne County to 
postpone the levy until July 2016. 

On August 18, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled (Trahey v City of Inkster) that 
the trial court erred in determining the city’s 2012 water and sewer rates were 
unreasonable and ordering the city to issue $2.55M in credits to residents for reduced 
water and sewer rates. The city is evaluating this decision. 

- The city is collaborating with MSHDA and MEDC to seek new housing developments 
and development of several vacant commercial parcels. Inkster Police and the city will 
be utilizing an accumulation of training dollars to train police personnel and staff going 
forward. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved the FY 16 Budget. 

On August 3, 2015, the City Council voted to change the employment status of City 
Manager, Richard Marsh to Special Advisor to the city. The City Council named City

conduct a national search to fill the City Manager’s position. 

- On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

- A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on 
November 1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid 
time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 

- The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly 
advise the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The 
city paid the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical 
levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 201 5 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 


vwvw.michigan.gov/treasury 




2 


Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, 
and began on September 29, 2015. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 11, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four-month plan listing the priorities to 
be accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1M to $600K. 

- The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

- FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- $700K, and Culture and Recreation- $600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

- Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

- Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates 
remain conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will 
formally update revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year 
financial plan. 

- As the city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in 
October 2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change 
orders. The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to the FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed 
session at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending 
contract. 


Significant Action/Issues 



3 


- The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. 
The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 

- The city’s four-year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the 
second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its 
base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 
17 - FY 20 budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the 
first budget since the EM’s departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and 
will be subject to FRC review and approval. 

- At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the 
Michigan Financial Review Commission Act. 

- The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’s 
corporate city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 
2017. ~ 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 

Recent Developments 

- On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under 
PA 72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM 
was operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 
claiming it was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the 
tests necessary to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

- The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position of 
City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1,2015. $11.21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

- The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 
in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the 
final copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has 



4 


been trying to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these 
developments. 

- The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1, 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four-year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs 
in Year 1. 

- A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court- 
ordered mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 
meeting. 

- The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 

Recent Developments 

- The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

Benton Harbor is hiring the MML to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Lansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Labor in 2014 of a wage claim 
filed with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. 
Department of Labor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the 
settlement: 1) correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from 
the inception of the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission approved 
the settlement at its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the settlement on 
August 11, 2015. 



5 


- The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

- Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

- Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the RTAB, 
effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

- On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was 
inaccurate, according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and 
financial plan and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire 
service costs, which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

- Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from S1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

- On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 

Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

- On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a 
previous 35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This 
injunction also requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water 
Fund, prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from 
disconnecting water service for nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction 
could potentially cost the General Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have 
not been successful. Most recently, Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a 
class action. 

- As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 



6 


addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
$1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed 
an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal 
because the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back 
to Genesee County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is 
discussing the need for additional legal representation with the city. 

- Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’s water system after a 
study by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard 
testing shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be 
adding a corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead 
leaching into the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality 
testing to residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

- On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case ( Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 

- The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 
0.6 mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

- As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, the 
city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the State 
Tax Commission. The city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation 
of the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the 
installation of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance 
with the federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to 
perform a leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is 
approximately 1/3 complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per 
year. 

On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department 
to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a 
hiring process. 

- The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

- The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 



7 


procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

- If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtraniek 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 

Recent Developments 

- The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into 
sanitary sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 
15, 2015 and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 
2015 and will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review 
options for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

- The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial 
properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvements 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

- On September 14, 2015, the City Council approved Jane Bais-DiSessa for the position of 
Deputy Mayor. The RTAB approved this appointment on September 16, 2015. 

- On July 6, 2016, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the 
lawsuit filed by the city against Ottawa Towers LLC / Phoenix Center. Treasury is 
working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator which could 
free up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On August 19, 2015, the RTAB approved filling the positions of Customer Service 
Representative and Community Relations Specialist. These positions will assist the 
Mayor with community and economic development activities. 

- Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 



8 


- The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme 
Court. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schi mind's elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT 

Inkster 

Date Executed: February 20, 2012 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Mark Stuhldreher 

Recent Developments 

- On June 29, 2015, a tentative agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a 
judgment levy on the tax rolls. The levy would run for five years and repay the county 
$4.9M in past due sewer charges. The city is in discussions with Wayne County to 
postpone the levy until July 2016. 

On August 18, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled (Trahey v City of Inkster) that 
the trial court erred in determining the city’s 2012 water and sewer rates were 
unreasonable and ordering the city to issue $2.55M in credits to residents for reduced 
water and sewer rates. The city is evaluating this decision. 

- The city is collaborating with MSHDA and MEDC to seek new housing developments 
and development of several vacant commercial parcels. Inkster Police and the city will 
be utilizing an accumulation of training dollars to train police personnel and staff going 
forward. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved the FY 16 Budget. 

On August 3, 2015, the City Council voted to change the employment status of City 
Manager, Richard Marsh to Special Advisor to the city. The City Council named City 
Treasurer, Mark Stuhldreher to the position of Interim City Manager. A search firm will 
conduct a national search to fill the City Manager’s position. 

- On April 20, 2015, the city adopted a working capital reserve policy for the Water and 
Sewer Fund which will provide funds for emergency situations. 

On June 29, 2015, an Order was issued requiring the City Treasurer to approve all 
employment matters with city officials and employees, expenditure of funds, and all 
contracts. 

William Riley is Inkster’s new Police Chief. Mr. Riley’s start date was August 10, 2015. 
The new chief has been reaching out to community groups and the neighborhoods, and is 
fully engaged.

River Rouge 

Date Executed: December 15, 2009 
Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- A fire union collective bargaining agreement was approved in March, resulting in a 
reduction in healthcare costs. 

The city adopted its FY 16 Budget on May 19, 2015. The budget is balanced and has a 
beginning fund balance of $1,967,613. The city has prepared a proposed five-year budget 
that shows a deficit in FY 1 8 to FY 20 unless additional revenues can be found. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The Township Board voted to extend the Consent Agreement Consultant’s contract 
through March 31, 2016. 

The Consent Agreement Consultant, Treasury, and the Michigan State Police met with 
Oak Park City Manager on September 21, 2015 to discuss the city providing police 
services to the township. 

- A six-month plan has been developed by Consent Agreement Consultant Robert Burgess, 
listing the priorities for the next several months. Treasury has been offering assistance to 
the consultant in implementing the plan’s priorities. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 4, 2015, voters approved a renewal of 4.5 mills for general operations. 

On June 17, 2015, an Order was issued granting the Consultant broad authority to 

approve expenditures made by the township and ensure that obligations are being paid. 
The Order also gives the Consultant authority to invest the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets with MERS. 

- The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township. 

- The township audit was completed. Auditors recommend the township submit a Deficit 

Elimination Plan for 2014, select a firm to advise the township on financial matters, and 
perform an inventory of assets. 

Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 Budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. On May 20, 
2015, an Order was issued requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 
prior to authorization. 

Wayne County 



10 


Recent 

- On September 15, 2015, the County Deputy Chief Financial Officer submitted a cash 
flow forecast as required by the Consent Agreement. It is under review by Treasury 
staff. 

AFSCME Council 25 attempts to block any changes to the terms and conditions of 
employment has failed at the state courts. On September 15, 2015, AFSCME filed a 
Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent changes to the terms and 
conditions of employment in Federal Court but it has not yet been granted. The County 
has filed a request with the United States District Court to deny the Temporary 
Restraining Order and to dismiss the lawsuit. No decision has been made. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 21, 2015, the County Board approved the Consent Agreement negotiated 
between the County Executive and State Treasurer. 

On June 10, 2015, the county reached a settlement with retirees on healthcare. The 
county will no longer provide health insurance but will instead provide a stipend to 
retirees. This will result in a savings of $20M annually. 

- The county’s annual structural General Fund deficit is approximately $52M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

- The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $53M in General Fund savings, 
$25M of which comes from changes to pension and healthcare benefits for active 
employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

Recent Developments 

On August 11, 2015, a report was issued by Meadowbrook Insurance on the progress of 
reducing the city’s healthcare costs. When successfully implemented after October 1, 
2015, the $1.4M annual cost of healthcare could be reduced to $630K. 

- On August 24, 2015, City Council gave conditional approval to the settlement agreement 
between the city and DWSD over past due water and sewer bills. However, the city is 
waiting for a response from DWSD on other issues. 

- The second phase of emergency loans is under discussion. It would consist of 
approximately $4.7M to restructure the city’s three outstanding emergency loans and 
$11. 5M to refinance outstanding debt. 

The city has purchased the first quantity of water meters at a cost of $343K. Meter 
installation is underway. 

- Wade Trim, the firm hired by Highland Park to manage the water and sewer operations, 
processed the first regular water and sewer bills to customers on August 13, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



On June 29, 2015, City Council approved a substantial increase in water and sewer rates 
which will allow the city to Hind water and sewer operations. 

On July 6, 2015, Wade Trim began duties to operate and maintain the water and sewer 
systems. 

Louis Schimmel was hired on June 29, 2015, to provide consulting services regarding 
water and sewer issues. 

On July 31, 2015, the water and sewer amnesty program expired. City Administrator 
Cathy Square stated the city will work with customers to settle their past due accounts. 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council approved a resolution requesting MOOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under state jurisdiction in the city. 
The City Administrator has indicated that the city has filed suit against both MDOT and 
Wayne County over storm water. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a consultant’s recommendation for an amnesty 
plan for residential customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. The consultant 
has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, the city could 
collect $2.08M. The city extended the amnesty plan until July 31, 2015 to allow more 
time for customers to pay past due accounts. 

The city’s liabilities total $99. 9M. Some major components are: $55. 3M debt, including 
$20. 7M owed to the DWSD, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits 
(OPEB).

Frequently Asked Questions: 

Water Lead Levels in the City of Flint 
September 2015 


How can lead get into drinking water? 

Lead detections in Flint drinking water exist at the home level. Sampling at the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant has shown no lead in its treated water. However, this 
contaminant leaches into water from a home’s lead service lines, lead solder, and 
leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. 

Does the city meet federal drinking water standards for lead and copper? 

Yes, the city is meeting state and federal guidelines for lead and copper. 

The City of Flint has regularly monitored for lead and copper since federal law began 
requiring it in 1991 . 

When the City changed water sources in May 2014, state and federal law required the 
city to sample for lead and copper for a full year to determine how the water may be 
interacting with residential lead plumbing to increase lead levels. While the city’s results 
show residential lead levels below the federal threshold for immediate response 
activities, Flint is moving quickly to optimize corrosion control measures in its water 
system. 

Some individual homes showed high numbers for lead. Isn’t that a concern? 

For the homeowner, yes it is. There is no “safe” level for lead, and while the leading 
cause of lead poisoning around the country is lead paint, any source of lead ingestion is 
worthy of concern. 

But the State and federal guidelines for lead and copper acknowledge an important 
reality: Any home that has a lead service connection or lead plumbing will impart some 
varying amount of lead into the home’s water. The only way to eliminate lead in a home 
water system is to remove lead plumbing or replace lead service connections to the city 
system. 

The lead and copper rule requires the local operator to sample dozens, sometimes 
hundreds of homes in the service area to get a general sense of how the water supply is 
interacting with lead plumbing and service connections. The tests are done specifically 
at homes with lead service connections. Individual results vary and all participants are 


i 



Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure? 

The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout 
Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint. 

Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint 
changed its water source (May 2014 - April 201 5) showed no significant change in the 
pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data 
suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an 
increase in lead exposure throughout the community. 

How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem? 

Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90 th percentile calculation. If more 
than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a 
violation. It triggers other requirements which could include public notification, additional 
water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment. 

While some of Flint’s individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action 
level, compliance is based on the 90 ,h percentile of samples. The City of Flint’s 90 th 
percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 201 1 , and 15 parts 
per billion in 1992, but never exceeded the action level. 

The two most recent sampling periods, in 2014 and 2015, were 6 parts per billion and 
1 1 parts per billion, respectively. 

Did the city use every sample they got back? 

Sampling requirements for lead and copper are designed to target the most common 
pathways to lead ingestion in homes with the least protection. The sample must be 
collected from a commonly used kitchen or bathroom tap, and in accordance with the 
provided sampling instructions. Homes that employ filtration or additional treatment 
cannot be included. Samples must also be collected within the established monitoring 
period. 

I have a lead service connection or lead plumbing. What should I do? 

Replacement is the only way to eliminate lead exposure. However, here are some 
interim steps homeowners can take to reduce it: 

Flush pipes before drinking, and only use cold water for consumption. 

The more time water has been sitting in your home’s pipes, the more lead it may 
contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer, 
"flush" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This 
could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home, 
such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer. 

Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making 
baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels of lead. 


2 



Who is responsible for replacement of leaded materials? 

Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials 
within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility. The City of Flint owns the service 
pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility. 
This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house 
is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner. 

Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines? 

Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make 
the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated 
effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels. 

What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment? 

The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal 
corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years. 

However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized 
Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months. 

What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year? 

The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior 
to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by 
KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and 
copper sampling every six months. Additionally, the city’s water treatment plant will 
continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment. 

How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint? 

The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these 
connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it 
would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work. 

What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house? 

Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to 
$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as 
well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered. 

With more than 15,000 lead service lines at an estimated average cost of $4,000 for 
each replacement, total cost could be $60 million or more.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 


• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

• MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

• All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

• Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

• Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 




The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 




WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

I saw in the press this am that DHHS announced 
yesterday that water filters would start being given 
out today. This should have come internally with 
more detail. I had press questions last night. 


Overall, we should have a daily report on Flint until 
our recommendations are fully implemented. 


For example: 

1 . What are the water test results from the public 
schools? 

2. How many free test have been requested? How 
many have been done? How many remain and how 
long have they been waiting? What are the results - 
no lead, lead consistent with history, higher levels? 

3. How many filters have been distributed? How 
many unfulfilled requests? 

4. New blood test results? Especially in the two zip 
codes. 

5. Analysis of tech advisory group

6. Analysis of the GLWA vs. Flint River vs. KWA.

Flint Water Update from DEQ 

The Flint Drinking Water Action Plan was announced on October 2, 2015. It included the following: 

• Testing in Flint public schools immediately 

• Offered free water testing to Flint residents 

• Provided free water filters to residents with concerns or who are included in state assistance programs 

• Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes 

• Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system 

• Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines 

• Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline 

• Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

• Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint drinking water public health advisor 

• Boosted a comprehensive lead education program 

Testing in Flint Public Schools Immediately 

Samples were taken on October 2 and were received at DEQ. laboratory over the weekend. Test results to date indicate 
37 samples tested, 4 of which exceeded a federal action level, and 1 of those 4 was a significant outlier. We will be 
compiling detailed information about which schools and area codes the test results came from and will be providing that 
information in our next update. 

We have met with DFHHS, and we are working on developing response protocols, a communications plan, and guidance 
for schools when this data is reported. 

Offered Free Water Testing to Flint Residents 

We have received 4 sets of samples from Flint that represent individual residents. We will be compiling the total 
number and the results of those samples and reporting in a future report. 

Provided Free Water Filters to Residents with Concerns or Who are Included in State Assistance Programs 

DHHS held organizational meetings in Flint on October 5, and filter distribution by DHHS started on October 6. Nick Lyon 
in DHHS is taking the lead in filter distribution. 

Expanding Health Exposure Testing of Individual Homes 

Dr. Wells and Dan Wyant have been in conversations about a protocol for exposure testing. Dr. Wells will take the lead 
on developing the protocol. 

Accelerating Corrosion Controls in the Flint Drinking Water System 

A conference call was held with U.S. EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman and national corrosion control 
experts. We asked two questions: 

1. Which is a safer water source - DWSD or Flint River? 

2. If you don't have an opinion on the safer source, what criteria should we use for an evaluation? 

EPA staff would not commit to a preference, but their evaluation of the criteria clearly lead to the conclusion that DWSD 
was a safer water source. EPA committed to submitting technical assistance to the Safe Drinking Water Technical 
Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) meeting, which will be held on October 7 at 2:00 p.m. in Flint City Hall. 

DEQ met with the Flint Mayor, the city manager, and their water staff. Flint agreed to expediting corrosion controls. We 
discussed the agenda for the Advisory Committee meeting. The Advisory Committee will be asked to evaluate two 
respective water sources at their Wednesday meeting. 

We expect the Advisory Committee to recommend the water source that would address not only lead safety but also 
other water safety issues. 


Accelerating Water System Improvements to Address Replacing Lead Service Lines 



Conversations with Congressman Kildee and EPA have clarified the state would be allowed to use Drinking Water 
Revolving Loan funds to replace private drinking water service lines. Senator Ananich has been approached to introduce 
language clarifying the state's authority. 

Expediting the Completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority Pipeline 

Dan Wyant has talked to Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright. Mr. Wright has provided a list of issues that 
would help expedite the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. They include truck weight and frost 
law exemptions, talent identification, and expediting permits. 

Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee 

EPA has appointed their national technical expert to the Advisory Committee, and we have appointed Alfred Franzblau, 
M.D., Professor of Environmental Health Services, University of Michigan, to the Advisory Committee. 

Named Dr. Eden Wells as the Flint Drinking Water Public Health Advisor 

Boosted a Comprehensive Lead Education Program 

Other Updates 

• Dan Wyant was interviewed on 10/6 by CBS Evening News during filter distribution in Flint. Questions asked: 

o Was it a mistake to go to Flint River water? 

Answer: We draw water from the surface waters; we treat it to safe drinking water standards. At issue 
is lead exposure. Lead exposure must be addressed. Actions are being taken to address the issue, 
o Did you put kids at risk? 

Answer: Lead exposure is a serious issue, and steps need to be taken to limit lead exposure, 
o Why did it take so long? 

Answer: DEQ has been there from the beginning addressing the issue of Flint water. Recent tests justify 
and require the actions taken. Action steps address short-term, intermediate, and long-term lead issues 
to ensure public safety and confidence of the drinking water. 

• Dan Wyant also spoke to the Governor about Flint funding needs. A meeting is scheduled for October 7 at 8:00 
a.m. to further discuss proposals. 

• What we are telling Flint citizens is: 

o Have your water tested 

o Use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and preparing formula 
o Run water before use if it has not been used for several hours 
o Obtain a water filter approved for lead removal 
o Purchase lead-free plumbing components 
o Remove entire lead service lines 

Flint Water Update from Communications Team 

• CBS Evening News was in Flint Monday and Tuesday with coverage slated to air during tonight's 6 p.m news 
block nationally. Story isn't likely to be great, but should hopefully be fair and balanced. Will have ties into race, 
poverty, emergency management, and what state and locals did and knew when and how situation was 
handled. 

• We helped arrange interviews with DEQ Director Dan Wyant and DHHS' Cheryl Thompson, who is the deputy 
director for the Department's field services, an African American and also a Flint resident. They did those 
interviews from the now up and running water filter distribution centers at one of the two DHHS Flint offices. 

• They also did interviews with local Flint media. 

• Majority of media coverage both in Flint locally and statewide today to date has been on free water filter 
distribution so has been generally more positive. 

• Sen. Ananich was again urging immediate switch to Detroit water with comment "To me, the cost-benefit 
analysis that has cost on one side and brain damage for kids on the other — it's incomprehensible." 

• Erin Brockovich did an exclusive interview for WJRTTV 12 that's supposed to air tonight in the 5 p.m. news and 
the teaser is "one of the worst situations she's ever seen."

Talking points: 

• Protecting the health and safety of our residents in Flint and across Michigan is always our top priority. 

o All Michigan residents need access to safe, clean water 

• That's why today, in consultation with health and water experts in our state agencies, I'm advocating 
reconnecting the Flint drinking water with the Great Lakes Water Authority. 

• I'm recommending to my partners in the Legislature that the state government provide $6 million of the needed 
$12 million to reconnect with authority. 

o The Flint city government has agreed to cover $2 million of this cost, and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation is generously offered to donate $4 million. 

o The Michigan Department of FHealth and Fluman Services and the Department of Environmental Quality 
today also is committing an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water. 

• What you are seeing here today is a community coming together to work toward solving a problem. 

o I appreciate the assistance of Mayor Walling, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

o This is a collaborative approach, and I appreciate that community organizations including the United 
Way and come forward to assist. 




Today's announcement in an important step as we move forward together, 
o But it is not our first step, nor will it be our last. 



• This announcement builds on work we've already set in place. 

• That includes $4.2 million in state grants and loan restructuring to help identify and fix 
infrastructure problems. 

• State agencies have been working closely with Flint leaders and the community for more 
than a year. 

There will be more to do. 

o Flint has an aging water infrastructure system with challenges that we - together - will continue to 
address. 

We will continue to test Flint schools for lead levels in drinking water, 
o Schools across the state might also have questions. 

o The Department of Environmental Quality will work with districts across the state to provide testing. 

• Districts can send water samples and paperwork and the nominal charge. (It costs $26 per 
sample). 


The steps outlined in the comprehensive action plan are still in effect. 



FAQs for Media Q&As 


Switch to Great Lakes Water Authority 

What finally pushed the state to this decision? 

This was the City's request, and the Governor supports it, based on several key factors: 

In the near term, DWSD water will be easier to manage. It comes from a more stable source than the river, it is fully 
optimized for corrosion control, and it is clear that residents of Flint have more confidence in this water source. 

Will this solve Flint's water crisis? 

In combination with the other short term, intermediate term and long-term steps outlined last week, this move 
represents a big step forward. Flint still has serious system maintenance challenges it must address. 

If you're saying residents will still have lead because of their plumbing, does that mean every other city in this state 
has a lead problem? 

Many areas of the state have lead in their infrastructure mix. 

Where's the state getting the money to fund this? 

We have submitted a formal request to lawmakers via the appropriations process. 

Where's the city getting the money to fund this? 

The city is contributing all it can, and is getting assistance for its match from the Mott Foundation. 

How long will the switch take? 

The switch will be completed by the City and Great lakes Water Authority, but our understanding is that it can be 
accomplished in the very near term once the arrangements are complete. 

How long will it take before Detroit's corrosion controls provide protection for Flint? 

It will take some time for the corrosion control additives to build on pipe walls throughout the system. Estimates vary. 
The state can assure we will commence monitoring of the system early 2016 and report results as we get them to keep 
the community updated. 

Why do residents still need to use filters and bottled water? 

The filters and bottled water are responsible precautions for any resident concerned about lead exposure. 

Do the filters actually work? We've been hearing they don't protect for lead. 

Yes, the filters work. They are all certified for lead removal by the National Sanitation Foundation. 

The filters are only good for 100 gallons. What happens when they are used up? 

They will need to be replaced. And residents can get a new filter. 

What about restaurants? 

What's going to be done about lead service lines? 

Long term, this is the only permanent solution to lead exposure. The state has committed to helping the city accomplish 
this goal long term. 




Do you wish you'd made this switch sooner? 

We support the City's decision. We can't look backward. We feel the state has responded quickly and effectively as 
information has surfaced, been investigated and verified. While the City of Flint is, right now, in compliance with the 
federal Lead and 

Copper Rule, we recognize there is a disparity between surveillance testing and other testing happening in the 
community that we need to better understand and we are working on developing our knowledge. 

Schools testing 

What do these results say? 

The results say we need to further investigate Flint schools and help the schools find clearer causes for some the results 
we got. 

Any theories about what's going on? 

It is possible there are specific points in the plumbing that have lead components which need to be replaced, but we 
can't say anything definitively until we perform an investigation at each school. 

Do the schools have lead service lines? If not, why are they getting such high results? 

The schools we tested initially do not have lead service lines. There are a few possible reasons why lead is being 
detected at specific points in the buildings and not others. When we know things definitively, we will make the 
information public. 

How long do the schools have to stay on bottled water? Just until the switch to Detroit, or longer term? 

We are encouraging the schools to continue their current protective measures as a precaution until we can get into the 
buildings and get more answers. 

Why did you only test 13 schools? 

That was what the Flint Public Schools requested. 

What happens to other schools? 

We will test all the schools in Flint if they request it. 

What about the schools that can't afford to update their entire plumbing systems? 

This is why we are having plumbing assessments completed. There is no way to know yet what each building will 
require. 

How confident are you in your testing? You've got results all over the map. 

We are confident that our testing meets the requirements for the federal Lead and Copper Rule, which is surveillance 
monitoring. The bigger question is whether surveillance monitoring meets the public health protection standards that 
Lead Exposure Testing methods do. The EPA is working on that question now, and we are engaged in that dialogue. 

What do you mean by "health exposure testing"? What are you doing next? 


The 90 th percentile of your results is still below 15 ppb. Does that make you more or less confident in your testing and 
in your protocols? 



It makes us confident that the testing protocol delivers consistent results. But again, it does raise questions about 
whether this testing method shows what people think it does or what they really want to know, which is actual lead 
exposure from lead plumbing in a home. 

Any idea how long kids have been exposed to lead? Was it before the move to the Flint River? 

That is possible. We don't know. 

How does the state bring this new information into the broader picture of kids' lead exposure across the state? 



Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points for Director Lyon and Dr. Wells 


Water Filters 

• Our first action item is to work closely with our public and private partners to provide water filters to Flint 
residents and MDHHS clients. 

• To meet this priority, the governor identified one million dollars in state funding to purchase water filters for 
Flint residents. 

• The Brita SAFF-100 filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the NSF/ANSI 53 standards 
for drinking water treatment units. 

• The Brita faucet filtration system we are distributing are National Sanitation Foundation certified to reduce lead 
in drinking water. 

• Free water filters are available to current Michigan Department of Health and Human Services clients and Flint 
residents who are on the Flint water system at four locations: 

o Flint residents who are not current MDHHS clients should visit one of two Genesee County Community 
Action Resource Department offices to obtain a filter. 

■ at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint 

o Current MDHHS clients in the city of Flint should visit their local MDHHS office 

■ At 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 

• Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

• Extended hours are being offered at the Lippincott facility only, and will run until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, 
and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The other three locations will maintain 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. operating hours, 
Monday through Friday, for filter pick up. 

• Given the questions and concerns regarding the change in water source in Flint, MDHHS authorized the use of 
emergency services funding to provide water filters for MDHHS clients receiving assistance in the city of Flint. 

• This funding will support active Family Independence Program (FIP), Food Assistance Program (FAP), Child 
Development and Care (CDC), State Disability Assistance (SDA), State Disability Assistance (SDA), or Social 
Security Insurance (SSI) recipients so that they can obtain filters that are National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) 
certified to remove lead and ANSI Standard 53. 

• MDHHS currently serves approximately 25,000 households in Flint. 


School Testing and Results 

• The state today also released the first results from its free lead screening program in schools. 

• Out of 13 buildings tested, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 
parts per billion. 

• However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and MDHHS toxicologists will work with DEO. to conduct 
further testing. 

• Schools on the Flint water system should continue using filtered or bottled water to protect against potential 
lead exposure. 

Background Information 

• Initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in Flint have followed an expected 
seasonal trend; due to small numbers further analysis was initiated. 




• While this analysis of blood lead levels in Flint as a whole remains true, after a comprehensive and detailed 
review down to the zip code level, we have found that the state analysis is consistent with that presented by 
Hurley. 

• Director Lyon is working closely with DEQ and the administration to take active steps to reduce all potential lead 
exposures in Flint, and across the state. 

• Our Chief Medical Executive has been in communication with the lead investigator at Hurley Children's Hospital, 
and we continue to work with Hurley, the city of Flint, local and state leaders to verify and analyze data trends. 

• Zip code-level data does show that there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in specific 
communities. 

o This does not conclusively mean that the water source change is the sole cause of the increase, but data 
does show an association. 

o There is an increased proportion of children with elevated Blood Levels (ELBs) in several zip codes, 
particularly 03 and 04. These appear to have increased over the last 1.5 years. 

o Lead exposure can occur from a number of different sources (such as paint, gasoline, solder, and 
consumer products) and through different pathways (such as air, food, water, dust, and soil). 

o Although there are several exposure sources, lead-based paint is still the most widespread and 
dangerous high-dose source of lead exposure for young children in the US and Michigan. 

• We reviewed MDHHS statewide data using the same methodology used by Hurley, looking at our numbers by 
zip code and age ranges, and filtering out non-Flint children. 

• Routine surveillance of blood lead levels does not analyze data down to the zip code level. Detailed analysis like 
this occurs when there is reason to focus in on precise locations or populations. 

• MDHHS is working closely with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Hurley Children's Hospital, 
the Genesee County Health Department, and community organizations to initiate further action steps. 

• We understand that cost may be a barrier to following the recommendations for drinking water, which is why 
NSF certified filters are being distributed to residents on the Flint water system free of charge. 

• MDHHS is recommending that residents follow the Public Health Advisory issued by the Genesee County Health 
Department, as well as take further steps to reduce exposures to all forms of lead in and around their homes. 


MDHHS Stats and Facts 

• 'High Risk' Zip codes (48503 and 48504) 

o Blood lead level rates among children under six years of age in the high risk zip codes (48503, 48504) 
were 2.7 times higher than the rest of Genesee County before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o After the switch to Flint River Water, rates in the high risk Zip codes were 3.2 times that of the rest of 
Genesee County. 

• Other Zip codes in Flint 

o Rates of elevated blood lead levels among children under six years of age in other parts of the city of 
Flint were 2 times that of the rest of Genesee County before the switch to Flint River Water. 

o The magnitude of the elevated rate remained roughly the same during the period after the water source 
switch. 

• Lead abatement through MDHHS was federally funded up until FY14 when Michigan began providing additional 
funds to abate homes. 

• In FY14, $1.25M General Fund was added. In FY15, General Fund was bumped up to $1.75M and FY16, General 
Fund remains at $1.75M. 



Reducing and Removing Lead Exposure 


• In housing built before 1978, it can be assumed that the paint has lead unless tests show otherwise. 

• Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint. 

• Children and pregnant women should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. 
They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is 
completed. 

• Create barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed, you 
should clean and isolate all sources of lead. 

o Close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply 
temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, to cover holes in walls or to block children's 
access to other sources of lead. 

• Regularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or 
exterior soil. Both are known lead sources. 

• Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, 
you should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. 

o Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, 
windows should be shut to prevent abrasion of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash. 

• Take off shoes when entering the house to prevent bringing lead-contaminated soil in from outside. 

• Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Plant grass on areas of bare 
soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. 

o Until the bare soil is covered, move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the 

house. If you have a sandbox, cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. 
That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste. 

• Avoid using makeup, containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or liquids that are not shown to 
be lead free. 

• Remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children. 

• Use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Hot water is more likely to 
contain higher levels of lead. Most of the lead in household water usually comes from the plumbing in your 
house, not from the local water supply. 

• Shower and change clothes after finishing a task that involves working with lead-based products such as stained 
glass, making bullets, or using a firing range. 


WIC Children 

• There are 855 infants participating in WIC in Flint. 

• We are working with partners at the United Way to ensure that WIC families have access to water filters and 
bottled water. 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official source of unsanitary water 
supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to-feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if 
they are eligible. 

• Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water. 



Flint water action plan - next steps 
Communications & Outreach Plan 


Situation overview: 

Water and concerns about lead levels in the city of Flint have been escalating since the city moved to the Flint River as 
its source of water after switching from DWSD in the spring of 2014 with local plans to move to a new water authority - 
the Karegnondi Water Authority or KWA - slated to be online in June 2016. Numerous tests have shown the water 
overall to be safe with non-detect lead levels when leaving Flint water treatment plan and below widely recognized 
federal action levels (15 ppb) in most surveillance monitoring. However, like many communities across the state and 
country, Flint's infrastructure is aging and hasn't been updated in decades, facing outdated lead service connections and 
lead pipes in individual homes. Some water tests have indicated definite elevated lead levels within some homes, 
neighborhoods and zip codes, with some children in those same areas also experiencing elevated lead levels, causing 
great concern for all parties. 

Race, poverty and local governance (with city's history of emergency managers) have all been railed as issues or 
allegations, adding to the challenges. 

Given all factors involved, it has been deemed prudent and best for public health and restoring confidence in water 
system to temporarily switch back to Detroit water, now governed by an entity called the Great Lakes Water Authority, 
as the city's water source until the new KWA is completed. A specie:! technical advisory committee comprised of public 
health and drinking water experts has concurred and recommended such a path. The cost to do so is estimated at about 
$12M over nine months. The state is proposing to cover about half of the cost with the city ($2M) and community 
organizations (C.S. Mott Foundation at $4M) pledging to cover the balance. 

Goals/obiectives: 

• Ensure governor and state focus is on protecting public health and ensuring safe, accessible drinking water and all 
the action steps that are being taken to help ensure those two priorities. 

• Minimize and diffuse finger pointing and tension between all stakeholders. 

• Effective, concise communication that makes it clear for both residents and schools what next steps are and that 
state is committed to doing everything it can to help address situation in partnership and collaboration with city and 
community leaders. 

• Restore confidence in Flint water. 

• Convey shared responsibility to address.

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water 
provides best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 


FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great 
Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide half, or $6 million, of 
the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority. The Flint city government will provide $2 
million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation will donate $4 million. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. “The technical experts helping 
the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority 
provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result 
of people coming together to solve a problem. I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect 
with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come 
together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state 
laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure 
monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting 
of Flint’s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is 
expected to cost about $1 .3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed 
next summer.

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health 
benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from 
large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, 
the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using 
phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city’s problem with lead 
service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the 
phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in 
their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced. 

INSERT MOTT FOUNDATION QUOTE HERE 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out 
steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of 
faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead 
exposure. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road 
MDHHS office locations. For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance 
programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four 
locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents 
who have questions about proper installation. At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will 
be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. on Saturday. 


Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap 
and running the water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, 
drinking and especially mixing baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and 
homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings 
exceeded the federal action level of 1 5 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further 
testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are 
advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head 
Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden: 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water In one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich., have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking ’water. 
For this reason, ! am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 
particularly for young children. 


Although the city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have 
conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 
level, there are significant questions about the efficacy of their testing. In fact, Dr. Marc Edwards 
of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group of health professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water In Flint is unsafe to drink. 



Thus, I am requesting resources from your agency to provide dean drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can determine when the water will he safe to drink and a 
long-term solution can be implemented. 

This is a serious health issue, particularly for young children, aid until the water is demonstrated 
to be safe, immediate action must be taken to ensure Flint’s residents have potable drinking 
water. 

1 look forward to working with you and thank you for your immediate attention.

Ms. Gina McCarthy 

Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency 
1 101 A 

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, M.W. 

Washington, D.C. 20460 


Dear Administrator McCarthy: 

My office has reached out to both the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations 
at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
to determine if there are any statutory limitations on states to forgive the principal on loans made 
through the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SDWSRF) program. After talking to 
both of these offices, there seems to he a difference in legal opinion between the two 
interpretations as to whether forgiveness of principal is statutorily allowed, and I am requesting 
further clarification. 

The City of Flint, Mich,, located in my district, continues to endure prolonged and severe 
financial stress due to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs, resulting in population loss 
and an erosion of its tax base. In an effort, to improve the city’s financial stability, Flint decided 
to end its 50-plus~year affiliation with the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department in April 
of 2013. Instead, Flint would become a partner in the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to 
bring raw water from Lake Huron to the city. 

The water contract between the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department and Flint was 
terminated in May of 2G14,The KWA, however, will not be able to provide water to the city until 
its pipeline from Flint to Lake Huron is completed at the end of 2016. To fill the gap in service 
until the KWA is completed, Flint has turned to the Flint River as its current source for raw 
water. The Flint River has proven to have an inconsistent quality because of high levels of 
organic matter, Flint water officials have used high levels of trihaiomethanes to treat the 
occasional elevated levels of organic matter in tire water. On December 16, 2014, the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality cited the city for being in violation of water standards 
determined by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) due to high levels of trihaiomethanes. In 
accordance with the SDWA, a cautionary notice about the citation was subsequently sent to 



Since its citation, Flint has engaged local and state leaders to find a solution for the poor quality 
of the water. On February 3, 2015, the state gave the city close to $2 million to hire consultants 
to assess the condition and find leaks in the water infrastructure system. While this binding is a 
step in the fight direction, it is not nearly enough to significantly improve the water quality. 

This background on Flint’s water situation is to point out that the SDWA is intended to improve 
drinking water in America’s cities, such as Flint, by creating water quality standards and funding 
the SDWSRF to invest in water infrastructure. In addition to the high levels of trihalomethanes, 
the poor condition of water infrastructure in Flint, regardless of the water’s source, contributes to 
discolored and poor tasting water. Furthermore, Flint currently suffers an over 35 percent loss 
ratio of water between the treatment plant and the end user. In the past, Flint has benefited from 
the SDWSRF and currently has close to $22 million in outstanding loans from it that the city has 
used to repair the water system. The financial stress of making payments on these loans, 
however, has prevented the city from making the necessary ongoing investments to its water 
infrastructure. 

To decrease the burden of these loans, on January 18, 201 5, Flint requested that the state of 
Michigan, as the responsible party in appropriating funds from the SDWSRF to local 
governments, forgive part of the principal The state responded that forgiving the principal is not 
an option as the state does not have the authority to do so. 

In response to the state’s reply, on February 10, 2015, my staff reached out to the Office of 
Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at the ERA to ask if they were aware of any 
statutory language that prevents principal forgiveness of loans made under the SDWSRF. On 
February 25, 2015, the EFA responded that they “could find ... no provision that would allow a 
state to [forgive an existing loan made from a Safe Drinking Water Act state revolving fund],” 

On February' 23, 2015, my staff also reached out to the CRS for their legal opinion on this 
matter. Although they could not find any precedent for doing so, the CRS did find two instances 
in statute that, in their opinion, allows states to forgive the principal on loans made through the 
SDWSRF. 

First, SDWA sec, 1452(4X1)? 42 USC 30Oj-l 2(d)(1), states ™ “Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, in any case in which the State makes a loan pursuant to subsection 
(a)(2) of this section to a disadvantaged community ,, , , the State may provide additional 
subsidization (including forgiveness of principal).” 

Second, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. Law 113*235, 
states on page 296 ~ “Provided further, [t]hat not less than 20 percent hut not more than 30 
percent of the funds made available under this title to each State for Drinking Water State 
Revolving Fund capitalization grants shall be used by the State to provide additional subsidy to 
eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or 
any combination of these), and shall be so used by the State only where such funds are provided 
as initial financing for an eligible recipient or to buy, refinance, or restructure foe debt 
obligations of eligible recipients only where such debt was incurred on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act; . . . T 



The difference in opinion between EPA and CRS has created ambiguity for the affected parties. 
The ability of states to forgive portions of the principal on loans made through the SDWSRF 
could have a significant impact on the financial state of Flint and many other distressed 
municipalities across the county. I would appreciate clarification from you on what, according to 
EPA’s interpretation of the law, statutoril y prevents states from forgiving the principal on loans 
made under the SDWSRF. 


Due to critical nature of the water quality in Flint and the impact that loan forgiveness could 
have on improving the quality of the water, I ask for your prompt attention to this matter. 


Sincerely, 



Dan Kildee

PRELIMINARY DRAFT 



FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS: 


WHAT DID WE FIND? 

1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the last round of 
community lead and copper testing. 

2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb action level. 
There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary (which had two samples 
exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The 
sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than the other samples at 101 PPB. 

3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more detailed sampling 
needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within each respective school's plumbing 
can be identified and addressed. 

WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN? 

1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system within each school. 

2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with schools to implement 
these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to address this issue. 

3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist schools in 
conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems. 

WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL? 

1) DEQ's protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States. 

2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed intervals to identify 
levels of lead and its likely source. 

3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive plan to address 
issues on a site specific basis. 


HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND? 

1) Schools should continue protective measures that are currently in place until a complete study can be conducted at 
each school. This includes the continued use of bottled water for consumption purposes. 

2) We will be reaching out to schools to schedule a complete evaluation, assessment and sampling, of their plumbing 
systems. 



Drinking Water Regulations for Monitoring of Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers 


There is no federal or Michigan law requiring sampling of drinking water in schools that receive water from other public 
water systems, although schools that have their own water supply are subject to regulation and sampling as non- 
community public water systems. Schools served by a public water system may be included as a sampling site (i.e., tap) 
for a public water system's lead and copper monitoring program if there are insufficient single-family homes that 
qualify. There are no federal requirements for more extensive testing. 

The 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) required EPA to develop regulations to control for lead in 
drinking water. The Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), issued in 1991, is focused on controlling corrosion within the 
distribution system that delivers water to customers. The 1986 SDWA Amendments also required that only lead-free 
materials be used in new plumbing and in plumbing repairs. 

In 1988, the SDWA was further amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), to reduce the exposure of lead 
to children in schools and child care facilities. The LCCA prohibited the sale of any drinking water cooler that is not lead- 
free and required that: 

• the EPA identify each brand and model of drinking water cooler, indicating which are lead free and which have a lead- 
lined tank and distribute the list to states (SDWA Sec. 1463), 

• the Consumer Product Safety Commission order that manufacturers and importers of all drinking water coolers 
identified as having a lead-lined tank repair, replace, or recall and provide a refund for such coolers (SDWA Sec. 1462), 

• the EPA publish a guidance document and testing protocol to assist states in determining the source and degree of 
lead contamination in school drinking water (SDWA Sec. 1464), and 

• states establish programs to assist schools and child care facilities to test for and remedy lead contamination 
problems, with public availability of results of such testing (SDWA Sec. 1464(d)). 

As a result of a 1996 court decision, States are not required to establish testing programs. In its decision, the Fifth Circuit 
held that provisions in section 1464(d) were unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
because they directly compelled the state to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program and provided no options 
for the State to decline the program. The decision did not, however, restrict states from developing and carrying out 
their own programs to assist schools. 

In 1989 and subsequent years, EPA released guidance and information to inform states and school systems how to test 
for and reduce the risk of lead exposure in school drinking water. EPA's guidance provides a protocol for testing water 
in schools and recommends that schools take action at fixtures where the lead concentration exceeds 20 ppb. This 
concentration differs from the 15 ppb action level that public water systems are required to follow. The 20 ppb action 
level is based on a smaller sample collection volume of 250 milliliters (ml) and is designed to pinpoint specific 
fountains and outlets that require attention. 

In 1990, Michigan did provide schools and licensed child care centers with information to assist in testing and remedying 
potential lead contamination of their drinking water as required by the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988. This 
information included a sampling protocol and guidance on flushing their system to minimize lead exposure. 

In 2004, EPA surveyed states to determine what additional programs may exist to control exposure to lead in drinking 
water at schools and child care centers. Forty-nine states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the Navajo Nation 
responded. Only 16 respondents indicated they have or will conduct special sampling or studies to target lead exposure 
at schools and child care centers. Michigan has not included any additional sampling programs or studies. However, 
some local agencies have conducted voluntary programs. For example, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation funded a program 
implemented by the Calhoun County Health Department that sampled schools in Battle Creek. In Michigan's response 
to this EPA survey, we included a recommendation for EPA to allow schools to be considered as a primary LCR 
monitoring site so that more information about lead levels in schools would become available. However, no changes in 
sampling criteria have occurred to date. 



In 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the EPA, the Department of Education, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Water Works Association, the Association of Metropolitan Water 
Agencies, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National Association of Water Companies and the 
National Rural Water Association to facilitate actions that reduce children's exposure to lead from drinking water at 
schools and child care facilities. 

Across the country and in Michigan, most schools and child care facilities receive water from other community water 
systems. However, those schools that have their own source of drinking water are considered non-transient non- 
community water systems and are subject to the LCR. In Michigan, there are 755 such schools and child care centers 
that must monitor for lead to demonstrate compliance. 



Response to Corrosion Control Questions 


- Lime Softening can affect the pH in water 

- The pH of the water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leaching of lead from pipes into 
the water 

- As per the requirements in the Lead/Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for two 
consecutive monitoring periods and the results of the monitoring demonstrated that further action was 
necessary. 

- The DEQ promptly notified the Flint water system of the need for additional measures and the city of 
Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need.

Below is a summary of the Flint TAC meeting to obtain the committee's 
endorsement to switch back to Detroit water. 

1. The TAC endorses the switch back to the DWSD 

2. Marc Edwards of VA Tech supports the switchover to DWSD with conclusion 
that Flint River water with corrosion control will still be 4 times more corrosive 
than water from DWSD after 5 weeks of treatment. 

3. Genesee County states two weeks to prepare pipeline for re-use (flush, 
disinfect, sample, etc) 

4. Supplemental corrosion control still needed with DWSD water and ACT 399 
submittal can be made in approx one week. 

5. No pros were brought to the table for staying on the Flint River.

administrative officer of the City of Flint.” On March 28, 2013, Public Act 436 will 
become effective and provides that an emergency financial manager appointed and 
serving under state law immediately prior to the effective date shall continue to 
serve as an emergency manager under Public Act 436. As an alternative to 
continuation of an emergency manager, and if the financial emergency has been 
rectified, Public Act 436 authorizes the governor to appoint a receivership transition 
advisory board, which serves at the pleasure of the governor and monitors the

ADOPTED: 




RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY FROM 
KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

It is in the long term best interests of the City of Flint to enter into a contract with the 
KWA to purchase up to eighteen (1 8) units of capacity. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase up to eighteen ( 18 ) units of capacity. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, vvitli approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

FLINT, MI - Flint is one step closer to getting its water from Lake Huron as part of the Karegnondi Water Authority. 

The vote, approved 7-1 at tire Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25 

[http://w%vTv.mlive,com/ne\vs/flint/index,ssf/20i3/o3/flint_citj r _council_again_delay.litml] , may have set in motion the 
end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. 

Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it 
to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and wilt be treated in Flint, 

Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint’s getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint 
River. 

Tuesday’s meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. 

“We got there,” Councilman Joshua Freeman said. “That’s the important thing.” 

There were more than 50 people at Monday’s meeting. 

“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision,” said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River 
Watershed Coalition executive director. “If we start drawing water out of the Fiint River, we are at risk of having to start releasing w'ater 
from our reservoirs.” 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a count}' water and waste advisory board. The 
KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. 

Wright said construction could start in May. 

State treasuiy officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved. 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined 
the pipeline - a nearly $4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. 

Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years 

[http://www.nilive.coin/news/fllnt/index, ssf/20i3/o3/flint_city_council_delays_deci.html] by getting water from the 
KWA. 

"It’s a historic night in the City of Flint,” Walling said. “The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because 
there will be increased treatment cost for the river water.” 

He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint’s water 
plant. 

Flint’s water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times 
per year. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote.

Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still ... Page 2 of 2 


“It was a protest vote,” Nolden said. “I knew they had enough votes. I just feel like the Flint River is our best option.” 

Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. 

Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials 
said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized.

What: Jeff Wright Statement on Flint City Council Approving Resolution to Join KWA. 
When: March 26, 2013 


Additional Info: Jeff Wright, CEO of the KWA, today praised the Flint City Council for voting to approve 
a resolution to officially have the City of Flint join the KWA and its' water line, 

"I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint's City Council and Mayor," said 
Wright. "I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the 
residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials." The next step in the 
process will come with the KWA Board executing the contract for the City. 

"The most important aspect from the vote is the fact that we as an Authority can move forward 
knowing Flint's intentions," said Wright. 

Despite Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz publicly supporting the project, Wright had made a vote by 
council a condition of Flint joining the KWA so the residents would have their say. 

"There is a basic tenet that government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the council 
vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, 
should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside of their community," said Wright. 

At the next Water and Waste Advisory Board meeting a vote will be taken to award a contract for 
construction of the intake portion of the water line. All bids were submitted to the board at their last 
meeting for review.

STATE TREASURER 


Mr. Edward Kurtz April 11,2013 

Emergency Manager 
City of Flint 

1 101 South Saginaw Street 
Flint, MI 48502 

Dear Mr. Kurtz: 

Thank you for your March 29, 2013 letter, which is attached for reference. As the Emergency 
Manager for the City of Flint (“Flint” or “City”), you have asked for my concurrence, pursuant to 
Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, to authorize a contract in 
excess of $50,000.00 not subject to competitive bidding. This request was related to the City 
entering into an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) for provision of raw 
water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 1 5, 2013. As such, this approval 
will be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012, 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA.

Flint council supports buying water from Lake Huron 
through KWA

FLINT, MI — Flint residents may soon get their water from Lake Huron. 


The Flint City Council voted 7-1 to get 16 million gallons per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. 


"This is about compromise," said Councilman Sheldon Neeley. 


Neeley got support from Councilman Joshua Freeman, after the two were previously at odds about the amount the city should withdraw 
from Lake Huron. 

Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone "no" vote. 


"It was a protest vote," Nolden said. "I just feel like the Flint River is our best option." 

Genesee County Drain Commissioner said construction of the pipeline could start in May. 

The city currently pays to get its water from Detroit. 

State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over 
$50,000 must be approved.

Resolution: 


130165.2 

Presented: 3 - 11-13 

Adopted: 3 - 25-13 


AMENDED RESOLUTION TO PURCHASE CAPACITY 
FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY 


BY THE MAYOR: 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is a governmental consortium of cities and 
counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide 
water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac, Lapeer, and Genesee counties. 
The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County, Lapeer County, Genesee 
County, the City of Flint, and the City of Lapeer. 

The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the 
purchase of water. A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will cost the 
region $2.1 billion over the next 25 years. In contrast, if the region builds its own pipeline, the 
projected costs are $1.9 billion over the same period. After the initial 25 year period, the 
projected costs would be less then 25% of the projected water costs from Detroit. 

In order to build the pipeline, the KWA needs commitment from its members regarding 
the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline. The KWA is allowed to withdraw 
85 million gallons of water per day. Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million 
gallons per day known as units. For each unit of capacity that a member purchases, the buyer 
shall pay to the KWA a one time fee of $32,300.00. Additionally, the buyer shall pay to the 
KWA not less then $32,300.00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the 
buyer. After water is made available, the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not 
to exceed $355,300.00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full. If it is 
determined that the costs per unit will exceed $355,300.00 the buyer has a right to cancel the 
contract. 

The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the 
pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers. The buyer has a right to 
resell capacity and water rights. Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be 
entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party’s percentage share of the total 
capacity under contract. 

The City of Flint has decided that it is in its long term best interests to enter into a 
contract with the KWA to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from 
the Flint River. 



IT IS RESOLVED that City officials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA 
to purchase SIXTEEN (16) units of capacity, plus TWO (2) units from the Flint River. 

IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide 
KWA information needed to administer the contract and, with approval of the Chief Legal 
Officer, to make minor (non-material) modifications to the contract.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 


NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A four-month plan has been developed, listing the priorities to be accomplished for the 
remainder of EM Coulter’s term and beyond. 

The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015, shows a further decline in pension 
funding down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed a lawsuit against the 
State of Michigan, Department of Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the 
reduction of city retiree healthcare. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, Connecticut, accepted the position of City 
Manager. His contract has been finalized and he will begin work October 1, 2015.

Page 2 


Lincoln Park (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 15 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $636K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Last May voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by 
a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative plan under provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to 
manage and operate the retirement system. A request for up to six mills per year to fund 
public safety pensions will be placed on the November ballot. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabili z e pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 


FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The Detroit City Council reconsidered the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s 
proposed FY 16 water and sewer rate increase and approved it on July 21, 2015. This 
action eliminated a potential budget deficit, which was a concern raised by the State 
Treasurer in his July 2, 2015 letter to the city. 

The city issued its FY 14 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) on June 30, 
2015 (following two three-month extensions granted by the State Treasurer). The city 
continued to have a deficit for FY 14 as that year closed prior to the bankruptcy 
confirmation in December 2014. The city expects to report a surplus in its FY 15 CAFR, 
which is currently underway and expected to be completed no later than March 2016. 

At the FRC’s July 27, 2015 meeting, the city indicated it would reduce its bankruptcy 
exit financing debt by $30M (from $275M to $245M) prior to its scheduled syndication 
in mid-August. The State Treasurer and FRC Executive Director are participating in the 
city’s rating agency and investor presentations to discuss the State’s oversight role. 

On July 29 and July 30, 2015, the city received its first post-bankruptcy credit ratings 
from S&P and Moody’s. Only S&P rated the city’s exit financing, for which it received 
an investment-grade “A” rating, with a stable outlook. The exit financing is secured by a 
statutory lien on city income tax revenue. Both rating agencies provided the city with 
updated underlying General Obligation (GO) ratings. S&P assigned a “B” rating, with a 
stable outlook. Moody’s upgraded the city from “B3” to “B2,” with a positive outlook. 



Page 3 


Detroit (continued) 

Significant Action/Issues 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the FRC on May 28, 
2015. The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its 
appointment in November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in 
December 2015. 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 


RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The City Council has approved a new, four-year collective bargaining agreement with the 
police bargaining unit. Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and had a number of 
concerns with the terms including the identification of over $237 K in increased costs in 
Year 1. Despite these concerns, the RTAB voted 2 to 1 to ratify the approval of these 
collective bargaining agreements. 

The city wishes to seek bids for retiree health insurance coverage after being informed by 
Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K will become effective October 1, 2015. 
The RTAB has approved this request and Treasury is working with the city to identify 
potential legal ramifications in the lawsuit with retirees if coverage is changed to a new 
provider. 

The city was informed by Blue Cross that a billing oversight has resulted in the city 
underpaying for insurance coverage for retirees in the amount of $853K. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
The RTAB approved this item on August 5, 2015. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury is participating in the selection 
process. The City Council will be interviewing the finalists for the position in August 
2015. 

Completion of the bond tender process is projected for August 2015. The 2015 
Refunding Bonds will be rated Single A, due to the city’s pledge of distributable state 
aid. 



Page 4 


Standard & Poor’s released its rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the 
bond tender release. The city’s long-term rating for the existing bonds was downgraded 
with a negative outlook. The downgrade of these bonds is similar to the rating by 
Standard and Poor’s on the City of Detroit’s DWSD tender refinancing. 



Page 5 


Allen Park (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. A Settlement Conference was held between all parties on July 20, 2015, but no 
resolution was achieved. The court has ordered mediation proceedings. 

The city’s current budget is balanced. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city completed its move to a new temporary City Hall on June 8, 2015. 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on May 26, 2015, and the RTAB approved 
this action on June 3, 2015. 

- Inquiries are being made to add one member to the RTAB. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. 

- TAt-Large Commissioner Mary Donald passed away on June 12, 2015. On August 10, 
2015, the City Commission appointed Edward Isom to finish her unexpired term, which 
ends December 31, 2015. On August 11, 2015, the RTAB approved the appointment. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

The City Commission adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 15, 2015. The RTAB approved 
this action on June 22, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached.

Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The city has completed a balanced five-year financial plan. One challenge includes the 
outsourcing of fire services which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan 
solvent. This is the first time the city has proposed a viable path out of receivership. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have promised. 

The RTAB approved the city’s choice for city controller at the August meeting. Tim 
Sadowski will commence work later this month. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. 
Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing PA 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

At a special meeting held on August 11, 2015, the City Council approved the transfer of 
$323K from the Fire Department to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol 
officers. The RTAB approved this transfer on August 12, 2015. 

On August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court invalidated the city’s 35 percent water 
and sewer rate increases which were reverted back to 2011 rates. This decision could 
potentially could cost the City’s General Fund up to $50M. The city expects to receive a 
final order from the Circuit Court on August 17, 2015, and is prepared to file an 
emergency appeal to the Court of Appeals. The City Administrator has instituted hiring 
and spending freezes across all departments, and Treasury is working with the city to 
identify the impact from this decision. 

In addition, on August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an 
emergency injunction that prevents the city from further charging water service fees, 
instituted on all water bills to recoup funds used to settle a 2007 lawsuit. The ruling 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund. The ruling 
also prohibits the city from disconnecting water service for late payment and prevents the 
city from placing liens on property for past due water bills. The city plans to appeal this 
decision.

Flint (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

The City Council approved an amendment to the EM adopted FY 15 Budget on June 29, 
2015. The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $495K General Fund balance. The 
RTAB denied the budget amendment at their July 15, 2015 meeting because the City 
Council also approved the use of $200K of the city’s $495K General Fund balance for 
grass and weed abatement throughout the city. The City Council reconsidered and 
adopted the budget amendments, which were approved by the RTAB on August 12, 
2015. The City Administrator has also developed a plan to allocate additional resources 
toward grass and weed abatement. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB approved the issuance of an Obsolete Property 
Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) certificate for a downtown property. The City Council had

make the final determination on economic development projects. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB also approved ballot language for the renewal of the 
Regional Flint Mass Transportation Authority millage. The renewal is proposed for five 
years at the current 0.6 mills per year. This proposal will appear on the November 2015 
ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 2015, to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. Another 
lawsuit to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit was filed in Genesee 
County Circuit Court on July 16, 2015. 

The city’s Economic and Community Development Director is leaving in August 2015. 
Current staffing vacancies also include the City Treasurer and the Human Resources 
Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statute and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city is preparing to issue an RFP for a reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are 
completely installed and will be in use by August 17, 2015. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project commenced on August 10, 2015. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are

assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments

benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM two-year budget.

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the Gray & Company Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary 
private equity fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC 
proceedings, its effects on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with 
Gray’s firm. The Pension Board has withdrawn its pension assets from Gray & Company 
controlled funds. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A collective bargaining agreement with the Technical and Professional Office Workers 
Association of Michigan was approved by the Treasurer and will be effective on 
November 1, 2015. The city eliminated retiree healthcare and reduced employee paid 
time off. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed suit against the State, 
Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the reduction of city retiree healthcare. 
The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary for the full amount 
of the unfunded pension liability. The city believes that the actuary did not properly 
advise the city regarding long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The 
city paid the required ARC each year yet the funding levels were reduced to critical 
levels. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters.

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, CT, accepted the position of City Manager, 
and began on September 29, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 11, 2015, EM Coulter submitted his four-month plan listing the priorities to 
be accomplished for the remainder of his term and beyond. 

EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

The May 2015 actuarial analysis showed pension funding at 23%. 

FY 14 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from FY 13 ($89K). Increases were in Public Safety- 
Si. 1M, Public Works- $700K, and Culture and Recreation- S600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by a 53% to 
47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have helped fund 
fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM is pursuing an alternative plan under 
provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to manage and operate the 
retirement system. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabilize pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The city held its September consensus revenue estimating conference on September 17, 
2015 and presented its report to the FRC. The estimates of major revenues are up slightly 
based on improvement in the FY 15 unaudited actuals. However, growth estimates 
remain conservative as the city wants to minimize risk in its budget. The city will 
formally update revenues again in February 2016 for use in its FY 17 - FY 20 four-year 
financial plan. 

As the city enters the testing phase for the Enterprise Resource Planning system in 
October 2015, the city is evaluating revisions to its project schedule and contract change 
orders. The city may present those changes to the FRC in October or November. 

The city is in negotiations with its bus drivers’ union on a new labor contract, which will 
require FRC approval. When it is finalized, this will be the first collective bargaining 
agreement submitted to the FRC for review. The Mayor briefed the FRC in closed 
session at the September 28, 2015 meeting on his strategy and the details of this pending 
contract. 



3 


Significant Action/Issues 

The FRC filed its first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit on May 28, 2015. 
The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its appointment in 
November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in December. 

The city’s four-year financial plan, approved by the FRC in April, encompassed the 
second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget and used that as its 
base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17 - FY 19). The City will begin its FY 
17 - FY 20 budget development process in October and November 2015. This will be the 
first budget since the EM’s departure that the Mayor and City Council will develop and 
will be subject to FRC review and approval. 

At its September 28, 2015, the FRC approved its first statutorily required annual 
certification of the city’s substantial compliance with its requirements under the 
Michigan Financial Review Commission Act. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

Beginning in January 2016, individual city income tax filers will file their Detroit city 
income taxes with Treasury instead of the city. Treasury plans to collect Detroit’s 
corporate city income tax and universal withholding (pending approval of legislation) in 
2017. 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Judge Mark Boonstra of the Michigan Court of Claims, granted 
the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by retirees of the City of Allen Park who 
challenged changes made to their healthcare by former Emergency Manager, Joyce 
Parker. The retirees contested the ability of the EM to modify retiree healthcare under 
PA 72 of 1980. The judge ruled that by the time the change actually took place the EM 
was operating under PA 436 of 2012. The plaintiffs also attacked PA 436 of 2012 
claiming it was unconstitutional. Judge Boonstra stated that the claim met none of the 
tests necessary to support a charge of unconstitutional vagueness. 

The City Council offered Acting Assistant City Administrator Mark Kibby the position 
of City Administrator at its September 22, 2015 meeting. The RTAB will consider this 
appointment at its October 7, 2015 meeting. 

The bond tender extension expired on October 1, 2015. $1 1.21M or 42.56% of the bonds 
were tendered. The city has accepted all tendered bonds subject to the conditions of the 
invitation. 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The city will be going to arbitration with the fire union over resolution of terms that were 
inadvertently inserted into the signed contract from an earlier draft. These terms were not 



4 


in the Tentative Agreement signed between the city and the union but included in the 
final copy signed by Emergency Manager Parker, prior to her departure. The city has 
been trying to resolve this issue for months. Treasury continues to monitor these 
developments. 

The city switched to a new provider for retiree health insurance coverage on October 1, 
2015, after being informed by Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K was being 
levied. The RTAB approved this request and the city attorneys believes that there are no 
legal ramifications with retirees if coverage is changed to a new provider. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

At its September meeting, the RTAB affirmed the city’s approval of a new four-year 
collective bargaining agreement with the clerical and public works bargaining units. 
Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and identified over $40K in increased costs 
in Year 1. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. The City Council approved an agreement that was achieved during court- 
ordered mediation. The agreement will require the city to pay $600K (from the budgeted 
Contingency Fund). The RTAB approved this agreement at its September 2, 2015 
meeting. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

Fitigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. No 
date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Farry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

The Assistant City Manager/Community and Economic Development Director, Marja 
Winters, will be stepping down in November due to family reasons. She is currently 
assisting the city in finding a replacement. 

Benton Harbor is hiring the MMF to do an executive search for a new finance director. 
Treasury is assisting Benton Harbor with cost of the search. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. Treasury 
will be inviting the Mayor and City Manager to meet in Fansing to discuss issues facing 
the city. 

The city received notification from the Department of Fabor in 2014 of a wage claim 
filed with their department, in relation to a contract addendum to the Public Safety 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. City staff and legal counsel have worked with the U.S. 
Department of Fabor to facilitate a settlement to this claim. There are two parts to the 
settlement: 1) correction of wages going forward; and 2) correction of back wages from 
the inception of the addendum. The two parts total $19K. The City Commission 



5 


approved the settlement at its August 3, 2015 meeting. The RTAB approved the 
settlement on August 11, 2015. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 


Eeorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

Treasury has been informed that Joyce Parker announced her resignation from the 
RTAB, effective October 31, 2015. Potential replacements are being considered. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have proposed. 

The City’s new full-time controller, Tim Sadowski has replaced the previous part-time 
contracted controller. 

On September 22, 2015, the City Manager reported that the new controller is revising the 
current budget and 5-year financial plan. It was discovered that the baseline was 
inaccurate, according to the City Manager. Treasury will be analyzing the budget and 
financial plan and discussing issues with the city. One challenge includes reducing fire 
service costs, which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan solvent. _ 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing P.A. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Larkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker-Griffea, 

Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

On August 7, 2015, a Genesee Circuit Court lawsuit, Shears v. Flint, invalidated a 
previous 35% increase in water and sewer rates, reverting back to 2011 rates. This 
injunction also requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water 
Fund, prevents the city from collecting certain past due water bills, and from 
disconnecting water service for nonpayment. The City has estimated that this injunction 
could potentially cost the General Fund $50M. Thus far, the city’s appellate efforts have 
not been successful. Most recently, Judge Archie Hayman certified Shears v. Flint as a 
class action. 



6 


As a result of Shears v. Flint decision which required the city to roll back water rates by 
35%, the Finance Director on October 1, 2015 estimated that revenue has decreased by 
$666K per month and projects a loss of $6.6M for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
addition for the period of August 10, 2015 thru September 2, 2015, the city has realized 
S1.75M less in cash receipts as the same period last year due to a decrease in payment 
activity. 

Separate litigation was held that Emergency Manager Mike Brown had no statutory 
authority to later ratify water and sewer rate increases from May of 2012. The city filed 
an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, but the court did not address the appeal 
because the city missed the filing deadline by one day. The case has been remanded back 
to Genesee County Circuit Court to resolve some outstanding matters. Treasury is 
discussing the need for additional legal representation with the city. 

Concerns have been raised about the amount of lead in the city’s water system after a 
study by Virginia Tech University suggests that the amount is much higher than standard 
testing shows. The city is in compliance with state and federal lead standards but will be 
adding a corrosion inhibitor into the treatment process to reduce the amount of lead 
leaching into the system. The city is also providing free and independent water quality 
testing to residents. Treasury is monitoring this issue closely. 

Mayor Walling has issued a letter to the State requesting $20M in funds to assist the city 
in making needed capital improvements to its water system plus another $10M to address 
the issue of lead leaching into the system. 

On September 11, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court dismissed a case (Coalition for 
Clean Water v City of Flint) to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 
The RTAB approved ballot language for the renewal of the Regional Flint Mass 
Transportation Authority millage. The proposed renewal is for five years at the current 
0.6 mills per year and will appear on the November 2015 ballot. 

The Economic and Community Development Director resigned in August 2015. Current 
staffing vacancies also include the Treasurer and the Human Resources Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statutes and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city has issued an RFP and is reviewing the proposals. 

The city has been informed they no longer need to inform residents that it is in violation 
of the Clean Water Standards Act. Results from the first monthly test, since the 
installation of the granulated active-charcoal filter, showed that the city is in compliance 
with the federal Drinking Water Act. The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to 
perform a leak detection study. This project commenced in August 2015 and is 
approximately 1/3 complete. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Genesee County 911 assumed dispatch responsibilities for city police and fire on August 
17, 2015. This merger was approved in 2014 and is expected to save the city $1M per 
year. 

On August 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a transfer of $323K from the Fire Department 
to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol officers. The city has initiated a 
hiring process. 



7 


The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
approximately 75% complete and the intake is completed. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are installed 
and are in use. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city is undertaking a $6M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into 
sanitary sewers. Certain rehabilitation elements of the project will commence on October 
15, 2015 and conclude in spring 2016. The sewer relief portion will begin in December 
2015 and will be completed next summer. 

The city is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators review 
options for reducing costs and providing more efficient service. 

The contractor Tyler Technologies is reassessing all residential and commercial 
properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvements 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM’s two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments

Deputy Mayor. The RTAB approved this appointment on September 16, 2015. 

On July 6, 2016, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the 
lawsuit filed by the city against Ottawa Towers LLC / Phoenix Center. Treasury is 
working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator which could 
free up $2M in demolition funds. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



On August 19, 2015, the RTAB approved filling the positions of Customer Service 
Representative and Community Relations Specialist. These positions will assist the 
Mayor with community and economic development activities. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the General Fund accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied. In May, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the MI Supreme 
Court. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker.

postpone the levy until July 2016. 

On August 18, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled (Trahey v City of Inkster) that

Elimination Plan for 2014, select a firm to advise the township on financial matters, and 
perform an inventory of assets. 



10 


Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 Budget and the Consent

retirees. This will result in a savings of $20M annually. 

The county’s annual structural General Fund deficit is approximately $52M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $53M in General Fund savings, 
$25M of which comes from changes to pension and healthcare benefits for active 
employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. 

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

We're setting up a meeting with you, Harvey Hollins, Nick Lyon and Dan Wyant as soon as possible to make sure you are 
in the same loop on this as we are. The issues you raise in your Setter are similar to the same ones we are raising 
internally ourselves. Lead is not an acceptable risk in any event, however lead content pipes are prevalent in older cities 
throughout Michigan and well all have to pool our efforts to work with these pipes now and in the future. Although 
there are some legitimate questions relating to the conclusions reached by the Hurley folks, they are a city institution 
and we would have expected them to report and discuss those concerns with city leadership so that the city could act, 
but that is a different subject. 

Whenever you are available we'll do our best to schedule and come over and meet with you.

STATE TREASURER 


Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A four-month plan has been developed, listing the priorities to be accomplished for the 
remainder of EM Coulter’s term and beyond. 

The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015, shows a further decline in pension 
funding down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed a lawsuit against the 
State of Michigan, Department of Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the 
reduction of city retiree healthcare. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, Connecticut, accepted the position of City 
Manager. His contract has been finalized and he will begin work October 1, 2015.

Lincoln Park (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 15 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $636K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Last May voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by 
a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative plan under provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to 
manage and operate the retirement system. A request for up to six mills per year to fund 
public safety pensions will be placed on the November ballot.

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The Detroit City Council reconsidered the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s 
proposed FY 16 water and sewer rate increase and approved it on July 21, 2015. This 
action eliminated a potential budget deficit, which was a concern raised by the State 
Treasurer in his July 2, 2015 letter to the city. 

The city issued its FY 14 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) on June 30, 
2015 (following two three-month extensions granted by the State Treasurer). The city 
continued to have a deficit for FY 14 as that year closed prior to the bankruptcy 
confirmation in December 2014. The city expects to report a surplus in its FY 15 CAFR, 
which is currently underway and expected to be completed no later than March 2016. 

At the FRC’s July 27, 2015 meeting, the city indicated it would reduce its bankruptcy 
exit financing debt by $30M (from $275M to $245M) prior to its scheduled syndication 
in mid-August. The State Treasurer and FRC Executive Director are participating in the 
city’s rating agency and investor presentations to discuss the State’s oversight role. 

On July 29 and July 30, 2015, the city received its first post-bankruptcy credit ratings 
from S&P and Moody’s. Only S&P rated the city’s exit financing, for which it received 
an investment-grade “A” rating, with a stable outlook. The exit financing is secured by a 
statutory lien on city income tax revenue. Both rating agencies provided the city with 
updated underlying General Obligation (GO) ratings. S&P assigned a “B” rating, with a 
stable outlook. Moody’s upgraded the city from “B3” to “B2,” with a positive outlook.

Detroit (continued) 

Significant Action/Issues 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the FRC on May 28, 
2015. The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its 
appointment in November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in 
December 2015. 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 


RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The City Council has approved a new, four-year collective bargaining agreement with the 
police bargaining unit. Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and had a number of 
concerns with the terms including the identification of over $237 K in increased costs in 
Year 1. Despite these concerns, the RTAB voted 2 to 1 to ratify the approval of these 
collective bargaining agreements. 

The city wishes to seek bids for retiree health insurance coverage after being informed by 
Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K will become effective October 1, 2015. 
The RTAB has approved this request and Treasury is working with the city to identify 
potential legal ramifications in the lawsuit with retirees if coverage is changed to a new 
provider. 

The city was informed by Blue Cross that a billing oversight has resulted in the city 
underpaying for insurance coverage for retirees in the amount of $853K. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
The RTAB approved this item on August 5, 2015. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury is participating in the selection 
process. The City Council will be interviewing the finalists for the position in August 
2015. 

Completion of the bond tender process is projected for August 2015. The 2015 
Refunding Bonds will be rated Single A, due to the city’s pledge of distributable state 
aid. 



Page 4 


Standard & Poor’s released its rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the 
bond tender release. The city’s long-term rating for the existing bonds was downgraded 
with a negative outlook. The downgrade of these bonds is similar to the rating by 
Standard and Poor’s on the City of Detroit’s DWSD tender refinancing.

Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The city has completed a balanced five-year financial plan. One challenge includes the 
outsourcing of fire services which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan 
solvent. This is the first time the city has proposed a viable path out of receivership. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have promised. 

The RTAB approved the city’s choice for city controller at the August meeting. Tim 
Sadowski will commence work later this month. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. 
Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing PA 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

At a special meeting held on August 11, 2015, the City Council approved the transfer of 
$323K from the Fire Department to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol 
officers. The RTAB approved this transfer on August 12, 2015. 

On August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court invalidated the city’s 35 percent water 
and sewer rate increases which were reverted back to 2011 rates. This decision could 
potentially could cost the City’s General Fund up to $50M. The city expects to receive a 
final order from the Circuit Court on August 17, 2015, and is prepared to file an 
emergency appeal to the Court of Appeals. The City Administrator has instituted hiring 
and spending freezes across all departments, and Treasury is working with the city to 
identify the impact from this decision. 

In addition, on August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an 
emergency injunction that prevents the city from further charging water service fees, 
instituted on all water bills to recoup funds used to settle a 2007 lawsuit. The ruling 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund. The ruling 
also prohibits the city from disconnecting water service for late payment and prevents the 
city from placing liens on property for past due water bills. The city plans to appeal this 
decision.

Flint (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

The City Council approved an amendment to the EM adopted FY 15 Budget on June 29, 
2015. The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $495K General Fund balance. The 
RTAB denied the budget amendment at their July 15, 2015 meeting because the City 
Council also approved the use of $200K of the city’s $495K General Fund balance for 
grass and weed abatement throughout the city. The City Council reconsidered and 
adopted the budget amendments, which were approved by the RTAB on August 12, 
2015. The City Administrator has also developed a plan to allocate additional resources 
toward grass and weed abatement. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB approved the issuance of an Obsolete Property 
Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) certificate for a downtown property. The City Council had 
initially rejected issuance of the OPRA certificate but an EM Order permits the RTAB to 
make the final determination on economic development projects. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB also approved ballot language for the renewal of the 
Regional Flint Mass Transportation Authority millage. The renewal is proposed for five 
years at the current 0.6 mills per year. This proposal will appear on the November 2015 
ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 2015, to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. Another 
lawsuit to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit was filed in Genesee 
County Circuit Court on July 16, 2015. 

The city’s Economic and Community Development Director is leaving in August 2015. 
Current staffing vacancies also include the City Treasurer and the Human Resources 
Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statute and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city is preparing to issue an RFP for a reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are 
completely installed and will be in use by August 17, 2015. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project commenced on August 10, 2015. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
75% complete and the intake should be completed in August 2015.

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Administrator has issued a Corrective Action Plan to the City Clerk to correct a 
number of operational deficiencies that resulted in the wrong election submission dates 
being provided to local candidates. 

On June 12, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a decision by Genesee 
County Circuit Judge Richard Yuille, who dismissed a claim that the city violated its own 
ordinances when the EM raised water and sewer rates in 201 1. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments

benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013

Gray’s firm. The Pension Board has withdrawn its pension assets from Gray & Company 
controlled funds. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension

As you know, the Flint people have requested Dillon's ok to break away from the DWSD. Andy has reviewed the 
proposed action, had it analyzed by Treasury and Dan Wyant and DEQ, and they all agree that Flint is correct. I have no 
way of determining whether this is the right action except to depend on the two departments charged with this 
responsibility, so I recommend that we support their determination and let the chips fall where they may. This will 
happen early next week, so we need to have you made aware and develop a message of support if that is what you want 
to do. 

We'll need to make sure that Orr knows about this as soon as possible so he can take it into his calculations. It would 
certainly diminish the DWSD base, and probably spin off a series of political questions for others still involved in the 
Detroit system. But, I don't see how you can support Detroit to the detriment of the rest of the state. You've done a lot 
for the city, but you also need to have a strong support for outstate for 2014. 

Sorry to bug you on your vacation, but the two emails today couldn't be avoided. I was trying to think of a way to make 
it up to you, so here goes: GO BLUE! (That was really tough to say...).

They have been notified per the plan and have until Andy returns next week to present their counter proposal. The 
concept is executed. Sorry for the confusion but they haven't followed up with Flint and I thought you should know we 
were moving to the next step at the end of the ten days. I was indicating that we were expecting to move forward in 
case you had further reservations and wanted us to delay further.

For what it is worth, I would look at having flint spilt off the water system into some kind of 
regional authority and separate the finances from the general city if you are going to move 
forward with kiragani. The city has a propensity to use the water system as a cash cow and it will 
help them avoid that problem in the future.

Flint 


If Flint is going to go into some kind of regional authority, then we need to firewall the finances of water from the 
general city budget. How do we keep the city from using the water system as a cash flow tool? We need to help them 
avoid the problem that they have been guilty of in the past of capturing water monies from customers before 
remittance to the Authority and using it elsewhere. 

I suspect that is the motivation behind their desire to split off from DWSD. If the monies go to legacy debt it will help 
Flint immeasurably, if general fund then they'll never get on top of the situation. Right now their legacy debt is higher 
than their wages for current employees and that is obviously unsustainable. I realize I'm not telling you anything you 
don't already know, just re-emphasizing.

That is the $64,000 question. DEQ is firm that KWA is better. Are they an honest broker? I have to admit 
the engineering firm Treasury hired (Tucker Young) didn't make their case. No one on our side (DEQ or 
Treasury) sided with DWSD. I was the lone hold out but I couldn't argue against the defense Flint put forward 
against the TY report.

Interesting threat here. They will seek to recover sunk costs through rates in last two years. My

Folks - I am disappointed to report that Flint/Genesee rejected the offer last night by 
press release to the Flint Journal. 

The next step will be to send Flint a termination letter. Flint plans on buying water from 
DWSD for the next 3 years. Under the old contract, a termination letter is sent and then 
12 months later DWSD can set new rates for the water delivered in year 2 and 3. The 
new rates will recover all sunk costs. 

I am convinced the DWSD team acted in good faith and put forth an attractive 
offer. The local politics trumped reason, economics and engineering. I wish the people 
of Genesee County good luck and that the project saves them all the money promised by 
the politicians.

Gentlemen, 


The cliffnotes version: 

Proposal offers a today rate of water for Flint/Genesee of $10.46 as compared to 
$20.00 paid currently per Mcf - 48% less that could be realized nearly imediately 
and even more when compared to the increases coming with KWA. 

When compared over the 30 year horizon the DWSD proposal saves $800 million 
dollars or said differently - saves 20% over the KWA proposal.

RE: A Lil Good News 


In the Flint meeting, you and Capt Sands talked about how we need the local emergency coordinator to ask the MSP for 
help? We're ready to do that How do you want that done? A letter from Flint, a call to Kalenske, etc.?

Thanks! 

I can tell you that these events have been one of the most positive tasks I’ve done. Truly transformational for my

A little good news given all the stuff in Flint. 

The Benton Harbor Public Safety forum had slightly under 100 participants; another successful

Dennis: 

Capt. Kelenske has been in contact with the local EM. 
He is watching closely everything they are doing.

April 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
1 1 1 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, MI 48909 


Dear Governor Snyder: 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 


As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General 
Fund deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan 
Board. City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 


1 


The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
lias been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over 
daily activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%. and City 
operations have been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no 
longer being done internally, 911 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 
2015. and the City-funded 68 lk District Court is expected to become pail of the County- funded 
67 th District Court in January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the 
Karegondi Water Authority instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective 
bargaining contracts have also been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the 
stage for permanent reductions in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the 
level of parks maintenance. Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, 
with reduced assistance from the City : and the City golf courses have been leased to private 
operators. 


I have greatly appreciated the opportunity' to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 


Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


® A meeting has been confirmed for October 27 with DHHS to discuss all lead 
education material for schools. 

• DEQ staff discussed with the city of Flint’s consultant, Lockwood, Andrews & 
Newnam, Inc., the remaining items that are needed for issuance of Michigan’s 
Safe Drinking Water Act (Act 399) construction permit. Staff anticipates receiving 
these items on October 27. 

® DEQ staff obtained approximately 10,895 records from the city of Flint’s GIS 

system regarding service line index cards and extracted them into a table format 
for additional data review. Data review has been initiated by DEQ’s Lansing 
District Office staff. 

• DLARA and DEQ staff tentatively plans to conduct plumbing assessments at 
Brownell K-2 STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on 
October 30. DLARA staff will contact the Flint Community Schools’ facility 
administrator to confirm the date and approximate times. 

Additional Actions: 

® All of the 124 samples that were taken at Freeman Elementary School on 
Saturday, October 24, were analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory on Monday, 
October 26. The data is being compiled into a spreadsheet to allow an 
evaluation of the various sampling points. Initial indications are that there will 
need to be some replacement of plumbing fixtures, but issues do not seem to 
exist deeper into the plumbing infrastructure. Further sequential testing will be 
conducted at select points to verify that water is being drawn from the main. 

® DEQ staff met to discuss lessons learned from the sampling event at Freeman 
Elementary School. A number of observations were made with respect to how to 
streamline the process. The group agreed to incorporate several of the 
observations into the sampling protocol. The protocol is being updated to reflect 
these changes.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The sampling protocol was revised to address comments received on October 22 
from EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force. 

® Staff assisted DLARA in conducting a plumbing assessment at Freeman 

Elementary School. Actions were taken to prepare for sampling to be conducted 
on Saturday, October 24. 

• The information requested by the DEQ was not received on October 23 from 
Flint’s consultant, Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN); thus, the 
construction permit for phosphate equipment was not issued. DEQ staff 
discussed with Flint Water Treatment Plant operator Brent Wright and Utilities 
Superintendent Michael Glascow. Brent confirmed that he needs to provide 
some of the information regarding the phosphate product to LAN. 

• DEQ staff discussed with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright the need for 
quarterly test runs and monthly operation reporting details while the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant is in standby mode. Also included the need to report phosphate 
dosages and phosphate residuals (plant tap and distribution) in the monthly 
operation report. 

• John O’Brien (Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office) contacted DEQ 
staff in response to our October 22 e-mail. The Lapeer County Road 
Commission (LCRC) has placed a stop work order on Contract S-4005; however, 
the Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office contends that the LCRC has 
no authority to issue a stop work order; thus, work is continuing. DEQ stressed 
the importance to John of the need to keep the project moving forward and to 
confirm that the contractor is following proper soil erosion measures and other 
local guidelines that may apply. 

® Based on a discussion with Michael Glascow and Brent Wright, there have not 
been major distribution system issues or upsets since the switch back to Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department. Utility operators were flushing and winterizing 
hydrants this week and flushing from the Flint Water Treatment Plant to the 
outside reaches of the distribution system. Phosphate residuals are also being 
measured twice per week at Flint’s bacteria monitoring sites. 

Additional Actions: 

• Representatives from DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS met on October 23 with Mayor 
Dayne Walling and Howard Croft from the city of Flint for the weekly update. 

Each group gave an overview of actions that were taken over the course of the 
week. The DEQ discussed sample results from homeowners since the offer to 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


provide free lead and copper testing was made. The DEQ also discussed the 
school sampling protocol that was developed and would be used on Saturday, 
October 24, at Freeman Elementary School. DLARA discussed the plumbing 
assessment of Freeman Elementary School that was being conducted on Friday, 
October 23. DHHS gave an update on the prioritization schema for blood lead 
screening that was being conducted for Flint residents, with the highest priority 
going to individuals with the highest risk, including young children and infants. 

® After the weekly coordination meeting, the city of Flint gave a tour of the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant to coordination committee members from the DEQ, 
DLARA, and DHHS. The tour provided a complete picture of the treatment 
process for both sources of water that could potentially be used, including water 
from the Flint River and treated water coming from Detroit. There was also 
discussion on how water from the Karegnondi Water Authority would be 
distributed, along with discussion of the supplemental addition of corrosion 
control agents. 

• On Saturday, October 24, representatives of DEQ and DLARA conducted the 

first sampling event of Flint schools at Freeman Elementary School. Media from 
several news agencies were present to cover the initial sampling event and 
conducted interviews with Karen Tommasulo and footage was taken of the 
sampling process. The sampling team consisted of seven members, and it took 
a little over three hours to conduct the entire sampling event. There was a small 
group of protesters outside of the school who stayed there for approximately an 
hour and a half, after which they peacefully disbursed. 

After the sampling event, the samples were driven to the DEQ Laboratory and 
logged into the computer system. The Laboratory’s Inorganics Unit Supervisor 
was contacted and made aware of the status of the samples. The samples were 
then prepped on Sunday, October 25, and are scheduled for analysis on 
Monday, October 26.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• DEQ staff met with DHHS staff on October 27 to discuss all lead education 
material for schools, and action items were created. 

• On October 27 DEQ’s Lansing District Office received updated dosage, pump 
specifications, and cut-sheets for phosphate product. A quick glance at the 
submittal shows most of the requested information has been provided, except for 
the NSF Standard 60 certification and the maximum dose. Staff will cross- 
reference the NSF Web site to verify proper certification and maximum dose. If 
acceptable, DEQ staff will proceed with issuance of the Act 399 permit. 

Otherwise, the city of Flint’s consultant will need to provide the DEQ with the 
NSF Standard 60 certification and maximum dose information. 

• DEQ staff has cross-referenced 46 of the 326 historical lead and copper 
monitoring sampling sites with the 10,895 service line index card information 
records available to date. 

• DEQ staff met with DHFIS staff to review and further develop childcare facility 
guidance and incorporate drinking water exposure information. Guidance is 
being provided by DHHS specific to the Genesee County emergency order, and 
separate guidance for statewide use will also be developed. 

Additional Actions: 

• Preliminary follow-up review of sampling event at Freeman Elementary School: 
DEQ and DLARA staff met and reviewed outlet/tap materials to correlate with 
sample results. DEQ staff contacted Jim Henry, Genesee County Health 
Department, to confirm the location of screening samples. The draft write-up is 
to be completed by DEQ staff on October 28. 

® The weekly meeting between DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS was held. Discussion 
topics included a review of the results for Freeman Elementary School, along 
with a discussion of what the results meant and how the data would be presented 
to the Flint Community Schools Superintendent so that the information could be 
used to create an action plan for the school. Discussion also included working 
out the logistics for conducting the plumbing evaluation and subsequent sampling 
for the other two elementary schools that had results above the action level 
during the initial screen of 13 schools. Plans are in process to conduct these two 
plumbing evaluations on Friday, October 30, with the sampling to take place on 
Saturday, October 31 .

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Discussion held on October 28 with EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force 
(Task Force) concerning monitoring results at Freeman Elementary School. A 
report that summarizes the results of the samples collected from the school for 
the lead analysis has been drafted. 

• DEQ staff discussed the items needed for the corrosion control treatment plan. 
An outline of a Corrosion Treatment Operation letter has been prepared. The 
letter will be finalized and sent to the city of Flint. Water quality parameter 
monitoring and laboratory certification was also discussed with the EPA’s Task 
Force. 

• DEQ staff completed the review and verified NSF Standard 60 conformance, 
proper dosage, and feed pump sizing. The Act 399 permit for the installation of 
the phosphate feed equipment was issued on October 28. 

• Coordinated with the DEQ Laboratory to create and produce the “Request for 
Water Analysis Forms” and the bottle order needed for sampling at Brownell K-2 
STEM Academy and Eisenhower Elementary School on Saturday, October 31 . 

Additional Action: 

DEQ Director Dan Wyant and DEQ staff met with DHHS Director Nick Lyon and DHHS 
staff to discuss coordination of the messaging of data related to Flint water and blood 
samples. It was agreed that it was important to ensure that the water and blood data 
are put into context with respect to each other. Discussion also involved creating a 
message that discusses what lead concentrations in water mean from a regulatory and 
from a health-based perspective. Current regulations are not in step with current 
health-based exposure models, so additional work needs to be done to ensure a 
comprehensive message that is clear.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


® Weekly internal After Action Plan meetings are being held. The topics of 

discussion for the meeting held on October 29 included a status update of the 
time line of events. It was agreed that a long-term comprehensive time line 
needed to be created, but an outline written at a higher level was needed within 
the next week to present to the Governor’s After Action Review Panel. Additional 
discussion topics included an internal evaluation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 
1976 PA 399, as amended, as well as the federal lead and copper rule to 
determine what, if any, actions were implemented incorrectly. 

® Negotiations between the Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) and the 
DEQ have begun to set up a contract to utilize GCHD resources to conduct 
sampling of schools within the Flint Community Schools as well as parochial 
schools, charter schools, and childcare facilities. 

• The final draft of the school sampling protocol has been written and is awaiting 
final review. This version of the protocol incorporates comments by the EPA and 
will be used to sample at Eisenhower Elementary School and Brownell K-2 
STEM Academy on Saturday October 31 . Experiences from the sampling of 
Freeman Elementary School on Saturday October 24, were used to create the 
final draft, and experiences from Eisenhower and Brownell will be used to 
determine if any further changes are required.

Dear Dr. Hedman: 


This letter is in follow up to a conference call on October 20, 2015 between the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Region 5, and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The purpose of that call was to discuss 
Region 5’s Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force (Task Force) that was established to 
provide the USEPA’s technical expertise to the MDEQ and the city of Flint, Michigan. 

During that call, it was requested that the State of Michigan provide the USEPA 
with an MDEQ point of contact for the Task Force. This letter is to inform you of the 
designation of Mr. Jim Sygo, Chief Deputy Director, MDEQ, as that point of contact. 

Mr. Sygo’s contact information is below:

Flint Facts 


1. How many people have been tested since Oct. 1 Flint Water Action Plan was implemented? 

® Total of 1,836 tested, 39 elevated results 
o Children 0-5: 806 tested 
o Children 6 - 17: 525 tested 
o Adults: 505 tested 

2. What are the most recent recommendations to protect your family from lead exposure? 

• Protecting your family from lead in the water: 

o Get your water tested for lead. It's free. Call (810) 787-6537 to learn more. 

o Use a water filter in your home. MDHHS continues to provide free water filters 
and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at four locations, including the 
MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action Resource 
Department. 

o Run only cold water through the filter. 

o If you do not have a water filter, use bottled water for drinking and mixing 
formula. 

o Use filtered or bottled water for drinking (including making coffee, drink mixes, 
juice, baby formula), and cooking (even if you boil the water, the lead will stay in 
the water and food). 

o If you have to use unfiltered water for drinking or cooking, run the tap for five 
minutes before using the water 

® Testing children: 

o Children who live in the city of Flint should be tested for lead exposure. This 
should be done as soon as possible. 

o The best place to get your child's blood lead test is your doctor's office. Contact 
your primary care provider. 

o Children can also get a free lead test at the Genesee County Health Department. 
For help with transportation, call 2-1-1. 

• Safe cleaning: 

o Safe cleaning is important. Keeping your home clean and safe from lead hazards 
will help to protect your family. 

o Buildings buiit before 1978 could have lead paint in them. Use wet paper towels 
to clean up paint chips and dust in these older buildings. Be sure to clean 
around windows, play areas, and floors. 

o Wash hands and toys often with soap and water. 

o You can use unfiltered tap water to wipe down countertops, mop floors, and 
wash clothes 


The DEQ continues implementing the Governor's 10-point action plan to protect kids and families in 
Flint: 


1. SCHOOLS TESTING 




® The Governor's plan commits that DEQ will test water in every Flint school. To date, 8 
schools in Flint have undergone a thorough inspection of their plumbing. Crews from the 
state are completing one to two schools each weekend. 

® The story has been the same in each school inspected: lead exposure has been limited to old 
drinking fountains and faucets that should have been changed out years ago. When these 
fixtures are run for a couple minutes, lead presence drops to safe levels. If / when these 
fixtures are removed, it will address the lead exposure in schools. 

® DEQ has not identified lead in the deeper plumbing of the schools. That's great news. It 
means fixing the issue will be comparatively inexpensive and quick. 

2. COMMUNITY WATER TESTING 

® Since September, more than 500 residents have taken advantage of free home water 
sampling through the DEQ lab. Results are updated regularly on the DEQ web site, 
www.michigan.gov/FLINTWATER . 

• Residents are encouraged to continue taking advantage of this free service, but also are 
encouraged to get kids tested for blood lead levels. 

3. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT 

® The only way to remove the threat of lead exposure in drinking water is to remove sources like 
old faucets and lead service lines. The DEQ is working with the city to develop a long-term plan 
for removing the service lines. This is complicated because the service line is the portion that 
runs from the city system to the residence. It's the part that is mostly on private property and is 
generally considered the customer's responsibility. 

® DEQ worked with Congressman Kildee to get EPA approval to use Revolving Loan Fund dollars to 
accomplish lead service line replacement. 


OTHER VARIOUS ISSUES: 

• Cong. Kildee has renewed calls for loan forgiveness in Flint. The city owes the state 

approximately $20.8 million for past loans, and they're scheduled to be paid off in 2024. DEQ 
cannot forgive old loans; we can, however, build loan forgiveness into new loans. Forgiveness is 
presently capped at 30 percent on new loans. 

® City has called on DEQ to pay for fixes to the broader water distribution system on the idea that 
running river water through the system for 14 months ruined it. That's an unproven statement. 
The system has been in a serious state of disrepair for many years. We have not addressed this 
issue in the media. We are focused on the Governor's plan. 

® Lawmakers have called for the state to create a fund to provide wraparound services for the 
(Kildee says 7,000) kids exposed to Flint water situation. Don't know where the 7,000 number 
came from. DHHS has numbers of kids who actually have elevated blood lead levels. Again, not 
an issue we've addressed or plan to.

is no funding source identified that could cover this expense. The city expressed 
concerns that it was being asked to cover expenses for measures that other supplies 
would not be expected to implement. LAN will meet with the EPA to discuss other 
options. 

Significant Event : 

On December 8, 2015, the Department of Technology, Management and Budget 
(DTMB) confirmed that the e-mail sent from Liane Shekter Smith on August 25, 2015, to 
Lee-Anne Walters was successfully delivered to the gmail.com system at the e-mail 
address provided by Ms. Walters. The DTMB was asked to confirm delivery of that 
e-mail based on an accusation that the DEQ never responded to an inquiry, and then 
when a copy of the original e-mail was provided, an accusation was made with respect 
to the authenticity of the e-mail. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

• DHHS incorporated comments from the DEQ regarding a phosphate fact sheet 
being designed for public education purposes. DHHS then finalized the fact 
sheet utilizing the suggestions provided by the DEQ. 

• Instructions for lead and copper sampling were finalized, based on comments 
received from the EPA. The final draft was shared with city of Flint personnel on 
December 11, 2015, for use in their next round of lead and copper compliance 
monitoring. Microsoft Word and pdf versions were posted on the DEQ Web site 
on December 14, 2015, to replace the previous version of the instructions. 

• The city of Flint has hired an outside consultant to identify 150 Tier 1 sites for a 
sampling pool for use in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule. This effort 
is being taken to ensure that future sampling events include verified and 
documented Tier 1 sampling sites to ensure compliance with the Lead and 
Copper Rule. 

® DEQ staff visited Control Station #2 to observe the operation of the phosphate 
feed system. The inspection of the phosphate feed system confirmed that the 
system is in operation and the system is dosing at 2.5 mg/I as phosphate. A 
couple of minor provisions had not been completed at the time of the inspection 
but do not currently affect the operation of the supplemental addition of 
phosphate to the water. 

• DEQ staff modified the Act 399 construction permit for the Flint raw water 
transmission line. The modification was needed to allow for rerouting of the 
transmission main due to poor soil conditions that were encountered along the 
original route.

DRINKING WATER LEAD AND COPPER SAMPLING INSTRUCTIONS 


Dear Resident: 

Thank you for helping to monitor for lead and copper in your drinking water. This sampling is 
required by the federal and state Safe Drinking Water Acts, and is being accomplished with 
the cooperation of homeowners, residents, and water system customers. 

It is important that you follow these instructions so we obtain an accurate measurement of the 
lead and copper in your drinking water. This sample should represent the water you would 
typically drink and the faucet from where you drink the water. Select a faucet for sampling 
that was used the day before you intend to sample. Call your water supply if you have 
questions. 

1 . Water must sit idle in the pipes for an extended length of time before sampling. 

Therefore, do not use any water in the house for at least 6 hours before sampling. The 
best times to sample are early morning or after returning from work. 

2. Select an unfiltered/untreated faucet in the KITCHEN or BATHROOM that is commonly 
used for drinking. DO NOT sample from a laundry sink or a hose spigot as these samples 
cannot be used for compliance. DO NOT use a faucet that has a filter attached to it 
unless you bypass the filter. DO NOT use a faucet that is connected to a home water 
treatment device (like a water softener, iron filter, reverse osmosis) unless you bypass the 
home water treatment device. 

3. Place the open sample bottle below the faucet and gently open the COLD water tap. If 
you have a single handle faucet, turn it fully to the COLD side. Fill the sample bottle to 
the neck with the “first draw" of COLD water. 

4. Tightly cap the sample bottle and place in the sample kit provided. Review the sample kit 
label to ensure all information contained on the label is complete and correct. 

5. Answer the questions on the back of this form and sign the form. 

6. Attach this form to the bottle and leave it outside your front door for pick-up. 

7. Thank you again for your help. We will send you your individual results within 30 days of 
receiving them from the laboratory. A summary of information on this year’s lead and 
copper monitoring will be printed in the annual water quality report that will be made 
available by July 1 of next year. Contact your water supply if you have questions.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 28-29, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted the formal 
plumbing evaluation of Flint Community Schools’ Northwestern High School and 
Southwestern Classical Academy. On December 29-30 staff from DEQ and DLARA 
then performed the follow-up sampling of the drinking fountains and faucets that are 
used for consumptive purposes at these two facilities. This completes the initial 
evaluation process for all 13 schools of the Flint Community Schools. Once the Flint 
Community Schools has had an opportunity to incorporate the recommendations in the 
plumbing evaluation reports, a follow-up sampling will be scheduled to ensure that all of 
the issues have been properly addressed. 

Evaluations of the Flint Community Schools will continue to be posted to the Flint water 
Web site: www.mi.gov/flintwater . These reports are being shared with Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab first and then posted. So far, three reports have 
been posted, with the remaining reports expected to be completed by the end of 
January 2016. 

A list of schools and childcare facilities served by the Flint water system requesting a 
plumbing evaluation has been created. These facilities will be contacted during the first 
two weeks in January to schedule a free plumbing evaluation of their facilities. The 
protocol used will be the same one used for the Flint Community Schools. To date, 
there are a total of 10 facilities that have requested a plumbing evaluation. Once these 
10 facilities have been scheduled, efforts will be made to reach out to additional facilities 
that may wish to take advantage of this free program. 

Video footage was taken on December 29, 2015, of the plumbing evaluation process 
and the sampling protocol of the drinking fountains and faucets at Flint Community 
Schools’ Northwestern H igh School and Southwestern Classical Academy. This 
footage is being used to create a video that provides an easy-to-understand explanation 
of how the plumbing evaluations and subsequent sampling is being done in the schools. 
The target audience for this video is primarily the residents of Flint so that they can get 
a visual of the efforts already underway, but it is anticipated that this video will also be 
used as an instructional aid for schools elsewhere in Michigan that are interested in 
having their facilities evaluated. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report. 

Concerns: 


There are no new concerns to report.

Significant Event : 

On December 29, 201 5, Dan Wyant resigned his position as Director of the DEQ. DNR 
Director Keith Creagh has been appointed Interim Director of the DEQ. Reports have 
been created and meetings have been scheduled to provide Director Creagh with a 
history of the Flint situation as well as current plans for moving forward. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

® The Flint water Web site has been redesigned. The old site was beginning to 
become cluttered and information was becoming difficult to locate. The new 
design provides a more user friendly interface and has a more elegant flow. It is 
anticipated that the redesigned Web site will go live during the week of January 4, 
2016. 

® The DEQ Laboratory identified a lead result as being alarmingly high. This result 
was conveyed to Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian so that the 
customer could be contacted instead of waiting for the final report to go out. 
Investigation of the address revealed that the sample was taken at the Whaley 
Children’s Center. The facility was contacted, and the contact there was notified 
that one of the samples that they submitted was in excess of 2,500 parts per 
billion (ppb), or more than 160 times higher than the federally-mandated action 
level of 1 5 ppb. The contact was instructed to take measures to ensure that 
water from that point was not being used for consumptive purposes. Since the 
facility provided childcare, Mr. Krisztian described the free plumbing evaluation 
service available and offered to put Whaley Children’s Center on the list of 
facilities being evaluated. The contact indicated that they would provide the 
information to management for consideration. 

® A review of the results from the free lead testing offered to all Flint residents 
since November 1, 2015, show a downward trend compared to results from 
those prior to November 1 , 201 5. This can be attributed to a number of factors. 
The switch to using water from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, the 
implementation of supplemental phosphate addition, and the colder temperatures 
are all possible contributing factors in this trend. 

Since November 1, 2015, a total of 298 samples have been submitted and 
analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory. Of these samples, 248 or 83.2% show 
concentrations of 5 ppb or less. In addition, 279 samples or 93.6% show 
concentrations at or below the action level of 15 ppb. 

While this data is encouraging and indicates that the Flint water supply is moving 
towards compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), it is imperative to 
view this data cautiously. The LCR specifies what sampling points may be used 
for compliance purposes. The data for these samples is nonselective and 



FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 3 


potentially may not be coming from distribution points that would be allowed 
under the LCR. In addition, although the paperwork indicates that samples 
should not go through a filter, it is possible that some residents are using the free 
lead testing service to ensure the filters that have been provided do, in fact, 
remove lead. 

Other Item : 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing data for samples submitted by Flint residents 
through the free lead testing program.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


Key Actions : 

On December 28-29, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted the formal 
plumbing evaluation of Flint Community Schools’ Northwestern High School and 
Southwestern Classical Academy. On December 29-30 staff from DEQ and DLARA 
then performed the follow-up sampling of the drinking fountains and faucets that are 
used for consumptive purposes at these two facilities. This completes the initial 
evaluation process for all 13 schools of the Flint Community Schools. Once the Flint 
Community Schools has had an opportunity to incorporate the recommendations in the 
plumbing evaluation reports, a follow-up sampling will be scheduled to ensure that all of 
the issues have been properly addressed. 

Evaluations of the Flint Community Schools will continue to be posted to the Flint water 
Web site: www.mi.gov/flintwater . These reports are being shared with Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab first and then posted. So far, three reports have 
been posted, with the remaining reports expected to be completed by the end of 
January 2016. 

A list of schools and childcare facilities served by the Flint water system requesting a 
plumbing evaluation has been created. These facilities will be contacted during the first 
two weeks in January to schedule a free plumbing evaluation of their facilities. The 
protocol used will be the same one used for the Flint Community Schools. To date, 
there are a total of 10 facilities that have requested a plumbing evaluation. Once these 
10 facilities have been scheduled, efforts will be made to reach out to additional facilities 
that may wish to take advantage of this free program. 

Video footage was taken on December 29, 2015, of the plumbing evaluation process 
and the sampling protocol of the drinking fountains and faucets at Flint Community 
Schools’ Northwestern H igh School and Southwestern Classical Academy. This 
footage is being used to create a video that provides an easy-to-understand explanation 
of how the plumbing evaluations and subsequent sampling is being done in the schools. 
The target audience for this video is primarily the residents of Flint so that they can get 
a visual of the efforts already underway, but it is anticipated that this video will also be 
used as an instructional aid for schools elsewhere in Michigan that are interested in 
having their facilities evaluated. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report. 

Concerns: 


There are no new concerns to report.

Significant Event : 

On December 29, 201 5, Dan Wyant resigned his position as Director of the DEQ. DNR 
Director Keith Creagh has been appointed Interim Director of the DEQ. Reports have 
been created and meetings have been scheduled to provide Director Creagh with a 
history of the Flint situation as well as current plans for moving forward. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

® The Flint water Web site has been redesigned. The old site was beginning to 
become cluttered and information was becoming difficult to locate. The new 
design provides a more user friendly interface and has a more elegant flow. It is 
anticipated that the redesigned Web site will go live during the week of January 4, 
2016. 

® The DEQ Laboratory identified a lead result as being alarmingly high. This result 
was conveyed to Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian so that the 
customer could be contacted instead of waiting for the final report to go out. 
Investigation of the address revealed that the sample was taken at the Whaley 
Children’s Center. The facility was contacted, and the contact there was notified 
that one of the samples that they submitted was in excess of 2,500 parts per 
billion (ppb), or more than 160 times higher than the federally-mandated action 
level of 1 5 ppb. The contact was instructed to take measures to ensure that 
water from that point was not being used for consumptive purposes. Since the 
facility provided childcare, Mr. Krisztian described the free plumbing evaluation 
service available and offered to put Whaley Children’s Center on the list of 
facilities being evaluated. The contact indicated that they would provide the 
information to management for consideration. 

® A review of the results from the free lead testing offered to all Flint residents 
since November 1, 2015, show a downward trend compared to results from 
those prior to November 1 , 201 5. This can be attributed to a number of factors. 
The switch to using water from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, the 
implementation of supplemental phosphate addition, and the colder temperatures 
are all possible contributing factors in this trend. 

Since November 1, 2015, a total of 298 samples have been submitted and 
analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory. Of these samples, 248 or 83.2% show 
concentrations of 5 ppb or less. In addition, 279 samples or 93.6% show 
concentrations at or below the action level of 15 ppb. 

While this data is encouraging and indicates that the Flint water supply is moving 
towards compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), it is imperative to 
view this data cautiously. The LCR specifies what sampling points may be used 
for compliance purposes. The data for these samples is nonselective and 



FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

potentially may not be coming from distribution points that would be allowed 
under the LCR. In addition, although the paperwork indicates that samples 
should not go through a filter, it is possible that some residents are using the free 
lead testing service to ensure the filters that have been provided do, in fact, 
remove lead. 

Other Item : 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing data for samples submitted by Flint residents 
through the free lead testing program.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 


NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

A four-month plan has been developed, listing the priorities to be accomplished for the 
remainder of EM Coulter’s term and beyond. 

The city is contemplating a lawsuit against the pension funds’ actuary. 

PA 345 pension system millage of six mills will be on the November 2015 ballot. This is 
the second time PA 345 is going before Lincoln Park voters. 

The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $100K General Fund operating surplus. The city 
has a General Fund deficit from previous years. EM Coulter will be submitting a Deficit 
Elimination Plan to Treasury. 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015, shows a further decline in pension 
funding down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes were implemented in July 2015 and will reduce annual retiree 
healthcare costs from $4.1M to $600K. 

On August 10, 2015, the Lincoln Park Retiree Associations filed a lawsuit against the 
State of Michigan, Department of Treasury, and the City of Lincoln Park regarding the 
reduction of city retiree healthcare. 

Mathew Coppler, City Manager of Enfield, Connecticut, accepted the position of City 
Manager. His contract has been finalized and he will begin work October 1, 2015.

Lincoln Park (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 15 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $636K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - $1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Last May voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal by 
a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative plan under provisions of PA 345 of 1927 to create a Board of Trustees to 
manage and operate the retirement system. A request for up to six mills per year to fund 
public safety pensions will be placed on the November ballot. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Increase and stabili z e pension funding levels. 

Permanently eliminate structural deficit for future fiscal years. 


FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The Detroit City Council reconsidered the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s 
proposed FY 16 water and sewer rate increase and approved it on July 21, 2015. This 
action eliminated a potential budget deficit, which was a concern raised by the State 
Treasurer in his July 2, 2015 letter to the city. 

The city issued its FY 14 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) on June 30, 
2015 (following two three-month extensions granted by the State Treasurer). The city 
continued to have a deficit for FY 14 as that year closed prior to the bankruptcy 
confirmation in December 2014. The city expects to report a surplus in its FY 15 CAFR, 
which is currently underway and expected to be completed no later than March 2016. 

At the FRC’s July 27, 2015 meeting, the city indicated it would reduce its bankruptcy 
exit financing debt by $30M (from $275M to $245M) prior to its scheduled syndication 
in mid-August. The State Treasurer and FRC Executive Director are participating in the 
city’s rating agency and investor presentations to discuss the State’s oversight role. 

On July 29 and July 30, 2015, the city received its first post-bankruptcy credit ratings 
from S&P and Moody’s. Only S&P rated the city’s exit financing, for which it received 
an investment-grade “A” rating, with a stable outlook. The exit financing is secured by a 
statutory lien on city income tax revenue. Both rating agencies provided the city with 
updated underlying General Obligation (GO) ratings. S&P assigned a “B” rating, with a 
stable outlook. Moody’s upgraded the city from “B3” to “B2,” with a positive outlook. 



Page 3 


Detroit (continued) 

Significant Action/Issues 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the FRC on May 28, 
2015. The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements since its 
appointment in November 2014. The FRC will file its second biannual report in 
December 2015. 

The city submitted its Four- Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 


RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The City Council has approved a new, four-year collective bargaining agreement with the 
police bargaining unit. Treasury reviewed the tentative agreements and had a number of 
concerns with the terms including the identification of over $237 K in increased costs in 
Year 1. Despite these concerns, the RTAB voted 2 to 1 to ratify the approval of these 
collective bargaining agreements. 

The city wishes to seek bids for retiree health insurance coverage after being informed by 
Blue Cross that a 23% rate increase of $644K will become effective October 1, 2015. 
The RTAB has approved this request and Treasury is working with the city to identify 
potential legal ramifications in the lawsuit with retirees if coverage is changed to a new 
provider. 

The city was informed by Blue Cross that a billing oversight has resulted in the city 
underpaying for insurance coverage for retirees in the amount of $853K. 

The city received a $1.2M Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant, 
which will allow them to retain six firefighters over the next two years. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
The RTAB approved this item on August 5, 2015. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury is participating in the selection 
process. The City Council will be interviewing the finalists for the position in August 
2015. 

Completion of the bond tender process is projected for August 2015. The 2015 
Refunding Bonds will be rated Single A, due to the city’s pledge of distributable state 
aid. 



Page 4 


Standard & Poor’s released its rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the 
bond tender release. The city’s long-term rating for the existing bonds was downgraded 
with a negative outlook. The downgrade of these bonds is similar to the rating by 
Standard and Poor’s on the City of Detroit’s DWSD tender refinancing. 



Page 5 


Allen Park (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. A Settlement Conference was held between all parties on July 20, 2015, but no 
resolution was achieved. The court has ordered mediation proceedings. 

The city’s current budget is balanced. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city completed its move to a new temporary City Hall on June 8, 2015. 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on May 26, 2015, and the RTAB approved 
this action on June 3, 2015. 

- Inquiries are being made to add one member to the RTAB. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
Recent Developments 

On August 3, 2015, the City Commission adopted a resolution requesting a hearing with 
the Department of Treasury to discuss financial assistance for decisions made during the 
tenure of emergency managers that resulted in legal fees and settlement costs. 

- TAt-Large Commissioner Mary Donald passed away on June 12, 2015. On August 10, 
2015, the City Commission appointed Edward Isom to finish her unexpired term, which 
ends December 31, 2015. On August 11, 2015, the RTAB approved the appointment. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB was conducted on July 29, 2015. It will be 
sent to the RTAB for review. 

The City Commission adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 15, 2015. The RTAB approved 
this action on June 22, 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange brought a Whistleblower and 
Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former EM Tony 
Saunders. Mediation took place on July 17, 2015, with Jon March of Miller Johnson 
serving as the mediator. No settlement was reached. 



Page 6 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The city has completed a balanced five-year financial plan. One challenge includes the 
outsourcing of fire services which must be realized soon to keep the financial plan 
solvent. This is the first time the city has proposed a viable path out of receivership. 

The degree of State oversight may be reduced if the city can convincingly show a 
commitment to the cost saving measures they have promised. 

The RTAB approved the city’s choice for city controller at the August meeting. Tim 
Sadowski will commence work later this month. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. 
Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1.8M in FY 15 to $2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 Budget. To balance 
the budget, the city increased an existing PA 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 


Flint 

RTAB Appointed: April 29, 2015 

RTAB Members: Frederick Headen, Brian Farkin, David McGhee, Beverly Walker- Griffea, 
Robert McMahan 

Recent Developments 

At a special meeting held on August 11, 2015, the City Council approved the transfer of 
$323K from the Fire Department to the Police Department to hire five additional patrol 
officers. The RTAB approved this transfer on August 12, 2015. 

On August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Court invalidated the city’s 35 percent water 
and sewer rate increases which were reverted back to 2011 rates. This decision could 
potentially could cost the City’s General Fund up to $50M. The city expects to receive a 
final order from the Circuit Court on August 17, 2015, and is prepared to file an 
emergency appeal to the Court of Appeals. The City Administrator has instituted hiring 
and spending freezes across all departments, and Treasury is working with the city to 
identify the impact from this decision. 

In addition, on August 7, 2015, Genesee County Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an 
emergency injunction that prevents the city from further charging water service fees, 
instituted on all water bills to recoup funds used to settle a 2007 lawsuit. The ruling 
requires the city to repay $15.7M from the General Fund to the Water Fund. The ruling 
also prohibits the city from disconnecting water service for late payment and prevents the 
city from placing liens on property for past due water bills. The city plans to appeal this 
decision. 



Page 7 


Flint (continued) 

Recent Developments (continued) 

The City Council approved an amendment to the EM adopted FY 15 Budget on June 29, 
2015. The city ended FY 15 with an estimated $495K General Fund balance. The 
RTAB denied the budget amendment at their July 15, 2015 meeting because the City 
Council also approved the use of $200K of the city’s $495K General Fund balance for 
grass and weed abatement throughout the city. The City Council reconsidered and 
adopted the budget amendments, which were approved by the RTAB on August 12, 
2015. The City Administrator has also developed a plan to allocate additional resources 
toward grass and weed abatement. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB approved the issuance of an Obsolete Property 
Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) certificate for a downtown property. The City Council had 
initially rejected issuance of the OPRA certificate but an EM Order permits the RTAB to 
make the final determination on economic development projects. 

On July 15, 2015, the RTAB also approved ballot language for the renewal of the 
Regional Flint Mass Transportation Authority millage. The renewal is proposed for five 
years at the current 0.6 mills per year. This proposal will appear on the November 2015 
ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 2015, to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit. Another 
lawsuit to force the city to purchase water from the City of Detroit was filed in Genesee 
County Circuit Court on July 16, 2015. 

The city’s Economic and Community Development Director is leaving in August 2015. 
Current staffing vacancies also include the City Treasurer and the Human Resources 
Director. 

As a result of a recent review, the State Tax Commission notified the city that it must 
maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with statute and State Tax 
Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions necessary. In addition, 
the city shall implement a full reassessment within a time frame agreed upon with the 
State Tax Commission. The city is preparing to issue an RFP for a reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city installed a $1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. All twelve filters are 
completely installed and will be in use by August 17, 2015. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project commenced on August 10, 2015. 

The KWA pipeline is expected to be completed in June 2016. The two pump stations are 
75% complete and the intake should be completed in August 2015. 



Page 8 


Flint (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Administrator has issued a Corrective Action Plan to the City Clerk to correct a 
number of operational deficiencies that resulted in the wrong election submission dates 
being provided to local candidates. 

On June 12, 2015, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a decision by Genesee 
County Circuit Judge Richard Yuille, who dismissed a claim that the city violated its own 
ordinances when the EM raised water and sewer rates in 201 1. 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to $6M annual expense. 

Hamtramck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city is undertaking a $7M sewer infrastructure improvement project which is eligible 
for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow into the 
sanitary sewers. 

The City is pursuing a third party police study which will help administrators reduce the 
overtime rates. 

A contractor is reassessing both residential and commercial properties. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The RTAB approved this 
action on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long-term capital improvement 
plan. 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtramck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to $4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the EM two-year budget. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

On July 18, 2015, the City Council approved the recommendation of the Local Officer 
Compensation Commission to increase Council’s compensation from $7K to $15K. The 
RTAB approved this action on July 27, 2015. 

Interviews for the Deputy Mayor position are being held in August 2015. 

The city lost the Supreme Court ruling on efforts to demolish the Phoenix Center. 
Treasury is working with the city to move forward with the sale to a private operator 
which frees up $2M in demolition funds. 



Page 9 


Pontiac (continued) 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On June 18, 2015, the City Council adopted the proposed FY 16 Budget and 2015 tax 
rates. The RTAB held a special meeting on June 26, 2015, to approve the proposed FY 
16 Budget and 2015 tax rates. 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the Gray & Company Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary 
private equity fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC 
proceedings, its effects on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with 
Gray’s firm. The Pension Board has withdrawn its pension assets from Gray & Company 
controlled funds. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but 
was denied. On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to appeal to the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

Per the city’s FY 14 audit, the general fund’s accumulated fund balance is approximately 
$5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U.S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 


CONSENT AGREEMENT

The City Manager with the approval of the City Treasurer, hired William Riley, Police 
Chief of Selma, Alabama, to the position of Police Chief. Mr. Riley’s start date was

On June 29, 2015, a tentative agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a 
judgment levy starting with the December 2015 tax roll, for five years, to repay the 
county $4.9M in past due sewer charges. The city would like to postpone the levy until 
2016 and are in discussions with Wayne County.

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

On August 4, 2015, voters approved a renewal of 4.5 mills for general operations. 

The township audit was completed. The auditors recommended that the township submit 
a Deficit Elimination Plan for 2014, select a firm to advise the Township on financial 
matters and perform an inventory of assets. 

A report issued by the Rehmann Group, the township’s financial consultant, noted that 
the township must make budget adjustments of $164,275 to its FY 15 General Fund 
Budget to account for expenditures exceeding revenues in FY 14. The township adopted 
budget amendments on May 28, 2015. 

An Order was issued on June 17, 2015, granting the Consultant broad authority to 
approve expenditures made by the township and ensure that obligations are being paid. 
The Order also gives the Consultant authority to return the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets to MERS. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township. 

Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 Budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. An Order 
was issued May 20, 2015, requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 
prior to authorization.

PA 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

On August 11, 2015, a report was issued by Meadowbrook Insurance on the progress of 
reducing the City’s healthcare costs. When successfully implemented after October 1, 
2015, the $1.4M annual cost of healthcare could be reduced to $630K. 

On July 6, 2015, Wade Trim began duties to operate and maintain the water and sewer 
systems. 

Louis Schimmel was hired on June 29, 2015, to provide consulting services regarding 
water and sewer issues. 

On July 31, 2015, the water and sewer amnesty program expired. City Administrator 
Cathy Square stated the city will work with customers to settle their past due accounts. 
The second phase of emergency loans is tentatively scheduled to take place on September 
24, 2015. It would consist of approximately $4.7M to restructure the city’s three 
outstanding emergency loans and $11.5M to refinance outstanding debt. 

The city has purchased the first quantity of water meters at a cost of $343 K. 

The city issued an RFP in July to contract-out the collection of past due water and sewer 
bills from residential and commercial customers. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On June 29, 2015, the City Council approved a substantial increase in water and sewer 
rates which will allow the city to fund water and sewer operations. 

On May 18, 2015, the City Council adopted a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under MDOT’s jurisdiction in the 
city. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a consultant’s recommendation for an amnesty 
plan for residential customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. The consultant 
has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, the city could 
collect $2.08M. The city has extended the amnesty plan until July 31, 2015. This will 
allow more time for customers to pay past due accounts. 

The city’s liabilities total $99. 9M. Some major components are: $55. 3M debt, including 
$20.7M owed to the DWSD, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits 
(OPEB).

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

On July 21, 2015, the Review Team reported to the Governor that a financial emergency 
existed in the County. 

On July 22, 2015, the Governor confirmed the finding of a financial emergency in Wayne 
County. The County did not request a hearing on the findings as provided for in Public 
Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act. 

On August 6, 2015, the County Commissioners voted to choose the option of a consent 
agreement to address its financial emergency. 

On August 13, 2015, the County Board approved the Consent Agreement negotiated 
between the County Executive and State Treasurer. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

On June 10, 2015, the county reached a settlement with retirees on healthcare. The 
county will no longer provide health insurance but will instead provide a stipend to 
retirees. This will result in a savings of $20M annually. 

On June 17, 2015, the Wayne County Executive requested a preliminary review under 
the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, Public Act 436 of 2012. After notification 
to the county. Treasury began its preliminary review of the County’s finances on June 19, 
2015. A final preliminary review report was issued on June 30, 2015. 

On July 1, 2015, the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board met and found 
that probable financial stress exists in the county. 

The county’s annual structural General Fund deficit is approximately $52M prior to any 
of the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $53M in General Fund savings, 
$25M of which comes from changes to pension and healthcare benefits for active 
employees and healthcare benefits for retirees. The county has not yet proposed a long- 
term solution to its jail problems.

Flint 

Water rate hike 

Emergency Manager Darnell Earley has been forced to go on the defensive regarding the proposed increases over the 
upcoming years in the water usage rates. Water rates are a really hot button issue here, due to the increase in flat fees 
for infrastructure waste and sewage. Darnell wrote a piece that appeared in the Flint Journal outlining the actual rate 
increases and how no substantive changes would be made to fees. As a result the expected increases would be less. 
Public sentiment is still strongly in the camp of water rates in Flint being too high as is, and the expectation was that 
joining the Karengondi Water Authority would help lower costs.

Treasurer's Governor's Memorandum 3-15-13.docm 


Governor, 



Some of the items I don't like in the attached are: 

It says we will meet with EMs over the next couple months, it won't take that long. 

Flint summary says no near term exit despite Governor and Mayor's contrary wishes. I will dig into this more 
deeply and report back. KWA misrepresented based on my mtg w engineering firm this week. Report I got is 
that Flint should stay w DWSD. 



Regards, 

Andy

• Update : The City of Flint has been participating with Genesee County on the feasibility 
of the City’s use of a planned water pipe line from Lake Huron that would serve a large 
portion of Genesee County as an alternative to water supplied by DWSD. An engineer- 
ing firm selected by Treasury to conduct an independent evaluation of Flint’s choices for 
water supply presented their findings on December 18 th . This is a critical long-term de- 
cision for Flint and the region. The economics show that but for the excess cost of 
DWSD water during the three year construction period of the Karegnondi Water Authori- 
ty (KWA) pipeline, the City will benefit from lower water costs in the long term by us- 
ing the KWA water and treating the water in Flint at their own, existing, water treatment 
plant. A recent proposal shows that with cooperative efforts with the County, those 
excess costs can be further minimized.
