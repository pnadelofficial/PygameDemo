Good morning 


i have not shared that particular document with hts office, but the fiscal agencies have it-— so no reason for you not to 
share it you want. Also, the formal supplemental request went to the Legislature (including his office) late yesterday 
afternoon, and that would include the breakdown as weli, along with more detail than this sheet.

Subject: Health Endowment Fund 

The Majority Leader would like to request that the Health Endowment Fund cover all or most of the 
State share of the Flint water appropriation. We didn't talk too much about this before the 
supplemental because we didn't want to give a reason for people to delay or vote no. But now that it's 
done, we'd like to do something. If the HEF can give the money to Flint then we should be able to hold 
back some of what we just appropriated, right John? 

Would the Governor or Speaker be interested in joining Arlan in making this request?

Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 

Dear Gov. Snyder, 

I'm writing to voice my displeasure with the lack of communication between your office and mine concerning the water 
crisis in the city of Flint. 

Since I have been in a position to represent my community at the Capitol, i have been in constant contact with your 
office to offer advice, help, partnership and solutions. My community elected me to represent them in Lansing, and i 
have been striving to do just that. Several letters have reached your office, and I have been highly vocal about the need 
to come together to fix the water crisis. This has been done with the understanding that we both care about the people 
of Flint, who I represent in the Legislature, and who you represent as governor of this state. 

I have also reached out to Dr. Eden Weils and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality to be proactive in addressing the issue of lead-laced water damaging the minds 
and bodies of Flint's citizens, especially the children. While this crisis could be solved by switching water sources, the 
problems will remain in the health of our future generation. 

i had hoped that this entire problem would have been addressed through partnership, teamwork and cooperation. It is 
unfortunate that hasn't been the case, It is also unfortunate that common courtesy to my office on being kept up to 
speed with any operational changes and financial solutions has not been timely communicated. 

I will continue to keep the lines of communication open as we address the continued problem of health in Flint, and 1 
hope you will take the opportunity to join me in conversation to find future solutions.

Subject: Re: Goals for Task Force 
Team - 

Please find my initial draft of questions for us to consider, added to Ken’s draft that he circulated 
earlier. 

For our agenda on Wed, I would highlight the importance of: 

1 - OMA/FOIA 

2 - Our need for awareness about others’ assessments in this same space — although there is 
virtually no way that we will be fully aware of all others’ activities (investigatory, journalistic, legal) in 
this arena, being aware of the “official” inquiries may potentially assist us in tapping others’ fact-finding 
(e.g., MDEQ’s internal review to be completed within 30 days). We need a “map” (or perhaps a Venn 
diagram). 


l 



3 - As this is still a new group, it may be helpful for us to take 5 mins to share what, for each of us, 
would represent “success” in the deliverables for this task force. 

An additional question about logistics: 

Are we anticipating the need to keep our own minutes — and if yes, should we rotate that role? Or is 
there the possibility of having a staff member dedicated to this purpose — perhaps from PSC, or the 
Env Council, or my research unit at UM (or elsewhere), with modest support for this purpose from the 
Gov’s office?

Y’all, 

Without having had an opportunity to review Ken’s contribution, I thought I would pass along my initial 
cut at some thoughts on questions / work plan for your review and consideration. I would like to flesh 
this out further but this may give some idea of the questions / approach ideas that arose during my 
weekend reading sessions. 

As for agenda ideas, a few items — some of which have already been noted: 

* Basecamp orientation (5 min) * OMA / FOIA review (already identified) * Protocol for addressing 
issues that may identify potential liabilities * Defining how our review differs/complements/ etc the 
seeming multitude of other reviews * Calendar 

Lastly, a couple of clarifications / apologies regarding Basecamp: 

1 . By way of apology, I live under the illusion that my home is in Chicago and so my computer is set to 
Central Standard Time. On my calendar, our meeting on Wed. shows up as 10:00 a.m. but I think 
Basecamp converted it to 1 1 :00 EST on your machines. My apologies for the confusion — and thanks 
to Ken for the correction. 2. We have set up 2 projects (so far) in Basecamp. The first is just for us — 
the Flint Water Advisory T ask Force (and Rich B.). I thought this might be useful if we wanted to be 
able to have exchanges among the core task force membership. The second project, Flint Water 
Review, includes everyone that was on the earlier distributed roster (and their aides). Sorry for any 
confusion there. 

I will also post the attached to the task force project — and hope to have some further thoughts 
/revisions tomorrow night.

No but 1 emailed you about this yesterday morning when emails starting flying. 

Whoever set up the meeting did not send it to us that i know of. If the meetings will be set up via emails then please ask 
them to copy me/new girl so they make it too your calendar. That said you that interview John Walsh's needs you to do 
from 8-9 am if you can make it to Flint in an hour I can bump Chris and Laura to another day. Scott i should bump to the 
afternoon unless you want to taik by phone since we cancelled the last few.

Just got off the phone with Rich Baird regarding our desire to interview individuals in Flint who had/have 
responsibility for various aspects of managing the Flint Treatment Plant or responsibility in the Department of 
Public Works. The attached letter lists the initial list prepared by Eric Rothstein, It is essential that we have

Subject: Fwd: You may want to invite this lady to your 12/2 meeting to show her your task 

force is transparent 

Happy Thanksgiving all. Looks like there is sneed for a media update. 

You may hear some grumbles about the pre-registration requirement for the Listening Session 12/2 at Mott. This 
was based on logistical considerations - availability, cost, safety and secure parking. Also , to give 40 people 2-3 
minutes to speak will require 80-120 minutes time and this does not lend itself to an open town hall meeting 
format if we are going to effectively listen to and discuss with participants. 

I would suggest that we use funds to record and transcribe these session and a video of it be available on a 
website ,open to the public. See below. 

We will need some help with hosting identifying speakers, bringing the microphone to them , registration , etc 
.Would this be a role for MSU ? This group should make an effort to reflect the diversity of Flint. 

For video recording , consider Paul Herring , Spectacle Productions, 405 University Blvd , Flint, 

11 810-239-2901 office 



If we have more registrants than space , we can put them on the list for subsequent meetings which must occur 
in a timely manner. 

If we consider other sites, consider the requirements for public buildings in regard to open meetings. 

It may be time to officially contact Mayor Weaver about our plans and suggest to the Governor that we need an 
official representative to clarify our role and our intent to not conflict with the Mayor's public meetings. Perhaps 
, we need to be available to attend some of her meetings to listen also. 

Finally, our electrical power was shut off for maintenance that had to be completed before freezing weather so 
phones and computers were down. We will be open for business Monday 12/30. 

We are operating on a tight timeline and will need more resources and some media support to reflect the 
Governor's concern adequately to the citizens of Flint.

I agree with most of her statements and I hope her organization will vigorously share their position with the 
Governor and the legislature.lt is true that the Flint Water Advisory Task Force has a much more limited 
scope as an advisory body and has no legal authority.I hope Common Cause will also do a legal analysis 
of the emergency manager laws policies ,and procedure and inform the public.

It was a real pleasure meeting you and thank you for the incredible work you are doing on behalf of the children in my 
native city. We are committed to working with you on ail fronts to make the way forward the best it could be. Also, I 
want to let you know that I did follow up on whether the former D£Q department leader was still working on water 
related issues. To my surprise you were correct When additional schools needed to be tested she was added to help 
with the workload. I am told she did not supervise, conclude on testing, or anything of that nature but they needed help 
and the director of DEQ. did approve a limited role for her. He is going to be meeting with the IF tomorrow to discuss 
actions underway. I apologize for asserting otherwise as f had not been aware. 

Please call me if I can assist in any way.

Mr. Baird and ail the other guys. 

It was a pleasure meeting everyone and a privilege to present to you ail. As ! said, we have an incredible and unique opportunity to 
mitigate the impact of this population-wide exposure, if we act now, proactively, we can buffer our kids from the life-altering 
impacts of lead poisoning. 

Flint has many claims to fame (we put the world on wheels, we birthed Mr. Baird!, etc); anti now, with your leadership, we can 
continue to build generations of strong, smart, and healthy children. 

If I can be of any further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me. Email or cell

Detroit/Flint Update 

• RB reported that the Flint Water Advisory Board (Eric Rothstein, Dr. Matt Davis, Dr. Larry 

Reynolds, Ken Sikkema, Chris Kolb) has been chosen and will provide an independent review of 
the water situation to determine what got us there in the first place and what can we learn from 
it so it doesn't happen again. The Board is working well together. Flint blames the State for the 
water situation and is a hot box right now.

WHEREAS, the area affected includes parts of the City of Flint, within the 
County of Genesee; and 

WHEREAS, the damaged water infrastructure and leaching of lead into the 
city’s water caused damage to public and private water infrastructure, and has

threat to public health and safety and disrupting vital community services; and 

WHEREAS, from October 1, 2015 to this date, the County of Genesee and

FURTHER, termination of this emergency will occur at such time as the 
threats to public health, safety, and property caused by the emergency no longer 
exist and appropriate programs have been implemented to recover from the 
effects of this emergency, but in no case longer than February 1, 2016, unless

Ms, Natasha L, Henderson, City Administrator 

City o f Flint 

1101 S. Saginaw St. 

Flint, Michigan 48502 

Dear Ms. Henderson: 

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the possibility olfreoonnecting the City of Flint to the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department’s (DWSD) Water Supply system. Director McCormick has asked 
me to respond to you and provide a brief outline of the basis for that reconnection. However, I 
want to again emphasize what Ms. McCormick has previously stated to your City Council on this 
issue: DWSD is willing to sit down and talk with the City of Flint without pre-condition, if that is 
mutually desirable, 

1 would be remiss if I did not point out that oil June 12, 2015, the City of Detroit and the Great 
Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) executed a Lease Agreement that provides for the GLWA's 
operation of the Regional Water Supply System. At present, we are transitioning management of 
the system from DWSD to the GLWA while certain Conditions Precedent of the Lease Agreement 
are satisfied. We have made substantial progress towards satisfying these Conditions Precedent 
with a goal of having GLWA commence full system operations on or before January 1, 2016. I 
can assure you that, like DWSD, the GLWA is concerned with the: challenges Flint’s residents 
have faced in recent months, and will be willing to discuss service to your City. 

That said, here is a likely list of issues that would need to be addressed;: 

1} Rates : In Sue McCormick’s January 12, 2015 letter to Flint, she indicated that the 
rates Flint would pay tor the remainder of the then current 2014-2015 Fiscal Year (FY) 
would be “the same rates Flint was paying as a terminated customer when it left the 
system but modified to include the 4% increase experienced by all other DWSD 
wholesale customers in 2014.” As we are now in the 2015-16 FY, that offer must be 
modified to include an additional adjustment similar to that which was received by other 
customers, In this regard we propose that the rates be adjusted as follows: 

a) Starting with the 2013-2014 FY terminated rate; and 

b) Adding a 4% adjustment to that rate to account for the 20 1 4-20 1 5 FY increases: and 

c) Adding an adjustment equal to the average Suburban Wholesale Charge Adjustment 
for the current 2015-20:16 FY. This rate would remain in place until June 30, 2016, the 
end of the current 2015-2016 FY. 



Ms, Natasha L. Henderson, Oity Administrator 

City of Flint 

September 30, 2015 

Page 2 — . w 


d) Based upon the above considerations, the resulting rale structure is a fixed monthly 

rate of $602,1 00 and a commodity rate of $8.93/Mef for the current 2015-2016 FY. Please 
note that this rate structure is designed to be applicable to incremental water sales over and 
above water sales to the Genesee County Drain water is 

provided to the combined GCDC/Flint customer, alternative rate structures may be 
appropriate. 

e) Additionally, DWSD recently changed its wholesale customer billing methodology as 
follows; Flint’s calculated share of the FY 2016 Budget is allocated 60% to the Fixed 
Monthly Charge and 40% to the Commodity Charge, which is consistent with the 
adopted FY 2015-2016 water wholesale rates 

1) In extending this proposal, our assumption is that the service provided is to Flint only 
and computations are based on data from our previous customer relationship. 

g) It is anticipated that under the management of the GLWA, the rates for the 2016-2017 
FY will be computed using the same methodology as applied to all other Water Supply 
System customers. 

The proposed rate methodology is intended to. ensure that Flint is treated fairly by using the average 
wholesale customer adjustment in the current Fiscal Year, and the same methodology as all other 
customers. 

2) Term: DWSD understands that Flint’s current long-term desire is to receive water 
service from the KWA. Under these circumstances, Flint would be expected to remain a 
DWSD customer from the time of reconnection until the time it begins to receive service 
from KW'A. If Flint wishes to consider a longer term relationship with D WSD or 
GI AVA, we would welcome that discussion. 

3) . Reconnection : As previously indicated, by Ms. McCormick in her January 12, 2015, 
letter, DWSD will not charge an additional fee for Flint to reconnect to the DWSD Water 
System, and is prepared to immediately take those steps necessary on its end to facilitate 
a reconnection. Any expenses incurred would be billed at: actual cost. Because DWSD 
lacks sufficient information on the status of the disconnection, we are unable to provide 
an estimate of those costs at this time, Nonetheless, we will work with you in good faith 
to develop an expedited plan for reconnection, and to develop a mutually agreed good 
faith estimate of the costs associated with that plan. 

Thank you for raising this issue with us. We hope that this letter addresses the concerns you raised 
during your recent conversation with Ms. McCormick, and we sincerely appreciate your interest 
and the opportunity to serve Flint. 





Ms. Natasha L, Henderson, City Administrator 
City of Flint 
September 30, 2015 



Finally, we look forward to the opportunity to meet with you at. your earliest convenience to discuss 
this letter, and how we may best assist Flint in serving its residents* needs. Please contact Ms- 
McCormick's office at (3 1 3) 224-4701 to arrange this meeting. 

Best Regards, 



William M. Wolfson

Flint 

Water rate hike 

Emergency Manager Darnell Earley has been forced to go on the defensive regarding the proposed increases over 
the upcoming years in the water usage rates. Water rates are a really hot button issue here, due to the increase in 
flat fees for infrastructure waste and sewage. Darnell wrote a piece that appeared in the Flint Journal outlining the 
actual rate increases and how no substantive changes would be made to fees. As a result the expected increases 
would be less. Public sentiment is still strongly in the camp of water rates in Flint being too high as is, and the 
expectation was that joining the Karengondi Water Authority would help lower costs.

Man' Beth - I have included Lynne on this email and she can reserve a conference room but I’m not sure that anyone 
from the Governor’s Office will be in it. 1 know Dick is calling in from Grand Rapids and I’m pretty sure that Dennis 
won’t be in the office for the first half, if not the entire call. So they may be coming over here to sit in a conference room 
by themselves.

City of Flint Background Information 



Pursuant to your request I am providing a status report regarding important issues facing the city. 
BUDGET 

The administration anticipates the FY 2013 budget will remain balanced through the end of 
the fiscal year. 

- The current budget reduced the City’s workforce by 150 positions (20 percent). 

- The City’s five year deficit ehmination plan anticipates an emergency loan application of $12 
million to address the $19.3 million accumulated deficit. The remainder of the unrestricted 
accumulated general fund deficit will be eliminated through $7.1 million in reductions. 

- The administration anticipates the FY 2014 will be balanced by making $3 million of 
reductions despite a 14% loss in taxable value. 

- 70% of the General fund expenses are for Police, Fire, 911 and the Court. 

- Ernst & Young will assist the EM is preparing a 5 year financial plan in accordance with 
the DEP. 

POLICE 

Voters approved a 6 mill public safety millage in November and 6 police officers have been 
hired to date and 5 positions still remain to be filled. 

Reorganization of the FPD has reduced response times and increased the rate of solving 
homicides to 70%. 

City successfully allowing out-county units to use the city’s lock up. 

MSP continues to provide 24/7 support to the city and will increase staffing from 18 to 25. 


FIRE 

Average number of fires per day 5-7. 

New Fire Chief hired, former Flint fire employee. 

False alarms are down 75% after EM began billing alarm companies for false alarms 

BLIGHT 

The city has 9,000 vacant structures 
Over 600 structures have been demolished

City is losing demolition money because Consumers Power cannot provide adequate 
manpower to cut & cap due to union issues. 

MSHDA is applying for $100 million in demolition funding for 5 local units including 
Flint. Anticipate work beginning this summer if grant application is successful. 

WATER 

EM signed a resolution to enter into and sign a contract with KWA. 

Water theft is a significant issue and administration plans to address it in the next 90 
days. 

Water rates have been raised 118% over the past 2 years and is an issue with residents 
Effective 7/1/13 EM will eliminate the “readiness to serve charge” ($53) for any water 
customer who meets the state poverty exemption requirements. 

DWSD attempting to cancel current contract with Flint and institute increased charges to 
the city during construction of KWA. 

PENSION 

Overall annual contribution is $17.4million, which has increased as work force has been 
reduced. 

General fund annual contribution is approximately $8 million. 

SOLID WASTE COLLECTION 

- City outsourced collection of solid waste during March 2013, the low bidder hired 20 
former DPW employees and the transition has been seamless. The firm will provide 
recycling this summer. 

OPEB LAWSUIT 

- A Federal District Judge recently granted (6 retirees) plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary 
injunction in response to changes implemented to retiree healthcare by the former EM. This 
action stops the modifications to the City of Flint’s retirees’ health care benefits from going 
into effect. 

MAYOR AND COUNCIL 

The EM has restored the Mayor’s salary and intends to reinstate the salary of city council. 
Council’s restoration will be predicated upon complying with certain criteria (training, 
active cooperation with the EM and consideration of major city initiatives i.e. master 
plan, KWA). 



The City of Flint continues to face challenges from an extended economic downturn which has resulted in 
continued significant decline in property valuations, population loss and an aging infrastructure 

► Economic headwinds 

► Property valuations have decreased 50% since 2002 to from ~$1,800 million to ~$900 million in 2012 

► The City's population has declined 18% to 102,434 in 2010 since 2000 

► The housing vacancy rate is 21% 

► The owner occupied housing rate is 45% 

► Retiree related expenses escalating 

► The City of Flint currently provides healthcare benefits for 1,560 retirees costing approximately $17,000 per employee 

► On March 29 th , a Detroit Federal District Court judge issued a temporary injunction against changes to retiree healthcare 
benefits 

► 1,741 individuals participate in the City's pension plans. All retiree pension plans are expected to be transferred from the Flint 
Employees' Retirement System to the Michigan Employees' Retirement System 

► The current unfunded OPEB liability stands at $367 million as of June 30, 2012 and the Pension UAAL stands at ~$268 million as of 
2010 actuary report. 

► Increased property tax millage and fees proposed to result in $25 million of additional revenue to balance FY 2012 budget 

► 25% increase in Water and Sewer rates 

► 6 mill property tax increase for Fire and Police to provide funding in lieu of lost grant revenue 

► Special assessment for street lighting 

► Addition of waste collection fee to replace existing millage 

► $21 million reduction in personnel expenses for FY 2013 budget intended to balance the budget 

► $17 million reduction through wage concessions and headcount reduction 

► Budget assumes 20% reduction across all bargaining units although only 3 of 6 BU's have agreed to date 

► $4 million savings from converting the pre-65 retiree health benefit plan to the active's plan and transferring post-65 retirees to 
Medicare Advantage (these changes are subject to the temporary injunction)

While leadership has implemented changes that will begin to shape Flint's future, a long-term view must be canvassed 
to determine required levels of reinvestment resulting in an improved quality of life ("QOL") for citizens 


Short-term fiscal changes 

The City of Flint has made many fiscal changes to balance the 
budget and reduce the deficit including: 

• Increasing certain taxes and fees to cover the operating 
costs of Flint's core services 

• Reducing headcount 

• Working with labor and sharing sacrifice across pension 
and healthcare benefits to generate savings 

• Updating IT infrastructure as well as reviewing back-office 
and shared services to drive efficiency 


Investing for a sustainable future 


Attracting Population 


Long-term reinvestment for sustainable future 

The City's 5-year plan must now turn towards sustainability to 
ensure the long-term plan will be in the best interest of the 
citizens 

• What levels of reinvestment in infrastructure and 
community development will attract jobs and population 
growth? 

• When and how should capital be deployed to maintain 
fiscal stability and foster change 

• What additional changes can be made to provide the 
necessary capital for reinvestment?

Agreed, though I think there's going to need to be couple of topline message points that get to 
Treasurer's review process very generally (ala Ron Fonger's piece that pointed out that one community is 
going to lose while another "wins" regardless of the outcome). Doesn't sound like Detroit may take lighlty 
if that ends up being outcome. 

We also do need a comms/outreach plan to make sure we've got all components and notification bases 
covered.

Here is the start of some topline messages for Flint ... I don't think that we need to get 
too deep into the specifics on the deal, we can leave that to Ed and others to 
discuss. Please let me know of any suggestions and additions that you have. I plan to 
also put together some background information that we can have on hand when 
discussing the topic. As I mentioned before, it likely won't be until the week of Apr 8 th 
that we discuss this publicly. 


• This is a decision made by the City of Flint and is a local decision that 
affects their local water supply. 


l 




• Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz has heavily involved the city's elected 
officials throughout the decision-making process and all agree that this is 
best for the citizens and businesses in Flint. 

• This will save Flint at least $100 million over the next 25 years, and 
possibly as much as $300 million. 

• The Departments of Treasury and Environmental Quality have approved 
the financial and environmental soundness of KWA's plan. 

• Flint accounts for only 2% of DWSD's capacity. 


Thanks, 

Caleb

Dayne Walling posted the following on his campaign Web site and I'm writing about it today. 

Can we got a comment from your office? 

Thanks, 


Friend, 

Access to clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human right. 

That’s why I just sent Gov. Snyder my Flint Water Improvement Plan. It focuses on the areas of safety, quality, access, 
investment and education. My letter urges the governor to quickly implement these ideas so that Flint’s water is 100% 
safe. 

Please contact Gov. Snyder by calling (517) 335-6397 (or by clicking here) and ask him to take action immediately 
to implement my plan and ensure Flint’s water is safe. 

My plan offers new ideas and also builds on successful models of utility, energy and assistance programs at the state and 
federal levels. Flere is my plan: 

Safety & Quality 

* 100% Safety is the standard 

. City of Flint releases testing data to assure safety and expands testing to households with support from the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality 

„ Support alternatives for those advised not to drink the water by their doctors through the Michigan Health Endowment Fund and community partners to 
protect the vulnerable like seniors and infants 

„ Bring on experienced river water treatment operational management in the City of Flint 
„ Require water testing data to be released quarterly by law in all Michigan communities 
Access 

* Announce an amnesty program for turn-ons and reduce the turn-on cost in Flint 

„ Develop a revised payment plan policy to allow customers to come back on to the Flint system 

* New Federal and State partnership to establish new Drinking Water Emergency Assistance Fund for customers (modeled on Federal and State energy 
utility programs: Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; Michigan Energy Assistance Program; State Emergency Relief) 


Investment 




Accelerate water system improvements outlined in the City of Flint Capital Improvement Plan through Federal and State Investments 


9 State approves City of Flint's Distressed Cities Fund applications 
„ Federal and State forgiveness of payment to Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund 
, Federal and State financing for future improvements 

„ City Water Department implements budgeted FY15 projects including leak detection, valve repairs, new pipes and meter replacements 
Education 

„ Develop a community partnership to provide household and business customers with information on testing and conservation 

„ Ongoing partnership with Michigan Department of Human Services, United Way, Salvation Army and community organizations to provide information 
on water assistance 

. Expand youth energy initiative to assist households with conservation and efficiency (piloted in summer 2014 with Northwestern High School students, 
EcoWorks and Consumers Energy) 

The struggle with our water has gone on for too long. The state must take action and do its part. 

Please ask Gov. Snyder to take action immediately to implement my plan and ensure Flint’s water is safe. 

Thank you for your ongoing support. 

Sincerely, 

Dayne 

P.S. -- Please send this to friends and family so they can take action too!

Thanks, Brad. 


Exactly. I'm going to refer them to the city for any questions about the cost of turning water back on or anything else 
having to do with the cost of water. 


Under State Emergency Relief, DHS can pay up to $200 to reconnect water for households that meet eligibility 
standards, plus $175 for bills in arrearage that need to be paid to get the water turned back on. I can tell the reporter 
that.

Thanks for the loop in, DEQ oversees the quality of the water through our drinking water program. What the residents

Hi Randy, 


This should definitely come to me to answer rather than being answered at the local office. I'm CC'ing Brad Wurfel from

We can tell her how much SER funding is available, but I don't think we're the ones who could or should say how much it 
costs for water, how much it costs to turn the water back on and/or why people in Flint are without water.

Angie Hendershot would like to interview someone from this office regarding what the State pays for SER towards water 
bills. Turn on fees and the like. ABC 12 is doing a story about the water issues in Flint and the piece their interested in 
now is about the cost of the water and how much it costs and why so many people are without water. Then what it 
costs to get the water back on. 


Do you want us to refer her to you or talk to her locally. I would have to discuss this with Sandi Mose, because SER is in 
her area.

Subject: Flint Water System Update 

After speaking with Andy, Dan, Dennis and John, we have a plan for the next steps in Flint's request to 
participate in the KWA with Genesee County. Here is what we can confirm publicly, although unless it's 
a permitting question, we should have Treasury (Terry or I) answer any inquiries. 

Ed Kurtz will submit a resolution to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to the Treasurer, likely 
today. Once I receive word that we have officially received, we can confirm that we have it and the 
Treasurer will thoroughly review the resolution and perform due diligence before making a 
decision. Under PA 436, the State Treasurer must approve contracts over $50,000 that were not 
competitively bid. 

No date has been set for the Treasurer to complete his review, but, he is fully aware of the tight 
timelines necessary to get approvals for the upcoming construction season, and will conduct his review 
accordingly. 

That is all we can confirm publicly through next week. Just so you are aware, and not for public 
consumption, a call was placed to DWSD to let them know that Ed Kurtz was submitting his request and 
that if they have a final best offer that they should submit it very soon. This may prompt them to go to 
the media, or not, but be prepared if you get a call from that angle. 

We need to develop some talking points for the following week, when Andy makes his determination. I 
will try to put together a draft by the end of the day and send it around for review. If anyone has 
anything they would like me to add, feel free to send it my way. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi guys - 

Just wanted to loop back and check in re: timing on this issue. Last understanding was that was under 
close review by state treasurer and that soonest decision would be made is end of this week, beginning 
of next. 

As you're both out this week (©), just want to make sure we have a mechanism in place to coordinate 
with us in Gov's comm office as soon as know timing and plan so we can be ready with messaging and 
any outreach that may be needed. Sounds like this will be contentious one way or the other regardless 
of the determination so just trying to make sure we're prepared as possible. 

Please advise. Thanks!

I spoke with both (separately) after the call. They both indicated that they had a good conversation, and that they 
sincerely look forward to working with the other in good faith over the next couple years. 

Kevyn indicated that he would follow up with Sue McCormack, and that his direction will be that there be no more 
talking to the press about the issue. Ed plans to stay silent on the deal until Monday, at which time he will address the 
issue in a matter of fact matter, and stay away from any divisive language regarding the issue.

I. Introduction 


A. Recognize Council 

B. Family 

C. Elected Officials incl newest Representative Phelps 

Good afternoon and welcome. Thank you for joining me here today at my fifth annual 
State of the City address. 

Thank City Council President, City Council members and City Clerk for hosting... 

As I mentioned, this is my fifth annual State of the City address. If I had been elected 
and re-elected under normal circumstances, then this would be the first state of the city 
address of my second full term. But we know that these past 5 years have been 
everything except normal. Economic, financial, political and social challenges as great 
as this City has ever seen have met us every morning as we have worked tirelessly 
through the day and night to comeback from the worst economic downtown in a century, 
to push back against a crime wave that carried us to the top of the worst list in the 
country to be on, to keep everyone here at City Hall working in the best interests of the 
public, residents and taxpayers despite conflicting opinions about collective bargaining 
agreements, local home rule, and city service standards. 

Nevertheless, we continue to come together, to this sacred public place. I thank Elder 
Sanders for the invocation. Many of us do what we do each day because of our faith. 

We know that we are each called to be here in this place at this time for a purpose. ! 
want to recognize all of the pastors and faith leaders who are here today. Please stand 
and let us recognize you for your leadership and service. 

I am thankful every day for the opportunity--and strength--to serve as your mayor in 
these difficult times. I am also personally thankful every day for the wonderful family that 
surrounds and supports me...

I want to recognize our elected officials who have joined me here today... 

Note newest State Rep Phil Phelps 

I also want to recognize Flint’s EM Darnell Earley and all of the City of Flint officials who 
have taken time to be here this afternoon. Thank you. 



II. State of the City Summary: “Smaller yet Stronger and Smarter' 1 

A. Citizen Priorities 

B. 2013 Accomplishments & Challenges (City Govt and Community) 

C. Adoption of Master Plan 

D. Key Project Highlights 

a. General Motors & UAW: Paint Shop 

b. SC2: White House Domestic Policy Council 

c. Michigan State University: Medical School 

d. Lavarne Ross, Flint Heritage Exhibit at FIA 

When I look back over my first four years in office compared with where we are today, I 
believe that the State of the City of Flint is that we are smaller yet stronger and smarter. 
Flint is smaller yet stronger and smarter in 2014. 

As an example, last year’s budget which ended last June, was balanced through a 
mixture of significant revenue increases, significant expenditure decreases, and steps 
taken to reduce long term costs. Expenditure reductions included elimination of 20 
percent of the City’s workforce, compensation decreases equivalent to a 20 percent 
wage reduction for remaining employees, and the restructuring of health and retirement 
benefits. 

The financial statements as of June 30, 2013 show that revenues exceeded expenses 
in the General Fund by $6.3 million. And more people are paying their taxes. Delinquent 
collection efforts focus not only on income tax but on personal property tax and 
miscellaneous receivables. Since, the establishment of new enforcement efforts last 
year, $451,196 has been collected in total for delinquent taxes and personal property 
taxes. 

All of this resulted in the City’s accumulated general fund deficit being reduced to less 
than $12.9 million as of June 30, 201 3. We have a long way to go but progress is being 
made. Flint is smaller yet stronger and smarter in 2014. 



The current budget was designed and implemented with the same goals in mind - 
operating within the constraints of available revenues; restructuring operations and cost 
factors to enhance future financial stability, and continuing to reduce the remaining 
deficit. The budget includes reducing the deficit by a minimum of $1 million. As of 
January 31 , 2014, seven months into the FY14 year, revenues and expenses are on 
target. 

Nevertheless, there remains a list of critical challenges and threats that must be 
resolved but today there are 7 items on the list instead of more like 27. The proposed 
transition management plan calls for action on a deficit elimination plan, a five-year 
financial analysis and two-year budget, governance reforms, organizational 
development, legacy cost reduction, adoption of a strategic plan, and ongoing 
sustainability around training, best-practices and planning. 

Myself and all of the City Council members are engaged with the Emergency Manager 
Darnell Earley, staff and consultants in order to address these challenges and threats 
as fully and quickly as possible. I compliment the steps taken by the City Council’s 
Finance Committee towards putting in place a City of Flint Strategic Plan at their 
meeting this past week. This is the kind of leadership that is going to achieve the goal of 
transition to home rule that I set in this address last year. 

While the challenges are serious, we also have significant accomplishments from 2013 
to build on. 

The Law Office is one area that has dramatically improved in recent years under the 
leadership of City Attorney Peter Bade. As an example, during 2013, we had numerous 
litigation successes, with lawsuits against the City either dismissed or settled at low 
cost. We stayed under budget for suits and settlements, and are at a historic low for 
what we spend on litigation going back 15 years. This is due in large part to the Law 
Office handling cases directly. Presently, there are 1 1 1 active litigation matters. Only 5 


7 



matters are being handled by outside counsel in partnership with a staff attorney. We 
have met or bettered the 95% of litigation being handled by staff attorneys for the past 
four years. This is responsible management that serves taxpayers and the City of Flint. 

Another accomplishment is the master plan. Last year in the State of the City I set a 
goal of adopting a new comprehensive master plan for Flint in 2013. In October, with 
the unanimous support of the Flint Planning Commission and the Flint City Council, 
Flint’s first comprehensive master plan since 1960 was adopted! That item had been on 
the to-do list for my whole life — and now we are in a position to move forward with clear 
alignment among our vision, guiding principles, goals, objectives, strategies, resources 
and metrics. 

More than 5,000 volunteers and engaged citizens were the driving force in Flint’s 
master planning process. I am so proud of the way people dedicated thousands upon 
thousands of hours to imagining a better Flint and deciding on strategies to make our 
vision a reality. 

Think about the math of public participation here. At one event alone, the community 
visioning workshop last March at Mott Community College, there were nearly 500 
people for a full day of discussion and goal-setting. The hours that volunteers 
contributed that day alone are equivalent to 2 full time employees for the city of Flint 
working all year long. Citizen engagement is a force multiplier. 

Our efforts going forward, from crime fighting to blight elimination, youth development 
and governance improvements, are all going to take more and more volunteers and 
community leaders. The actions of a few individuals can have a strong impact on 
addressing the issues we face as a city, but that impact is multiplied when more 
residents and community leaders take an active role and get involved. 


8 



Instead of working against each other, we are using more and more of our energy to 
collaborate. As you will hear with law enforcement partnerships and the new water 
pipeline, collaboration is a force multiplier too. 

Flint, smaller yet stronger and smarter. 

What a difference a smart plan can make! Especially when it is backed up by 
community volunteers, and partners who are collaborating and investing. 

Since the master plan was adopted in October, there have been a number of positive 
announcements around collaboration as well as new development initiatives that are in 
alignment with the plan for a sustainable — in the sense of economic, social and 
environmental — Flint. 

Let’s start with General Motors and the spectacular ground-breaking this morning. 

GM will invest $600 million for construction of a new paint shop for the assembly plant. 
This is the largest private investment made in the City of Flint in nearly a decade. The 
facility will be the third new paint facility in North America to use an environmentally 
friendly wet-coat paint process. The New addition will be a 596,000 ft 2 building that in 
total represents approximately 1 million construction work hours. The completion target 
is in 2016. 

I want to recognize... [GM Representatives] 

Now there are currently 2,800 hourly and 250 salaried employees at Flint Assembly. 
The workers are represented by UAW Local 598. 

I want to recognize UAW Region 1-C and our Locals... Including

When the paint shop is finished, GM will have invested more than $1 .5 billion in its Flint 
operations since early 2009. This is an incredible testament to the working men and 
women of the UAW, GM’s leadership, and the community of Flint. 

Flint Engine has received more than $700 million, including $215 million announced last 
year to upgrade the plant for a new small gas engine and an engine for GM’s midsize 
pickups including the Colorado and the Canyon. Flint Assembly also received $328 
million to retool the plant for production of the next generation full-size pickup. 

In Flint, we have been known for vehicle manufacturing and innovation for more than a 
hundred years. It is great to see General Motors also stepping up to preserve the 
carriage and early auto industry heritage with their acquisition of Flint Carriage Factory 
One. This is another investment along the University Avenue corridor that is bringing in 
new energy and will attract people to our community. 

These latest investments by General Motors are proof that Flint will continue to be a 
hub in the auto industry. 1 am pleased to be working with my colleagues, Mayor 
Duggan, Mayor Bernero, and others, along with Michigan State, the University of 
Michigan and Wayne State University for Michigan’s Manufacturing Triangle to be 
recognized by President Obama as a Manufacturing Community region. We are proud 
of our heritage and our future in this growing global industry sector — and we want to the 
world to know! 

We already have the honor of being chosen by the White House as one of the Strong 
Cities, Strong Communities or SC2 sites for this year. President Obama’s Secretary for 
Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan has recognized Flint’s new plan and 
sees the SC2 support as a way to assist with implementing the plan, especially around 
reducing crime, eliminating blight and redeveloping brownfield properties. These are all 
priorities that will position Flint to be more competitive economically. It is wonderful that 
our work is being recognized on Pennsylvania Avenue in our Nation’s Capital and we 
look forward to the project leader being placed in Flint in the near future.

Our comprehensive master plan also commits us to further diversifying our economy. 
Chapter 9, Economic Development and Education, Objective 8. 

There is no better example of our growth and diversification than the expansion of the 
education and medical sectors in Flint. I can’t tell you how proud I am, as a Flinstone 
and Spartan myself, to see the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine 
establishing a campus in downtown Flint as part of the new Health and Wellness 
District. 

Let’s recognize the leaders and doctors who are here representing MSU 
Their energy and talents are already making Flint smarter for sure. 

The CS Mott Foundation and Uptown Reinvestment nonprofit corporation have 
supported this work in all ways imaginable. I want to recognize Ridgway White, the Vice 
President of Special Projects at the C.S. Mott Foundation. 

The Health and Wellness district bring together our medical and education assets and 
focuses them in the core of our community. The District already has investment 
commitments of over $60 million over more than 4 city blocks. Over $30 million is 
committed for bricks and mortar construction. The District is backed by an additional 
$30 M in programming provided by the C.S. Mott Foundation, MSU and our three 
medical institutions: Hurley, McLaren and Genesys. 

It is anchored by Exploration Park, the MSU Masters of Public Health and College of 
Human Medicine, the expansion and relocation of the Flint Farmers Market and 
Genesys facilities. The District is creating over 150 new high paying jobs at MSU and 
Genesys in addition, plus there will be numerous entrepreneurial opportunities at the 
market and commercial kitchen. The primary goal of the District is to provide an 
opportunity for various health and medical related businesses to co locate downtown. 


11 



The first new component to opens its doors was the Genesys Health Clinic on Saginaw 
Street, which is the west end of the district. And now Genesys is adding a PACE senior 
center on the east end of the district across from UM-Flint Residence Hall. 

Representing Flint’s medical sector is a delegation from Genesys led by CEO Betsy 
Aderholt. Please rise and be recognized... 

We are a lot more than a car town, a college town or medical hub, we are growing a 
diverse and sustainable economy for the 21 st Century. We also continue to honor those 
who brought us to this place and the arts and culture that have become so important to 
our community. I asked Lavarne Ross, one of Flint’s finest artists and painters to join us 
here today. He has an amazing exhibit at the Flint Insitute of Arts that you have to see. 
The special exhibit, Lavarne Ross: Works on Paper features 19 works of art including 
pencil, chalk, acrylic and watercolor. You will see the Flint’s electric trolleys, the Kresge 
store downtown, the Buick, an wonderful images of Flint’s families. He is ensuring that 
we continue to honor our heritage which has brought us to where we are today. Arts 
and Culture is an important part of our plan going forward. 

So when you add up all of the investment commitments this past year in Flint’s private 
sector, public infrastructure, key initiatives, and redevelopment projects, the total is 
nearly one billion dollars. Flint, smaller yet stronger and smarter — attracting attention, 
energy and resources. This is what happens when you have a great plan, a team effort, 
and a united and engaged community. 

We continue to need all of your involvement as we work to implement the master plan 
for a sustainable Flint. In fact, the next steering committee meeting is open to the public 
and takes place tomorrow night, Tuesday March 4 starting at 5:30pm at the Flint Public 
Library. Moreover, the Steering Committee has approved a set of Implementation Task 
Groups for each chapter or area of the master plan. T oday I am announcing that the 
application process to be on one of the task groups is open to the public and available 
here this afternoon. It is on the list of Top Ways to Implement the Master Plan — a new 


12 



list that you will receive as you leave today. We are looking for people who will 
champion the plan, work to see it implemented, and have a passion for this place and 
our community. ! know all of you here fit the bill and I encourage you to apply. 
Remember, volunteers are force multipliers. We need you!

111. Action Plan: Implementing the Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint 


We need you to prove that this plan is not going to sit on a shelf. We have a 
responsibility to see the master plan for a sustainable Flint implemented. Under state 
law, the master plan is supposed to be updated every 5 years — NOT every 50! So the 
way I see it, we have 5 years to implement the short term action items, get started on 
the medium and long term work, and then actually update and amend the plan in 2018. 
We need to approach the implementation process like a 5 Year Action Plan — 
starting this year! I am calling for 2014 to be a Year of Service and Action.. .As the 
first step in a five year process to realize our vision and improve all parts of our 
community. 

Yes we need to identify new financial resources, but more than that, we need more and 
more people and partners in our community to step up and do their part to implement 
the plan. This is why you saw the resource tables set up in the lobby, so that after this 
you can sign up to help in all kinds of different and important ways. This is what I really 
want to talk about this afternoon. A 5 Year Action Plan and 2014 as a Year of Service 
and Action. 


The plan is over 250 double sized pages so 1 don’t have time to read all of it here. I am 
going to focus on the aspects related to the 5 community priorities that were established 
right at the beginning of the engagement process with the first round of meetings, 
surveys and workshops. The areas are: 

a) increasing safety 

b) creating jobs 

c) addressing blight 

d) improving infrastructure, and 

e) reforming governance 

Let's go through our goals and answer the questions: What did we do last year and 
what are we going to do this year to make progress on each of these priority areas? 


14 




A. Increase Safety 

a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Chiefs Tolbert and Cox, MSP and Partners 

Our goal with safety is simple: We see Flint providing a secure and healthy environment 
for residents, businesses, students and visitors. 

We have 8 objectives in the master plan that range from developing a state-of-the-art 
efficient and proactive police department to empowering residents to contribute to the 
safety of their neighborhoods. 

The Flint Police and Fire Departments made great strides in 2013 with their 
organizational development and also results: crime and arson rates were down by 
double digits in 2013 compared with the year before, and the trend is continuing into 
2014. 

I want to recognize Flint Police Chief James Tolbert and Flint Fire Chief David Cox for 
their extraordinary service to our community. Chiefs! 

In addition to Flint leadership, another main reason why Flint is a safer community today 
compared with this time last year is the continued dedication of our county, state and 
federal law enforcement partners who are working with us to get offenders off of our 
streets everyday. The US Attorneys Zero Tolerance gun crime prosecutions has 
removed many of the most dangerous individuals who continue to break our laws from 
our neighborhoods. 

The Michigan State Police are there with us everyday. The Michigan State Police are 
assisting with everything from major case detective investigation to traffic enforcement 
and response. This means that Flint Police officers are more available to respond to 91 1 
calls and to community issues. 


15 



[ want to recognize Col. Kristi Etu, commander of the Michigan State Police, who is with 
us here today, Col.! We deeply appreciate your efforts here in Flint. We also have with 
us Lt. Col. Thomas Sands, thank you sir. 

I also want to recognize Harvey Hollins, The Director of the Governor’s Office of Urban 
and Metropolitan Initiatives, and Brian Larkin, the Flint liaison for the office. 

The State of Michigan, with Governor Snyder's leadership, has also invested in Flint by 
funding the City Lockup. I can state as a fact that the city lock up has been an effective 
crime fighting strategy. It has also been a regional crime fighting tool as it is available for 
use by all policing agencies in Genesee County with the Sheriff’s administration. In total 
949 felons and 1576 misdemeanors were processed by the lockup in 2013. The 
Governor has proposed that the funding continue going forward and we urge the State 
Legislature to support this critical investment that is in alignment with our plan to reduce 
crime. 

There are always competing needs when it comes to a budget and funding, but I believe 
that the data from Flint shows that these dollars are providing a high return on 
investment. As State revenues continue to come in above projections, I suggest public 
safety be a top priority. The sad fact is that the State of Michigan, with all of its local 
units combined, have approximately 2,000 fewer police officers than we had 10 years 
ago. Now that State revenues are back to pre-recession levels there needs to be a 
major investment in public safety — so that everything else we aim to do with education, 
economic development, and neighborhood stabilization has the foundation of safe 
community to build upon. 

I urge the Governor and State Legislature to fully fund local revenue sharing and invest 
in initiatives in the Governor’s Secure Cities proposal before lowering tax rates, lt is not 
fair to make local communities pay the price of the recession and then divert our 
recovery. 


16 



1 also call on Flint's voters to support the statewide referendum in August for the State 
to provide a 100% replacement for tax revenues that will be changed with the reform of 
the business equipment, or personal property, tax. 

You see how public safety, being 80% of Flint’s General Fund budget, is as much 
determined by budget and legislative priorities as it is by the community's needs. 

Thankfully, Flint’s citizens are not waiting on the Capitol to tackle crime in their 
neighborhoods alongside of law enforcement. Chief Tolbert has made it a high priority 
to strengthen relationships with community groups. In the master plan, this is the 
second objective on public safety, and second only to eliminating blight which I will 
speak to later. 

Working with community groups and concerned citizens is how we are going to reduce 
crime in Flint. The Flint Police department has a new commitment to placing each 
neighborhood and block club meeting on the patrol calendar so that Command Officers 
know to attend. 

The Flint Police Department is also operating in a more transparent fashion and 
providing information on a daily basis to the public about major crimes. This is posted 
every day on the City of Flint’s website. In the future, a new interactive online tool will be 
in place for citizens and community groups to input specific geographic parameters and 
receive crime updates 3 times a day. New Flint Police facebook and twitter accounts will 
be started this month. 

We need to share more information and also connect more with the community. With 
Blue Badge and the Flint Neighborhoods United, a new training will be offered for crime 
watches to patrol as eyes and ears and rapidly report any criminal behavior. FPD has 
radios we are in the process of narrow banding to use in this effort. We have submitted 
an application for a grant to cover this initiative with the expectation of starting the 
advanced community watches this spring. 


17 



We have an expanded effort with CrimeStoppers through the CrimeStoppers of 
Michigan. You can call 1-800-SPEAKUP with tips to help solve crimes with a guarantee 
of it being 1 00% anonymous. Flint Crime stoppers did an outstanding Job yet we 
needed the expanded resources that CrimeStoppers of Michigan could bring to the 
table. Crime Stoppers of Michigan has been in Flint/Genesee Co. for exactly one month, 
we have received 30 tips in Genesee County, 29-Flint, 1 -Fenton. Tips have been 
submitted for rewards. 

It is part of the new mission of the Flint Police Department to act in partnership with our 
community to protect life and property by striving to prevent crime and preserve peace, 
order and safety. 

Partnerships. Community. Protection. Crime Prevention. Peace. This sounds like a 21 st 
Century police department. 

Now we all need to step up. Volunteer with Blue Badge. Contribute to the new Flint 
Police Foundation. Get involved with Lifelines. Call tips into CrimeStoppers. Check the 
online crime stats. Check on your neighbor. This is how we are going to get Flint off the 
top 10 worst per capita crime list this year!

B. Create Jobs 

a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Planning & Development Dept, and Metro Youth Build 

Of course we also need to create jobs. Our goal for creating jobs is ambitious. We aim 
to have a growing and diverse economy that spurs innovation and small business 
development along with an education system that prepares our workforce, Flint’s 
residents for jobs paving a livable wage . 

We link economic development and education because we believe that human 
development is economic development. We know where we need to start. Community 
schools and community education is objective one, strategy one. All of us who grew up 
here in Flint know that community schools work for youth, for families, for communities 
and for employers. Community education must be there in the fall of 2014 when the 
doors of the Flint Community Schools open for our students. 

The City of Flint is requesting proposals from community partners who will work with the 
Flint Community Schools using federal Community Development Block Grants to 
provide community education services. Superintendent Larry Watkins is a product of the 
community education system — and a graduate of Flint Central High School 1 should 
add — and he recognizes that this is fundamental. I urge other partners to pledge 
themselves to this work as well. We must work together to get this done. Community 
schools is objective one, strategy one for a growing and diverse economy. 

Objective two is to increase the basic skills of our youth and workforce. One of the 
major successes is the Youth Build program that has moved into the City’s Oak 
Business Center. Metro Community Development initiated this in Flint and is one of the 
leading programs across the country. Today a new group of Youth Build participants 
started and they are going to help us meet our objective here. 


19 



I want to recognize Metro’s director Ravi Yalamanchi and program manager Mark 
Evans. Thank you for believing in our youth and working with us to make this program a 
success. 

The City is stepping up to do our part. A new unified Department of Planning and 
Development has been established to lead our public economic development efforts, 
make Flint more business friendly, and ensure equitable redevelopment across all of 
Flint. I want to recognize the inaugural head of the new Department of Planning and 
Development, Megan Hunter who also serves as our Chief Planning Officer and was the 
primary architect of our adopted master plan. Please join me in showing appreciation for 
Ms. Hunter’s amazing work. We want to encourage her in this ground-breaking 
endeavor. 

I also want to recognize the Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce and the Michigan 
Economic Development Corporation. We meet every Friday morning in my office to go 
over every job creation and investment prospect for Flint. Over the past 4+ years this 
has resulted in more than 4905 created and retained jobs along with $1 .5 billion in 
capital investments through 2013. Our total capital investment will be over $2 billion 
after this year. Our performance this past year with job growth and retention is that we 
achieved 60% more than the previous year so we are on a strong upward swing. 

Our latest success is with bringing the American Pipe company to the former Buick site. 

I look forward to people going to work again where there used to be empty concrete 
slabs. When you see Flint & Genesee in the light of cooperation, innovation, and 
opportunity, you will believe that we can do this as part of our 5 Year Action Plan. 

This year we have a lot to do to create jobs. Its time for a Promise Zone for Flint. Our 
state legislators are stepping up on this one. ts time to update all of Flint’s business 
ordinances so we are truly business friendly and redevelopment ready. The City 
Council, Clerk and City Attorney are working to get this done in the next 60 days. This is 
the commitment I made in my first act in office when I hung on open for business sign 


20 



on the front doors of City Hall. We will have a pfan. We will have a process. We will 
have partners. And we will turn this economy around and create job opportunities right 
here in Flint! A strong and smart economy, now that’s SUSTAINABILITY. 

And for those who are looking for work, consider this since I am talking a lot today about 
volunteering. A recent study by the Federal Corporation for National and Community 
Service Office of Research & Evaluation found that active volunteers have a 27% higher 
odds of finding a job afater being out of work than non-volunteers. Volunteers without a 
high school diploma have a 51% higher odds of finding employment. This research 
shows that volunteering increases a person's social network and skill sets and this 
helps to level the playing field for the unemployed when they apply for jobs. 

Volunteering is an employment multiplier.

C. Address Blight 

A Declare War on Blight 

b. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

c. Recognize Cities of Service & Chief Service Officer 

Action Area 3. Address Blight. Blight is a clear and present danger to our future. It 
affects our safety, our neighborhoods, our businesses, our youth. The abandoned 
buildings surrounding us offer shelter for crime and drugs. Scrapped out buildings in our 
neighborhoods endanger our children when they walk to school. We no longer can dwell 
in the dangerous remains of the past. This is not a new problem in Flint but the scale of 
the challenge has pushed up the threat level and it is time for an all-out battle against 
blight! 

It is us versus abandonment, us versus scrapping, us versus illegal dumping, and those 
of us who care versus those among us who have given up. 

St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “If the Trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will 
get ready for battle?” 

Today I blow the trumpet against blight. 

Today Flint declares a war on blight. 

I am asking you today to enlist in the army that will defeat blight in Flint over the next 5 
years. Are you with me? 

There are over 20,000 homeowners living in their homes in Flint. This is a great asset to 
build from that a lot of people don't realize we still have. 

Last year with Cities of Service alone, we had 593 volunteers who were on the front 
lines. The Cities of Service volunteers accomplished much: 



24 Blocks revitalized 

1 ,804,273 pounds of yard waste removed 
1 5 trees planted 

57 new green spaces or gardens created 

25 homes boarded 

4,500 sqft of graffiti removed 

122 previously blighted properties cleaned and maintained 


This was a strong start in our campaign to beat blight in Flint over the next 5 years. 
There were 670 demolitions total in 2013, between the City and the Land Bank. This 
year we are going to demolish approximately more than double that, approximately 
2000 structures. And we are ready for more volunteers in the army for all branches of 
the service: Cities of Service, Keep Genesee County Beautiful Park Tenders and Tree 
Tenders, Flint Neighborhoods United, and all of the groups that are already in this fight 
all across the city. 

The demolitions are funded by the Federal government through the State. The 
champion for us in Washington, DC has been our new Congressman Dan Kildee. It is 
unprecedented for a first year congressman to achieve these results and his success is 
a great testament to his trust with the President’s administration and leaders here in the 
State. Congressman Dan Kildee, thank you for your willingness to keep fighting for Flint! 
We need you to lead us in this war. 

Because the battles in front of us are tough. After this year’s work we estimate that we 
will have approximately 5,500 residential structures and 400 commercial buildings still in 
need of demolition at a total cost of $70 million. 

Total blight elimination means cleaning up vacant properties, creating new green 
spaces, and beautifying our neighborhoods. Regular mowing on all of the 12,000 plus 
vacant lots in Flint calculate to 100,000 cuts. Last year our community groups made an 
incredible start with over 10,000 cuts. We must aim to double our effort every year to 
win this front of the blight battle. The Cities of Service grant is supporting the 


23 



Community Tool Shed at Salem Housing where mowers and equipment can be 
borrowed free of charge. 

I also am proud to announce that we have an additional new field captain, a Chief 
Service Officer for the City of Flint through the Cities of Service initiative and an 
executive on loan program with the Boys and Girls Club and the National Service 
Accelerator funded by the CS Mott Foundation. This is at no cost to the City’s 
taxpayers. Smaller but stronger and smarter. Using volunteers, collaborating and 
investing. 

Mary ZumBrunnen’s first official day is tomorrow. She comes to this position from 
having been working on the service accelerator with national service members, 
AmeriCorps, VISTA, Senior Corps and other service efforts that have connected over 
650 national service members and over 2,000 volunteers with efforts meeting the needs 
of our community. And I am pleased that she is joining the City of Flint — at no cost to 
the City! Please welcome Mary ZumBrunnen. 

There is a role for everyone in the army advancing against blight. Neighborhood 
revitalization is everyone’s responsibility, yet we know that the City has to provide the 
leadership and the tools for you to be effective. I am proud to announce the second 
annual LOVE YOUR CITY month this May to give the entire city a spring cleaning. We 
have to have a strong spring campaign once the snow melts so we don’t lose any 
ground. 

In partnership with Cities of Service and Republic Services, we have three unlimited 
curbside pickup weeks. 

- Unlimited large items: May 5-9 

- Unlimited bagged litter: May 12-26 

- Unlimited bundled branches/lawn debris: May 19-23 


24 



We need to wear these unlimited pickups out! When I drive down the street on Monday 
May 5 th I want to see unlimited large items on the curbs. On Monday May 1 9 lh , I want to 
see unlimited bundled branches and bagged lawn debris. May is the month to make it 
happen as part of the 2014 Year of Service and Action. Put it on the calendar. These 
are your three weeks of blight battling. Don’t drive up north to go fishing. Don’t head 
down south to see your family. Stay right here in Flint, take out the trash, bag that 
garbage from down the street, clean up the vacant lot on the block, i want to see 
Republic working overtime to keep up with us! 

We are also going to do another tire collection day on May 1 7 th and we need you for 
that too, so don’t plan on that weekend for your family reunion. Getting all those old tires 
out is a dirty job but somebody has to do it! 

Now we all need to enlist and fight. The Cities of Service Love Your Block application 
will be available at the Keep Genesee County Beautiful conference this coming 
Saturday. The Ruth Mott Foundation has been a champion of this work for a number of 
years now. 

There are so many ways to make a difference in the blight battle. 

Take care of the vacant property next to your house - shovel snow, mow the yard, pick 
up trash. Report blight and code violations to the City’s Blight Manager, Raul Garcia 

Help organize a clean up for Love Your City Month. 


Apply for a mini-grant for your neighborhood from the Community Foundation, who is a 
great partner in implementing the master plan. 

This is how we are going to fulfill our vision for healthy neighborhoods all over the City 
over the next 5 years. 


25 



D. Improve Infrastructure 

a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Flint River Allies & Karegnondi Water Authority 

Infrastructure — roads, pipes, trails, water — this is another high priority area for Flint. We 
have set a visionary goal in the chapters on transportation, infrastructure and 
community facilities: 

Flint will enjoy a system of reliable and efficient infrastructure and multi-modal 
transportation tailored to meet local needs, and will have a network of comprehensive 
community facilities provided in a coordinated and collaborative manner. 

We have also come out strong with demonstration projects already underway to show 
that we are going to operate in a new paradigm with public works. 

Thanks to the C.S. Mott Foundation, an engineering study is underway to assess the 
best way to put S. Saginaw Street on a road diet. This means reducing the space on the 
road way for vehicular traffic, slowing cars down, and making the corridor more 
accessible for pedestrians and bicyclists. This also can reduce the amount of roadway 
that we need to maintain. We want our transportation network to be safe for all people 
and all ages and not just be surface road expressways moving commuters in and out of 
the city at high speeds. 

Thanks to the Michigan Municipal League Place Plans initiative, we are also designing a 
rails to trails project called the Grand Traverse Greenway. We had a packed room of 
participants in December at the Word of Life church to identify the principles and 
opportunities that will guide the design process. The weather was terrible but it was a 
fantastic session. This is another example of how valuable community engagement is. 
This work needs to be owned by the community and that means folks have to show up 
and participate and that is what is happening coming out of the Imagine Flint planning 
process. 


26 



These projects are clear signs of progress under the objectives in the T ransportation 
section of the master plan. 

We also make a point in the master plan for a sustainable Flint of leveraging our natural 
resources such as our Lakes and River and location in the Great Lakes basin. There 
are a number of objectives related to the Flint River in the environmental features 
chapter, as well as the infrastructure chapter. For instance, objective 5 in the 
infrastructure chapter reads: “Expand opportunities for blue infrastructure” 

So what does this look like? I know when you drive over the Saginaw Street bridge in 
downtown Flint, today you see the decrepit Hamilton Dam. This is a high risk piece of 
infrastructure, right in the middle of the UM-Flint campus and the last barrier to flooding 
downtown during heavy storms. Now with the comprehensive master plan and the Flint 
River Watershed Coalition we have a solution to works towards that will protect the 
waterway, secure downtown, add value to the UM-Flint campus and create access to 
the river for recreational purposes. 

This is a good example of the difference a good plan, collaboration and an investment 
paradigm can make. 

If the City were operating in a reactionary mode, the City would have spent a million 
dollars to drive in concrete pilings to secure the Hamilton dam structure. We would have 
a new permanent monument to failure and the past in downtown Flint. Instead of this, 
and consistent with the master plan objectives of a healthy river waterway through Flint 
(objective 1 of the environmental plan), the City is committing the million dollars to the 
Flint River Restoration initiative. The funding pledge will be leveraged to generate up to 
an additional $4 Million in grant opportunities to create a series of cascades through 
downtown like many other cities have done successfully. The Flint River Restoration 
initiative is about best-practices, good planning, collaboration with partners. This is the 
new way of doing business in Flint and it is working. 


27 



The Flint River has helped sustain people in this area for eons. I am proud that we are 
becoming better stewards of this precious natural resource. I am thankful to the 
hundreds of volunteers, the Flint River Watershed Coalition, the Friends of the Flint 
River Trail, and all of the people who continue to work with us on preserving our part of 
Pure Michigan through the Flint River Corridor Alliance. This includes the University 
Avenue Corridor with Kettering University and Atwood Stadium. A number of 
representatives of our Flint River and corridor allies are here, please stand and be 
recognized. 

Another way you will be able to experience the Flint River is at a revamped Riverbank 
Park. Grants have been secured that will allow for work to begin soon on Riverbank 
Park to make the park ADA accessible and easier to maintain thanks to support from 
the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Trust Fund, the Ruth Mott Foundation, 
the Downtown Development Authority and other community partners and volunteers. 

Another partnership around water that I have to recognize is the Karegnondi Water 
Authority or KWA. This regional entity has become a catalyst for the communities along 
the 1-69 corridor to come together and help each other. We each have unique assets 
from manufacturing to agriculture, urban environments to rural areas that add up to 
more than the sum of the parts and create new opportunities for economic 
development, trade, and innovation. 

KWA is also our future water supply, straight from Lake Huron to the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant at Stewart and Dort Highway. The bond financing for the new pipeline 
is proceeding and the construction schedule is on time. It will take nearly 3 years to get 
the lake water flowing. 

In between, we will leave the Detroit water system now that we have permission 


28 



from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to use the river as a temporary 
primary water source for the next few years as needed until the KWA pipeline can be 
completed. 

This will provide significant savings to the City on the costs of water supply for future 
years. We have been honest that this may not mean lower bills but we will escape the 
escalating costs of the Detroit system because we will be able to manage the water 
treatment system ourselves. The result will be a better capacity here in Flint to mange 
the costs to residents and other customers going forward. The preliminary results from 
the water rate study affirms these savings relative to the Detroit costs. When finalized, 
the data will be shared with the new City Council Public Works Committee and the 
public. The bottom line is that with the master plan, the coming combined capital 
improvement plan, and local control, Flint will be able to maintain the water system 
better. 

One of the ways we will do this is that beginning this Spring, we will be using treated 
water from the Flint River as our temporary primary water source. In recent months and 
due to the eventual increase in use of our Flint Water Treatment Plan, upgrades have 
been made to meet the standards of continuous operation. Instead of paying a bill to 
Detroit, we are investing in Flint's infrastructure and capacity in an efficient manner. 

The track record at the Flint Water Treatment Plan is excellent For many years, the 
river has been used as the backup system to provide drinking water for Genesee 
County. Because of this function, the Flint Water T reatment Center has conducted 
quarterly water treatment to ensure that river water meets stringent standards. These 
treatments have been done as a test to ensure the plant’s use as a temporary water 
supply should service from DWSD be interrupted. Each time these treatment tests have 
conducted, the water has passed the test. 

So later this Spring we will all be drinking Pure Flint Michigan Natural Mineral Water. 
There is a difference in density of minerals found in river water versus that of a large 


29 



freshwater body like Lake Huron. The new water will be properly treated, lightly 
fluorinated, and will taste slightly different than the water from Lake Huron that came 
through Detroit. Pure Flint Michigan Natural Mineral Water. 

And, once the KWA pipeline is completed, the river will remain as our back-up water 
source should the need arise. See, with a long-term plan in place, then every 
expenditure can meet a current need and contribute to our future resilience. This is a 
landmark project which will assist in the transition to a sustainable Flint. 

We have a number of the leaders on the Flint Water Treatment Plant and KWA here, 
including KWA CEO Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright, all of you please 
stand and be recognized... 


The City’s Department of Public Works, which consists of Utilities, Transportation, 
Sanitation, and Facilities, is working on a number of operational changes too, because 
while being good stewards of the natural environment is important, we know we need to 
save some money around here! 

Recently the City of Flint has successfully implemented and tested an automation 
process at the 3 rd Ave. Pump Station facility. This has historically been a continuously 
manned operation (24/7) costing over a half million a year. We now have full remote 
control of all of the pumping, screening and control operations reducing the cost by over 
$315,000 annually. 

At the Pollution Control Facility, the sewer plant, engineering plans are near complete 
that will eliminate the use of the incinerator. Construction will begin this year and after 
completion should result in another half million savings annually. 

Over the next 5 years, think of what we will accomplish. 

$5 million in savings from these 2 plant changes alone 


30 



We will have control of our own lake water supply with the river backup 

We will have a more natural Flint River with better parks 

Our roads will be safer and easier to maintain and trails will connect the city 

I can’t wait to see it all for myself. This is the Flint we imagine for the 21 st Century. 



E. Reform Governance 


a. Summary of Goal, Objective, Strategies and Projects 

b. Recognize Blue Ribbon 

c. Partnership Approach with State, EM, Mayor and Council 

There is one more priority area that I need to address. It came up in every community 
planning session. Flint’s Governance. We have to make changes. One of the most 
important objectives in the Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint is Objective #9 in the 
Infrastructure and Community Facilities Plan. It was placed here because of its 
importance related to the City’s large financial commitments in utilities, but it applies 
across the board. And I quote: "Operate in an open and financially stable manner, 
including improving citizen access, focusing on measurable results, improving the City’s 
financial position and eliminating accumulated deficits.” 

As much as we need a City of Flint Strategic Plan to guide future budgets, we also need 
to reform how we manage the City in a fundamental way. Previously I have called for 
reducing mayoral appointees and council and restructuring city functions to protect the 
general fund for public safety. This was about shrinking city hall but upon further 
reflection smaller by itself isn’t the solution. 

As I said, the State of the City is that Flint is smaller yet stronger and smarter. This is 
what we need in our governance too. Stronger and smarter. We need new proposals to 
ensure 5 year financial projections and accurate revenue estimates are used, not as a 
matter of choice but as a matter of law — in the charter and in our ordinances. I believe 
we need to protect the professionalism of top City officials in finance and administration 
so that once they are appointed they can do their jobs in the public interest. 

The Blue Ribbon Governance Committee, that myself and Councilman Nolden and 
other community members are participating in, will be making recommendations about 
how we can improve our governance. It is my hope that we will have charter 


32 



amendments on the ballot this year so we can prove that we are prepared to make 
lasting changes for the better. 

There are a number of members of the Blue Ribbon Governance Committee who are 
here. We are meeting about 2 times a month and will soon be organizing broader public 
input as we consider reform proposals. Would all of the members of the governance 
committee please stand and be recognized for your time and commitment. 

It was the Emergency Manager Darnell Earley who came up with the idea of the 
Governance Committee. I applaud his willingness to engage the community, and work 
with Council and me, to get us to transition as soon as possible. We are all more than 
ready to put these challenges to rest and move forward. Mr. Earley has a part to do. I 
have a part to do. Council President Kincaid has a part to do. Every Council person has 
a role. And so do you. 

Here at City Hall we must work together to check off items on the transition 
management plan as quickly as we can in a responsible manner. Strategic Plan. Five 
Year Forecast. 2 year budget. Get involved in this process. It is going to be a busy 3 
months here on the 3 rd Floor. 

I am prepared to lead the City back to home rule. I will need cooperation from the City 
Council and the Community. 

This is about going forward, not falling back. 

And yes, we will have to address a number of difficult financial challenges that are still 
before us. The FY1 5 budget will be challenging and with the current court order on 
health care reimbursements, the changes in personnel levels and services may not be 
over. The reality is that we need cost savings from health care in order to protect 
pensions and keep us on a path to solvency and stability. I call on all parties to work 
together. Collaboration is critical in order for us to be successful. 


33 



And we need citizens involved and informed. The next City Council Finance Committee 
meeting is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday March 12 th starting at 4:45pm. Attend if 
you can and let us know your ideas for our strategy and budget going forward. 

IV. Call to Action for Citizens & Partners 

Our new Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint came out of the Imagine Flint planning 
process. As the text in the plan states: Imagine Flint was, and I quote, “the result of 
thousands of people who dared to imagine a better Flint; who love their City so much, 
they took the time to come together to discuss their ideas, voice their fears and 
concerns, and share their dreams and aspirations. With the knowledge that there is 
much more work to be done and the willingness to do it, the people of Flint have 
imagined a better life that they themselves can help create.” 

This spirit of service and commitment to the common good is one of the distinguishing 
features of our community and indeed our country. We have proudly born our burdens 
as we worked for better solutions, often as volunteers, unpaid yet passionate. Consider 
all of the action steps we have touched on today, and this is only a fraction of the 
whole. I see a surge of service stepping up in Flint, there is an army assembling to work 
for change. This is an exciting time to be here and be part of this transformation. 

President John F. Kennedy may have said it best at his first inauguration in 1961 and 
his words apply to our Flint community as well as to the United States at large: “I do not 
believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other 
generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light 
our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And 
so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can 
do for your country.” 

And so my fellow Flintstones, now that you have heard the State of the City, now that 
you know about the key initiatives, now that you have been updated on the war on 


34 



blight, the fight against crime, our commitment to community schools, to jobs, to 
reforms... 

Do not first ask what your City can do for you 
First ask what you can do for Flint 
What wijl you do for Flint? 

We have a list of top ways to implement the master plan. We have a copy for everyone 
as you leave. Choose one. Get started. Love Your Block. Love Your City. Love Your 
Neighbor as Thyself. This starts with families, friends and neighbors taking care of each 
other. 

There is so much to do and so many ways to do it. 

We will be working with the American Red Cross to be better prepared and protected. 
March is Red Cross month. 

I will lead a Mayors Wellness Challenge this April starting with a community weigh in 
right here in City Hall and then doing activities like healthy cooking demonstrations, 
walks and exercise classes. 

We can all be part of the solution for assisting families truly struggling with their utility 
bills by using the new Flint income tax check off for Water Fund contributions that will go 
to the United Way. 

Information on all of these initiatives and more are featured in the Citizen Action Fair in 
the lobby on the first floor as you leave. 

We need you to help implement the master plan. 


35 



We need you to join the battle against blight. 


V. Conclusion 

Volunteers are force multipliers 
Collaboration is critical 

And all of this makes our investments go further, create more jobs, serve more families 

The end to our valley forge winter is inevitable. The snow will melt. A new season will 
come. The war is declared. The battle is in front of us. We are smaller, yet stronger and 
smarter. And in Flint, we never, ever, ever give up. 

May God bless you 

May God bless Flint 

Thank you

Subject: Flint Water System Update 

After speaking with Andy, Dan, Dennis and John, we have a plan for the next steps in Flint's request to 
participate in the KWA with Genesee County. Here is what we can confirm publicly, although unless it's 
a permitting question, we should have Treasury (Terry or I) answer any inquiries. 

Ed Kurtz will submit a resolution to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to the Treasurer, likely 
today. Once I receive word that we have officially received, we can confirm that we have it and the 
Treasurer will thoroughly review the resolution and perform due diligence before making a decision. 
Under PA 436, the State Treasurer must approve contracts over $50,000 that were not competitively 
bid. 

No date has been set for the Treasurer to complete his review, but, he is fully aware of the tight 
timelines necessary to get approvals for the upcoming construction season, and will conduct his review 
accordingly. 

That is all we can confirm publicly through next week. Just so you are aware, and not for public 
consumption, a call was placed to DWSD to let them know that Ed Kurtz was submitting his request and 
that if they have a final best offer that they should submit it very soon. This may prompt them to go to 
the media, or not, but be prepared if you get a call from that angle. 

We need to develop some talking points for the following week, when Andy makes his determination. I 
will try to put together a draft by the end of the day and send it around for review. If anyone has 
anything they would like me to add, feel free to send it my way. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Flint & DWSD water 


Hi guys - 

Just wanted to loop back and check in re: timing on this issue. Last understanding was that was under close review by 
state treasurer and that soonest decision would be made is end of this week, beginning of next. 

As you're both out this week (©), just want to make sure we have a mechanism in place to coordinate with us in Gov's 
comm office as soon as know timing and plan so we can be ready with messaging and any outreach that may be needed. 
Sounds like this will be contentious one way or the other regardless of the determination so just trying to make sure 
we're prepared as possible. 

Please advise. Thanks!

Dear Dr. McMahan and Kettering Team, 

We are in discussions with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
and the US Environmental Protection Agency about a press conference on this 
Thursday to announce next steps in fixing Flint's water problems. Since it is a 
collaborative announcement we are looking for a community site and thought of 
Kettering as our first option. 

Would you be willing to please work with us on providing an appropriate space

Please let us know given the very short timeline here and needless to say this is

Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State of 
Michigan, City of Flint 





State, city failed to release documents sought in FOIA request 


LANSING — State Representative Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) announced earlier today that 
he is filing suit against the state of Michigan and the city of Flint to force them to release 
public documents he requested last month under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

"It's an absolute shame that I have to file suit to force our government to comply with 
the law," Phelps said. "I was shocked at their response, because prior to receiving the denials, 
officials from both the city and state had told me that not only did documents exist, but they 
would be happy to share them with me." 

On Sept. 4 of this year, Phelps requested that the city and state turn over all documents 
and emails regarding the permit and application process that Flint's emergency manager was 
required to complete before the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality gave the go 
ahead to the city to start using the Flint River as its source of drinking water. Late last month, 
the state and the city both denied Phelps' request, saying that no such documents exist. 

In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also quoted in 
several articles on Mlive.com, making comments about the permit application process for Flint 
to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit's system to the Flint River. 

"I want to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality of the river water 
before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent actions, it almost seems 
they knew a lot more than they are letting on to," Phelps said. "Flint residents deserve better 
than this, they deserve to know the truth about the decisions that were made, and if I have to 
fight this in court to get the truth, so be it."

VERIFIED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT COMPLAINT 

There is no other pending or resolved civil 
action arising out of the transaction or 
occurrence alleged in the Complaint against 
Defendant. 


Keith D. Flynn 

Plaintiff Phil Phelps, (“Plaintiff’), by and through his attorneys, Miller Cohen, 
P.L.C., for his Freedom of Infonnation Act Complaint, states as follows: 

Since Spring 2014, families in the City of Flint have been exposed to a significant threat to 
their health and well-being caused by the decision to switch the City’s water supply from Lake 
Huron water to Flint River water. This decision was made by the State’s appointed Emergency 


I Manager in the name of saving money. In the process, the health and welfare of Flint residents has 
been carelessly jeopardized with thousands of residents being exposed to contaminants, including 
E.coli, disinfectant byproduct, and, most recently, lead.

This threat is the very reason why the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 
(DEQ) exists — to protect the public by insisting upon compliance with federal and state 
enviromnental regulations. The DEQ is supposed to work with suppliers of water, such as the City 
| of Flint, and approve or reject applications for permits to alter existing water systems, including 
changes that are made to the source of water. MCL § 325.1004(6). Part of this process requires 
localities to provide the DEQ with detailed technical information evaluating any impact that 
proposed alterations might have on the quality of water provided to the public. Id. 

State Representative Phil Phelps issued information requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the Michigan 
Department of Treasury, and the City of Flint. Representative Phelps wants to see if the State and 
City knew in advance about the potential hazards now faced by Flint residents. He wants to see 

what had been done to avoid this disaster. He requests documents concerning evaluations of the 

j 

quality of water in the Flint River, documents specifically pertaining to the application and permit 
process, and other documents relating to the change in the City’s water source. 

In public statements. State and City officials have discussed documents addressing the 
j! change from Detroit to Flint River water as Flint’s primary source of water. However, in response 
to Representative Phelps’ FOIA requests, they now deny that such documents exist. The 
cleanliness of the water is a critical health and safety issue, which must be revealed to the public. 
The Defendants cannot make public assurances of the existence of documents, only to refuse to 
turn those documents over. 

As a result, Representative Phelps is now forced to file this action, along with another action 
in the Michigan Court of Claims, seeking to disclose information that the public has the right to 
know. For those reasons, Plaintiff Phelps seeks an Order from this Court requiring the City to 
li respond to Plaintiffs FOIA requests and seeking costs and attorney fees for having to file this action.

THE DECISION TO SWITCH FROM DWSD WATER TO FLINT RIVER WATER 

1 2. Prior to switching from DWSD to Flint River water, the City of Flint, in conjunction 
with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of 

1 1 Treasury engaged in a process to evaluate the potential of using the Flint River as Flint’s primary 

; 

source of water. {Exhibit A, 91-95) 

]i j 

13. Gerald Ambrose, the financial advisor to the emergency manager for the City of j 

j 

Flint at the time, testified that: “There was brief evaluation of whether the City would be better off 
to simply use the Flint River as its primary source of water over the long term. That was 
detennined not to be feasible.” (Id. at 91) 

14. Mr. Ambrose went on to testify that the determination that it was not feasible was 

j! 

made by “the emergency management team based on conversations with the MDEQ that indicated 
they would not be supportive of the use of the Flint River on a long-temi basis as a primary source 
| of water.” (Id.) 

i 

15. Mr. Ambrose also testified in regards to an independent study that was conducted 
by the State Department of Treasury as to the feasibility of changing the source of water to the 
Flint River. (Id. at 93-94) 

1 6. Notwithstanding this evaluation, the City of Flint decided to move forward with 
| changing the source of its drinking w'ater to the Flint River until the KWA pipeline was finished. 

17. In order to do so, however, the City of Flint was required by the Safe Drinking 
Water Act to apply for a permit to change the source of water: 



J X „ 

On 

«! i S 


(6) Before commencing the construction of a waterworks system or an alteration, 
addition, or improvement to a system, a supplier of water shall submit the plans and 
specifications for the improvements to the department and secure from the department 
a permit for construction as provided by rule. Plans and specifications submitted to the 
department shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed under article 20 of the 
occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.2001 to 339.2014. A contractor, builder, 
or supplier of water shall not engage in or begin the construction of a waterworks 
system or an alteration, addition, or improvement to a waterworks system until a valid 
permit for the construction has been secured from the department. A contractor, builder, 
or supplier of water who permits or allows construction to proceed without a valid 
permit, or in a manner not in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by 
the department, violates this act. A supplier of water shall not issue a voucher or check 
or in any other way expend money or provide consideration for construction of a 
waterworks system unless a valid permit issued by the department is in effect. The j 
department may issue a permit with conditions to correct minor design deficiencies. If 
eligible, a supplier may request an expedited review of an application for a permit under 
| section 4a. 

MCL § 325.1004(6). 

18. The Safe Drinking Water Act provides that the DEQ administers the Act and 
promulgates administrative rules to enforce its requirements. One of those administrative rules 
defines “alteration” to include “modification of, or addition to, an existing waterworks system, or 
portion of the system, that affects ... the source . . . .” Admin. Rule 325.101 02. 

19. On the DEQ’s website, the DEQ provides the application discussed above. 

j | 

! (Exhibit B) 

20. The application requires the submission of highly technical plans and analysis for 
the alteration of the Water System. (Id.) 

21. Failure of a “supplier of water” — which include municipalities — to apply and 
receive a permit prior to alteration of a Water System violates the Act punishable by a fine of not 

I | 

l\ i 

i more than $5,000.00 for each day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or 
both. MCL § 325.1021. 

22. Prior to switching to the Flint River, it was reported that the City was in the process 
of applying for such a permit. (Exhibit Q

23. On March 28, 2014, it was reported that the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality halted the City’s attempt to move forward with the switch in water source 
without receiving the permit. (Id.) Steve Busch, the Lansing and Jackson district supervisor for 
the DEQ, noted that the DEQ had only received “preliminary design plans and preliminary 

j specifications” that the agency had commented on. (Id.) 

24. Howard Croft, Flint’s Director of Public Works, denied the inadequacy of the plans 

\\ 

j 

! provided noting that the City had provided “A fully engineered constniction package, including 
all the work to be performed.” (Id.) He went on to note that, “The submittal package has been 
ji under review for more than 30 days. The city has had ongoing discussions with the DEQ regarding 
the process and we anticipate a favorable response soon.” (Id.) 

25. On April 5, 2014, Emergency Manager Earley stated that the final application for 
the permit was filed with the DEQ noting that “We expect to have the pennit early next week.” 
{Exhibit D ) 

26. Sure enough, the very next week, the spokesman for the Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ), Brad Wurfel, was reported on April 10, 2014 as saying that the 

j DEQ issued “a series of construction pennits” noting that “They are racing to get all this work 
done.” {Exhibit E) 

27. The switch to Flint River water took place on April 25, 2014. {Exhibit F)

28. Since switching to Flint River water, Flint residents have been placed in jeopardy 
being exposed to substantial threats to their health and safety due to contaminants found in their 
drinking water. 

29. On August 14, 2014, the water tested positive for fecal coliform bacteria, E.eoli, 
leading the City to issue a boil water advisory. (. Exhibit G ) 

30. The water once again tested positive on August 19, 2014 with boil water advisories 
extending into late September 2014. {Exhibit H) 

31. On January 2, 2015, a new threat to public health and safety was identified. In an 
effort to eliminate the bacteria, the City increased the chlorine used in the System. Residents began 
complaining that the water was causing skin rashes and their hair falling out. ( Exhibit /) 

32. Then, on January 2, 2015, the City of Flint officially announced that the level of 
trihalomethanes (TTHMs) — a byproduct of disinfectant — was higher than the allowable amount 
provided for in federal law forcing the City to provide notice to residents. {Exhibit J) 

33. Long tenn exposure to TTHMs can create liver, kidney, or central nervous system 

j! I 

| problems, and may increase the risk of cancer, especially amongst those who have severely 

! compromised immune systems such as infants or the elderly. (Id.) 

jj | 

34. Over nine months later, the City was finally able to reduce TTHM levels to the 

federal limit. {Exhibit K) 

35. Most recently, in July 2015, Virginia Tech University researchers released the 
results of their own independent study of Flint’s water supply revealing incredibly high amounts 
of lead far exceeding the allowable limitations of lead content under federal law. {Exhibit L ) 




36. On September 2, 201 5, the researchers at Virginia Tech released another study that 
compared the DWSD water to the Flint River water {Exhibit. L) That study concluded that the 
natural corrosive properties of Flint River water is leaching lead from the City’s aging 
infrastructure. {Exhibit L ) 

37. On September 24, 2015, the results of a subsequent study by Dr. Mona Hanna- 
Attisha, program director for the pediatric residency at the Hurley Children’s Hospital at Hurley 
Medical Center in Flint were released finding an elevated level of lead in the blood samples of 

: Flint children. {Exhibit M) Specifically, the study showed that the number of children in the City 

| j 

with elevated blood levels nearly doubled after the city started using the river. (Id.) 

38. According to Dr. Hanna- Attisha: “What we found in our data is concerning.” (Id.) 

Dr. Hanna-Attisha noted that “This is not something you mess around with.” (Id.) 

REPRESENTATIVE PHELPS SEEKS DOCUMENTS RELATING TO 
CHANGING THE CITY’S SOURCE OF WATER TO 

THE FLINT RIVER AND THE CITY AND STATE FAILED TO COMPLY 

| 

39. In response to this health crisis, Representative Phelps requested the following 
records from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of 
Treasury, and the City of Flint pursuant to FOIA on September 4, 2015: 

1. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality], or its agents, has in its possession, 
including correspondence, related to any waivers, permits or applications to use the 
Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the City of Flint or any 
other municipality or municipal entity. 

2. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality], or its agents, has in its possession, 
including correspondence, related to any communications between the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality, or its agents, and/or the Michigan 
Department of Treasury, or its agents, regarding any waivers, permits or 
applications to use the Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for 
the City of Flint or any other municipality or municipal entity. 



3. All documents the [City of Flint/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality] has in its possess, including 
correspondence, related to any communications between the [City of Flint of 
Treasury/Michigan Department of Treasury/Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality], or its agents, and the Office of the Governor of the State 
of Michigan, or its agents, regarding any waivers, permits or applications to use the 
Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the City of Flint or any 
other municipality or municipal entity.

40. On September 4 th , Representative Phelps had a face-to-face conversation with 
Howard Croft, Flint’s Director of Public Works, at the Flint City Hall beginning shortly after 
3:00pm and ending around 4:20pm. Representative Sheldon Neeley was also present during the 

j 

meeting. 

41 . Both Representative Phelps and Neeley asked several questions regarding the 
switch to Flint River water, the pennits and applications surrounding the switch, potential hold 
ups/delays in the switch due to DEQ’s approval process, and correspondence between the City of 

1 

Flint and the DEQ regarding all of the previous items. 

42. Howard Croft said that they did in fact have documents related to those topics and 
stated that it would be no problem to share them with both Representatives. 

43. On September 14, 2015, the City of Flint changed its story. In the City of Flint’s 
formal response to Representative Phelps’ FOIA requests dated September 1 4, 20 1 5, the City has 


refused to provide those documents. {Exhibit O) 

44. Contradicting Mr. Croft’s earlier assertions as well as statements made to the press 


in 2014, the City of Flint asserted that no such documents exist: 

The records which you have requested do not exist under the name given by the 
requester or by another name reasonably known to this public body or are not retained 
by this public body in the perfonnance of an official functions. This is a certification 
of their non-existence. No Records — Requested documents do not exist.

45. The DEQ responded on or about September 1 6 th by telephone indicating that it was 
DEQ policy to provide copies of documents to members of the State Legislature free of charge 
and noting that there were several documents that would be sent over to Representative Phelps’ 
office via email, but only if he withdrew his FOIA request. 

46. Representative Phelps indicated that he had to contact his attorney to discuss 

] 

I whether he should withdraw the FOIA requests. Since that day, Representative has not received 

j 

any verbal communication with the DEQ. 

47. On September 28, 2015, after Representative Phelps refused to withdraw his FOIA 
ji request, the DEQ changed its tone like the City of Flint. {Exhibit P ) 

48. Brad Wurfel, the spokesman for the DEQ stated in an interview with Gongwer that 
“Flint did not have to file an application because the City has always listed the Flint River as its 
back-up should it need it for a water supply.” {Exhibit Q) 

49. Obviously, Mr. Wurfel’ s most recent statement ignores the statements that he, and 

! others, made to the media prior to the switch. They all maintained that Flint was required to file 

\\ 

an application for a permit with the DEQ and did in fact file an application that was ultimately 
approved by the DEQ on or about April 10, 2014. 

50. Nonetheless, Mr. Wurfel indicated during that interview that “other documents . . , 
are available — to Mr. Phelps or anyone — dealing with the process the city and state took preparing 
for the switch.” (Id.) To date, Representative Phelps has not received these other documents. 

51. Similarly, the Michigan Department of Treasury denied Representative Phelps’ 
|| FOIA request on the same grounds as the City of Flint and the DEQ on September 29, 2015. 

{Exhibit R ) 


52. To date, Representative Phelps’ has not received the documents that he requested.

53. The public has a right to know the degree to which the State knew about or took 
any action to determine the potential hazards of making this switch, prior to the decision being 
implemented by the State-appointed Emergency Manager. It is for that reason that Representative 


Phil Phelps brings this suit to compel the City of Flint to provide the documents requested pursuant 
to FOIA. 

COUNT I 

VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 

54. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference each of the preceding paragraphs, j 

55. Documents, such as correspondence and communications, relating to any waivers, 
pemiits or applications to use the Flint River as a source for water and/or drinking water for the 
City of Flint or any other municipality or municipal entity constitute public records subject to 
FOIA. 

56. Plaintiff reasonably described the documents that he was seeking. 

57. No exemption recognized under FOIA applies to Representative Phelps’ requests. 

58. The Defendant’s denial is wholly without merit as acknowledged by the 
Defendant’s own agents in the past. Defendant failed to perform a good faith effort to conduct a 

I 

search for the requested records using methods reasonably expected to produce the requested 
; information. 

59. Hence, Defendant violated the FOIA, and for the violation, the Defendant should 
face all fines, costs and fees as pursuant to the FOIA statute, as well as be ordered to immediately 
tender the information. 

60. Due to the Defendant’s refusal to respond to the FOIA requests, the Defendant now 
bears the burden to sustain the reason for its denial. MCL §15.240(4). 



61. MCL § 15.240(5) provides that actions commenced pursuant to FOIA “shall be 
assigned for hearing and trial and for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in 


every way.

WHEREFORE, and for the above-stated reasons. Plaintiff requests that this Honorable 
Court grant the following relief: 

a. Order an expedited hearing as required by MCL § 1 5.240(5); 

b. Order that the Defendant to immediately respond to the FOIA requests of 
Plaintiff as found in the Exhibit N letters; 

c. Find that the Defendant made a final determination to deny the FOIA requests, 
and such determination was in violation of the FOIA and arbitrary and 
capricious. Thus, Order that the Defendant pay to Plaintiff reasonable 
attorney’s fees, costs and disbursements, and order punitive damages of $5.00; 

d. Award all other relief as this Court deems appropriate. 

Respectfully submitted,

talking about, are you referring to the cost of the 
City's participation in the pipeline? 

Q Both . I 

A I had no direct involvement in any discussions relating 
to the actual cost estimates for the construction of the 
pipeline. 1 was, however, involved in doing the analysis 
of the cost benefit to the City of participating in the 
Karegnondi Water Authority as compared to continuing to 
receive, to purchase water from the Detroit Water and 
Sewer System. j 

Q Were any other options — did you look at any other ; 

options apart from those two or variations of those two? 

A There was brief evaluation of whether the City would be 
better off to simply use the Flint River as its primary 

source of water over the long term. That was determined ! 

i 

not to be feasible, • 

Q Who determined that it wasn't feasible? 

A It was a collective decision of the emergency management ! 

team based on conversations with the MDEQ that indicated 
they would not be supportive of the use of the Flint 
River on a long-term basis as a primary source of water. 

G What was the reason that they gave? j 

A you'll have to ask them. • 

{ 

Q Okay. You don't recall? < 

i 

A I do not recall.

How, am I correct in that is actually what is happening 
now, for at least a short-term — 

That's correct. 

— the City of Flint is using its own facilities and 
supplying its own water through the Flint River? 

That is correct. 

When was the possibility of using that as a long-term 
solution abandoned? 

MR. WARREN: Do you mean the Flint River? 

MR. ALEC GIBBS: Yes. 

THE WITNESS: Probably sometime in FY13. I 

don't recall specifically. 

MR- BADE: I'm just going to object to the form 

of the question. Abandoned by whom? 

(BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) By the collective body that was 
responsible for making the ultimate decision by the City 
of Flint, I assume. Sometime in fiscal year 2013? 
Sometime between — I guess sometime probably during '13, 
I believe, or perhaps even midway through '12. 


I don't recall the specific dates. 

But it was based on communications from the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality. 

MR. WARREN: Objection; asked and answered. 

You can answer.

THE WITNESS: It was based on information that 

we received from others within the City who said that 
MDEQ was not supportive of a long-term use of the Flint 
River. 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) Who are the City of Flint sources who 
communicated the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality's position? 

MR. WARREN: Object to lack of foundation. You 

can answer. 

THE WITNESS: I believe it was our utilities 

administrator, our public works director. 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) And who are those individuals? 

A Howard Croft, Daugherty Johnson. 

Q Are you aware of an independent study on the feasibility 
of alternative plans for water supply for the City of 
Flint that was commissioned by the Department of 
Treasury? 

MR. WARREN: I'm going to object to relevance. 

We're getting really far afield here. I'm not directing 
him not to answer, but hopefully this can be tied up very 
quickly and we can all move on. 

Q (BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) I’m just asking if you're aware of 
the study. 

A Tell me what the name of the study is . 

Q I have it here. Mark this as Exhibit 5.

(Exhibit Number 5 was marked.) 

Q {BY MR. ALEC GIBBS) Do you recognize this study? 

A I do not recall seeing this actual document, but I am 

aware of the study. 

Q Okay. Do you remember when this study was commissioned? 

A I don't know. Apparently it was completed in February of 

2013. 

Q The study makes reference to a number of meetings between 
the City of Flint and the Department of Treasury 
concerning the investigation into water supply options 
for the City of Flint. Did you participate in any of 
those meetings? 

A I did. 

Q What meetings do you recall participating in? 

A I recall one or two meetings in Lansing. I don't 
remember when. 

Q Do you remember if one of those meetings took place in 
December of 2012? 

A I do not recall the date. 

Q Do you remember who participated in these meetings? 

A I do not recall. I was in attendance with the emergency 
manager then Michael Brown, as I recall, or Ed Kurtz. I 
honestly do not recall the dates and the timing. 

Q Okay. There is a reference to, if you look to Page 2 of 
the study, it says although it appeared that this was

a — it references an option for the Flint water 
treatment plant to supply the City of Flint without being , 
supplied from either DWSD or KWA was initially 
considered. The preliminary investigation evaluated the ; 
cost associated with the required improvements to the 
plant and the Flint River dam system. And that although 
it appeared that this was a viable option, Flint, in a 
meeting on December 20th f 2012 with the treasury, stated 
that the City did not want to pursue that option and it 
is no longer being considered. 

Do you recall that being discussed in one of ! 
those meetings you referred to earlier? 

A No. But that's consistent with the decision that we 

reached. ;

annual contributions will be over the term of years for 
the loan bond amounts? In other words, what are Flint's ' 
debt service payments relative to the pipeline 
construction going to be on an annual basis? 

A The debt service only?

H. Estimated minimum flows and pressures within 

the proposed water main system (3) gpm at psi 


(1) Every water system must decide what levels of fire fighting flows they wish to provide. Fire flow should be appropriate 
for the area (residential, commercial, industrial) being served by the project. Typical fire flow rates can be obtained 
from the water supply, local fire dept., ISO or AWWA. The water system must then be designed to be able to provide 
the required fire flows while maintaining at least 20 psi in all portions of the distribution system, 

(2) Flows and pressures at the connection points must be given to determine if the existing water main(s) are able to 
deliver water to the new service area. These numbers can be obtained from a properly modeled and calibrated 
distribution system hydraulic analysis or hydrant flow tests performed in the field. If more than one connection is 
proposed, list as needed. 

(3) List what the estimated minimum flows can be expected in the proposed water mains based on estimated water 
demands, head losses, elevation changes and other factors that may affect flows, such as dead end mains.

FLINT, MI - Not so fast, state officials are telling Flint administrators charging toward an April 18 date to 
begin using the Flint River for all of the city's water needs. 

The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality says it hasn't received the proper paperwork from the 
city. When the state does get it, a review of the application for state permission to use the river could take 
30 to 45 days. 

The city is switching over from buying treated water from Detroit to using the Flint River for drinking water 
temporarily. Once the Karegnondi Water Authority completes its pipeline from Lake Fiuron to Genesee 
County, Flint will switch to the KWA. 

"In regards to the actual application, we haven't received one," said Steve Busch, Lansing and Jackson 
district supervisor in the DEQ's office of drinking water and municipal assistance. "We've received 
preliminary design plans and preliminary specifications and we've commented on those. They may be 
waiting until they have ail the comments worked out before they submit the application." 

Flint has bought treated Lake Huron water from Detroit, but that contract was terminated when Flint signed 
on to purchase 18 million gallons of raw water per day from the Karegnondi Water Authority. The contract 
termination goes into effect April 17. 

The under-construction pipeline will bring raw Lake Huron water to Flint and Genesee County when it is 
complete by the end of 2016. 

People in the city will drink Flint River water until the pipeline is complete. The Detroit Water and Sewerage

Department said it would stop selling water to Flint and Genesee County on its current contract on April 
17, 2014. Genesee County is negotiating with Detroit for water until the KWA pipeline is flowing. 

Busch said state reviews generally take between 30 and 45 days, but would not comment on if Flint would 
be ready to transition to river water by the time Detroit terminates the contract with the city. 

"A fully engineered construction package, including ail the work to be performed, has been submitted to the 
DEQ by the city of Flint in preparation for the transition to use of the Flint River as a temporary primary 
water source," said Howard Croft, Flint's director of public works, in a statement. "The submittal package 
has been under review for more than 30 days. The city has had ongoing discussions with the DEQ regarding 
the process and we anticipate a favorable response soon." 

If the state hasn't approved Flint's use of river water by April 18, Busch said, the city would just continue to 
buy water from Detroit on a non-contract price until Flint has state OK to begin using the river. 

"I don't think there is any scenario that we will just willy-nilly cut off service for Flint," said Bill Johnson, a 
consultant and spokesman for Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. "Negotiations are continuing." 

Croft said the DEQ has been reviewing the request and asking questions throughout. 

"When both sides come to an agreement and ail issues have been addressed, then the permit is granted," 
Croft said in the statement. "Flint has been in ongoing communication with Genesee County and the DWSD 
to ensure that there is no interruption of water service to Flint customers. As the Mayor (Dayne Walling) said 
in his State of the City address ’beginning this spring, we will be using treated water from the Flint River as 
our temporary primary water source.’ We are still on target to meet this goal.” 

Croft said there will be a series of public forums where residents can ask questions about the city’s water 
transition, what that will mean for rates and others. He did not have specifics about when and where those 
meetings will take place.

Emergency manager says city could have permit to use Flint 
River water by next week

FLINT, MI — The city expects to have a state permit that will allow it to use the Flint River for drinking water 
by next week. 

Emergency manager Darnell Earley said today, April 4, that the final application for the permit has been filed 
with the state Department of Environmental Quality after months of working with the state to ensure smooth 
sailing for the application. 

"We expect to have the permit early next week,” said Earley. "We are still on track to operate our treatment 
plant this spring." 

The emergency manager's comments come after a story in MLive-The Flint Journal last week indicated 
the DEQ had not received the proper paperwork from the city for permission to use the river. 

DEQ officials said in the story that the application process could take 30-45 days, but Earley challenged the 
idea that it will take that long and said city and state officials have been working closely in advance of 
submitting the final application. 


The city is attempting to switch from buying treated water from the city of Detroit to using the Flint River for 
drinking water temporarily by mid-Aprii. 

Once the Karegnondi Water Authority completes its pipeline to Lake Huron, the city has committed to 
switching back to using water from Lake Huron and the KWA again 

Earley said he expects to transition from Detroit water to Flint River water by April 17, the date Detroit 
officials have set for terminating the existing arrangement between the two cities, 

"We don't think there will be a lag" between those dates, he said. 

Earley said he has a contingency plan if the switch to the Flint River isn't made by April 17. Detroit Water

Flint gets final permit approvals from state to use Flint River for 
drinking water

FLINT, MI — Bottoms up, Flint. 

The state of Michigan has issued the permits needed for the city to begin using the Flint River for drinking water, a 
major step toward ending water purchases from the city of Detroit as early as next week. 

''They've got a series of construction permits" that were issued Wednesday, April 10, said Brad Wurfel, a spokesman 
for the state Department of Environmental Quality. "They areracing to get all this work done." 

The permits have been on Flint's to-do list since the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it was terminating 
its contract to sell water here on April 17. 

That deadline was issued one year ago, and city and state water officials have been working and consulting on 
required upgrades at Flint's water treatment plant since. 

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz said today, April 10, that the city is still targeting April 17 as the day to shut off Lake 
Huron water — treated and pumped here by DWSD -- and to turn on the intakes into the river. 

Because work is still going on inside and outside the city's treatment plant, the exact time and date for the switch 
hasn't been set yet, Lorenz said. 

Earlier this week, Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley called the city's ability to cut out the cost of water 
purchases from Detroit a "monumental change" for the city. 

"The city of Flint will be able to control water costs," Earley said. "I'm kind of glad we're not a part of that discussion 
(about the future of the Detroit water system) anymore." 

A consultant hired by Earley is expected to recommend new water rates during a City Council committee meeting at 
5 p.m. today. The emergency manager has already saidrates will not be reduced because of upgrades that are 
needed in Flint's water distribution system. 

Flint officials will need that infrastructure upgrade whether they use river or lake water. City officials have signed an 
agreement to use Lake Huron water supplied by the Karegnondi Water Authority once the pipeline it is building is 
completed -- something that's expected to happen in 2016.

FLINT, MI - Mayor Dayne Walling asked for a countdown from the group of about a dozen people huddled 
inside a small building on Friday, April 25. 

"Three, two, one," they counted, then Walling pushed a small black button. 

Seconds later, a green light winked out, and that was it. 

Watch the video to see Flint effectively cut its water ties with Detroit when the mayor pushes the button. 

Flint will use the river until the Karegnondi Water Authority builds its pipeline to Genesee County. The $274 
million project is expected to be complete sometime in 2016. 

Friday's event at the Flint water treatment plant also featured Walling and other elected officials 
drinking Flint River water. 

"It tastes like. ..water," said Fourth Ward Councilman Joshua Freeman after drinking a cup. 

It should take about two days for the residual Detroit water to clear the city's water system before all Flint 
customers will be drinking treated river water. 

"Water is an absolute vita! service that most everyone takes for granted," Walling said. "It's a historic 
moment for the city of Flint to return to its roots and use our own river as our drinking water suppiy."

(This story has been updated to correct 
information about water test results in the 
boil water advisory area.) 

FLINT, MI -- A second water sample in an 
area where residents have been told to 
boil their drinking water has tested 
positive for total eoliform, meaning owners 
of businesses and residents there should 
continue to boil water until further notice - 
- at least until Wednesday, Aug. 19.

"We don’t know yet what caused this. We 
don't have a smoking pistol," said 
Mike Prysby, an engineer with the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. 

Update: Flint officials say 'abnormal' test to blame in E. coli scare 

Flint officials have ramped up testing in the boil-water area, a half-mile square area on the city's west side, 
since a positive test for fecal eoliform bacteria on Thursday, Aug. 14. 

Fecal eoliform bacteria -- also known as E.coii — can make people sick, and are a particular concern for 
those with weakened immune systems. 

Prysby called fecal eoliform bacteria in drinking water unusual, something that typically happens fewer than 
a half-dozen times In any given year statewide. Sometimes, doesn't happen anywhere in Michigan over a full 
calendar year, he said. 

The second positive test for total eoliform came from samples taken Saturday, Aug. 16, according to Prysby. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says positive total eoliform tests suggest there may be a pathway

for pathogens and/or fecal contamination to enter the drinking water distribution system. 

For drinking water, total conforms are used to determine the adequacy of water treatment and the integrity 
of the distribution system, according to ERA, 

"The absence of total conforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecal pathogens are 
present," the agency Web site says, "Thus, total coliforms are used to determine the vulnerability of a 
system to fecal contamination." 

Fecal coliform and E. coli are bacteria that 
indicate water may be contaminated with 
human or animal feces. 

Microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms, and may also 
pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely 
compromised immune systems, according to a news release from the city. 

Flint's boil advisory is in an area bordered by Mann Halt Avenue on the north and east, Whitney Avenue on 
the south, and the city limits on the west. 

The contamination is a concern for Sandi Blackmon, owner of Sandi's Elegant Catering on South Ballenger 
Highway, who said she's scrambling to keep up with her work with a boil advisory in effect. 

Not only does the advisory say water for drinking should be boiled, but also water for washing dishes — even 
brushing teeth. 

"I'm concerned, because I'm a former culinary arts student. I know about what food-born bacteria can do ... 
E.coli can be deadly," Blackmon said. 

Representatives of other restaurants in the busy commercial area of Balleneger and Corunna Road said they 
were boiling water Monday and will be until they receive an all-clear message from City Hail. 

"It's inconvenient but we do it — we do the best we can," said David Todorovsky, an owner of Atlas Coney 
Island. 

Flint Councilwoman Vicki VanBuren, who represents the area, has another reason for concern about the boil 
water advisory. 

"My mother iives in that area," VanBuren said. "She has a lot of health concerns (so) I took her over some 
bottled water and told her not to use (tap water) to drink or cook with it. 


This is the area in which a boil water advisory is in effect on the west 
side of the city of Flint.

"This would concern me no matter what part of the city it was in," she said. 

Council members could get more information on the water contamination and what may have caused it at 
committee meetings this week. 

In the meantime, Prysby said there are multiple possible explanations for the contamination, including water 
main breaks in the area, chlorine levels that are off-kilter or a poor sample location or collection technique. 

Prysby said water coming out of Flint's water treatment plant continues to meet all drinking water standards, 
meaning the problem is within the water distribution system. 

"We haven't confirmed a reason," he said of the results, "We're still investigating further. In some situations, 
we never find out why." 

The city is warning the people in the localized area to not drink the water without boiling it first for one 
minute, and letting it cool before using. 

Boiled or bottled water should be used for not just drinking, but for making ice, brushing teeth, washing 
dishes and preparing food.

FLINT, MI — Water in a small area on 

Flint's west side has tested positive again 

for total coliform, and the city's boil water 

advisory there is continuing until at least Wednesday, Aug. 20. 


MLive file photo 


Mike Prysby, district engineer for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, said water in the haif- 
square-mile area tested positive for total coliform on Saturday, Aug. 16, and Sunday, Aug. 17. 


Flint officials have ramped up testing in the boil-water area since a positive test for fecal coliform 
bacteria on Thursday, Aug. 14. 


The boil-water area is Mann Hail Avenue on the north and east, Whitney Avenue on the south, and the city 
limits on the west. 


Fecal coliform bacteria — also known as E.coli — can make people sick, and are a particular concern for 
those with weakened immune systems. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says positive total coliform tests suggest there may be a pathway

"The absence of total conforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecai pathogens are

system to fecai contamination." 

The city of Flintissued a statement Monday, Aug. 18, saying "testing over the last 48 hours has shown no 
signs of E. coii or fecal coliform bacteria in the water," but makes no mention of the total coliform test 
results. 


The city’s statement says a sampling error is believed to be to biame for the initial abnormal test.

Page 2 of 2 


Prysby said the back-to-back positive total coliform tests are a "general indicator there could be 
more pathogenic organisms present" in water but is "not a direct indicator." 

"We haven't narrowed it down to any one possibility (but) we don't play Russian roulette with public health," 
Prysby said of the abnormal samples and the need to continue testing. 

Prysby said test results are "moving in the right direction" because there have been no additional discoveries 
of E. coli or fedcal coliform bacteria in water.

FLINT, MI — The city has issued a boil 
advisory for a portion of Flint, saying water 
in the area has tested positive for total 
coliform bacteria. 

The area of the advisory is bordered by 
Dayton Street on the north, DuPont Street 
on the east, the Flint River on the south, 
and by Lavelle Road to the Flint River on 
the west, the city said in a news released 
issued today. Sept. 5. 

The latest advisory marks the second 
time in less than 30 days that residents 
and businesses in a part of the city have 
been told to boil or use bottled water for 
drinking, bathing, making ice, brushing 
teeth, washing dishes, and preparing food. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
says positive total coliform tests suggest 
there may be a pathway for pathogens 
and fecal contamination to enter a drinking

system to fecal contamination." 

Boiling water kills bacteria or other harmful organisms, according to the city's advisory. 

"Total coliform bacteria are generally not harmful themselves. Conforms are bacteria which are naturally 
present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentiaily-harmfui, bacteria may be 
present," the city’s statement says. 

"Usually, coliforms are a sign that there could be a problem with the treatment or distribution system 
(pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if other bacteria 
of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E. coli, are present. We did not find any of these bacteria in our 
subsequent testing," the statement says. 

The city says it will flush the system in the boil advisory area and increase chlorine added to water. 

All water testing results at the city's Water Treatment Plant have shown Flint's water, which is drawn from 
the Flint River, meets ail Safe Water Drinking Standards when it leaves the facility.

important information About Your Drinking Water 

Tests showed coliform bacteria in the City of Fiint water 

Our water system recently violated a drinking water standard. Although this incident was not an 
emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we did to correct the 
situation. 

We routinely monitor for drinking water contaminants. We took 150 samples to test for the presence of 
colifofm bacteria during September 2014. 15 of those samples (10%) showed the presence of coliform 
bacteria. The standard is that no more than 5 percent of our samples may do so. 

What should 1 do? 

You do not need to boil your water or take other corrective actions. However, if you have specific health 
concerns, consult your doctor. People with severely compromised immune systems, infants, and some 
elderly may be at increased risk. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their 
healthcare providers. General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available 
from ERA’S Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. 

What does this mean? 

This is not an emergency. A portion of the City was notified to boil their water at the time of the incident 
until it was resolved. Coliform bacteria are generafly not harmful themselves. 

Conforms are bacteria which are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that 
other, potentially harmful, bacteria may be present. Conforms were found in more samples than were 
allowed and this was a warning of potential problems. 

Usually, coiiforms are a sign that there could be a problem with the system’s treatment or distribution 
system (pipes). Whenever we detect coliform bacteria in any sample, we do follow-up testing to see if 
other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E. coii, are present. We did not find any of 
these bacteria in our subsequent testing, and further testing shows that this problem has been resolved. 

What happened? What was done? On September 5, 2014, after routine and repeat samples showed 
the presence of total coliform, a boi! water order was issued to the affected area. That area was flushed 
and resampled until samples were non-detect for total coliform. The boil order was lifted on September 9, 
2014. Samples collected since then show that all results met acceptable limits.

FLINT- Some Flint residents are complaining that the city’s water is causing skin problems for some children. 

Hundreds of people turned out Tuesday to discuss Flint’s water quality at a meeting with the mayor and city council members. Flint resident Qiana 
Dawson said her 4-year-old and 2-year-old have broken out in rashes because of the water, resulting in high doctor’s bills. 

“You all need to work with me on money,” she said. 

LeeAnne Walters said her 3-year-old, who has a compromised immune system, has been suffering from skin problems after bathing in the water. 
“We got bad water,” said City Councilman Eric Mays, who hosted the meeting. “If you buy a bad product, you return it for a refund.” 

The meeting was held hours after demonstrators gathered outside Flint City Hall to protest water quality and rising bills. The Him Journal reported , 
The city insists the water is safe.

Some Flint residents complain of skin problems from water 

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said officials needs to focus on how to improve the water. 

“I’m talking with people about water every single day,” Wailing said, “We need to work together as a community, with the cooperation of the state and 
federal government, to fix this issue.” 

Issues with the city’s water supply emerged after Flint stopped buying water from Detroit’s water department, Flint officials this month said they were 
dealing with elevated levels of a disinfection byproduct. 

Flint switched from using Lake Huron as its drinking water source in April, The city plans to use the Flint River as its water source until the end of 
2016, when the Karegnondi Water Authority expects to complete construction of a new Lake Huron water pipeline. 

Some want Flint to switch back to using Detroit’s water. 

Walling has supported the decision by state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley to hire a consultant to correct the treatment of water from the 
Flint River. G»v#Rick Snyder on Tuesday announced that Earley would be put in charge of the struggling Detroit Public Schools district. 

Earley said last week that going back to Detroit water was cost prohibitive and that the city “can ill-afford to switch course.”

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DRINKING WATER 


City of Flint Did Not Meet Treatment Requirements 

Our water system was recently found to be in violation of a drinking water standard. Although this incident was not 
an emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we are doing to correct this 
situation. 

We routinely monitor for the presence of drinking water contaminants. Samples were collected for total 
trihalomethanes {TTHM) analysis from eight locations on a quarterly basis (May 21, August 21, and November 20 of 
2014). The average of the results at ANY of the eight locations must not exceed the maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) for TTHMs, otherwise our water system exceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). The standard for 
TTHMs is 80 ug/l. The location reporting the highest TTHM level was 99 ug/L; thus, our water system exceeds the 
TTHM MCL. 

What should I do? 

« There is nothing you need to do unless you have a severely compromised immune system, have an infant, 
or are elderly. In that case, you may be at increased risk and should seek advice about drinking water from 
your health care provider. 

• You do not need to boil your water or take other corrective actions. If a situation arises where the water is 
no longer safe to drink, you will be notified within 24 hours. 

What does this mean? 

This is not an emergency. If it had been an emergency, you would have been notified within 24 hours. 

People vyho drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the MCL over many years may experience problems 
with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer. : 

What is being done? 

We are currently working on solutions to correct the problem. We anticipate resolving the problem in 2015. 

For more information, please contact Mr. Brent Wright or Mike Glasgow at 810-787-5537 or the Water Plant at 4500 
North Dort Highway, Flint, Ml 48505. 

Please share this information with all the other people who drink this water, especially those who may not have 
received this notice directly (for example, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses). You can 
do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies by hand or mail. 

This notice is being sent to you by the City of Flint.

City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests 
revealed too much disinfection byproduct 

Ron Fonger 1 rfongerl@mlive.com By Ron Fonger | rfongerl@miive.com

FLINT, MI — The city says there's been too much disinfection byproduct in Flint’s water system recently, 
something that — over many years could cause liver, kidney or central nervous system problems and an 
increased risk of cancer. 

The notice from the city says Flint water is safe to drink but warns those with "a severely compromised 
immune system, (who) have an infant or are elderly" that they "may be at increased risk and should seek 
advice about drinking water from your health care provider." 

For others, there is no need to boil water or take other actions, the notice says. 

"It 's been a rocky road," City Council President Josh Freeman said. "It's not acceptable. 

"People have a reasonable expectation that they are going to have quality drinking water. This is obviously 
going to rattle people." 

Mailed Friday, Jan. 2, the customer notices come after the state Department of Environmental Quality issued 
a notice of violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act for maximum contaminant levels for trihalomethanes — 
or TTHM — a group of four chemicals that are formed as a byproduct of disinfecting water. 

As city water plant operators used additional chlorine to fight bacteria in the Flint water system this summer, 
disinfectant byproduct levels also likely increased, city officials said Friday. 

Levels of TTHM have decreased since that time, and in Nov. 20, testing at eight locations showed only one 
that exceeded maximum contamination levels, according to the state's notice of violation. 

Testing on Aug. 21 showed contaminant levels were higher than maximum levels allowed at each of the 
same eight locations. 

"The water in our system today is not in violation" because of efforts to improve the distribution system and 
adjust water treatment, said Doughtery Johnson, utilities administrator at the Flint water treatment plant. 

Those changes "have likely contributed in part to the reduction in TTHM levels reported in the most recent

quarter, and suggest the city may be able to achieve compliance with the TTHM standard, 1 ' the state’s 
violation notice says. 

City officials released a statement Friday saying its actions "appear to have corrected ... known compliance 
issues with the system, including a recent temporary increase in the maximum contamination level (MCL) of 
trihalomethanes (TTHM) 

"Both the city of Fiint and the MDEQ expect the corrective measures being implemented will resolve the 
issue by early 2015," the statement says. 

The city's recent violation for excessive disinfectant byproducts is the latest in a series of issues for the Flint 
water system since officials changed the water source pumped to homes and business from treated Lake 
Huron water purchased from the city of Detroit to water drawn directly from the Flint River and treated in 
Flint. 

The use of Flint River water is expected to be temporary because the city is a partner in the Karegnondi 
Water Authority, which is building a new water pipeline to Lake Huron. 

Once that system is put into service, something that's expected to happen by the end of 2016, Fiint will be 
in a position to return to using lake water. 

Freeman said that long-term plan remains "the right path to be on" and said the city appears to be on 
course to fix the problem of disinfection byproduct levels, but Councilman Eric Mays called on the City 
Council to hold an inquiry about drinking water quality. 

"Sworn information given under oath is the only information I trust," Mays said. 

Residents have complained to the council about the smell and taste of the water since Flint stopped the flow 
of lake water here and there were three boil water advisories in a 22-day span this summer after positive 
tests for total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria. 

In October, Genera! Motors announced that it would no longer use treated river water at its engine plant 
here because of fears high chloride levels would cause corrosion. 

Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft said that the city's aging water distribution system 
remains the biggest obstacle to meeting Safe Drinking Water standards but officials have also said the 
relatively low quality of untreated river water and the need to more carefully manage chemical treatment 
has also been a factor. 

Croft told a City Council committee in September that river water has proven hard to treat and to keep safe 
because of variables that wouldn't be factors in lake water, like temperature fluctuation and rain.

But Croft said the city has made improvements to its distribution system and said additional improvements 
are on the way, including pipe replacements, leak detection and hydraulic monitoring. 

Johnson said the size of Flint's water system, which once served more than 200,000 people and now serves 
about half that number, also makes keeping water fresh in distribution pipes difficult. 

Stagnant water is more susceptible to contamination, officials have said. 

Flint will remain in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act until every test site in the city has acceptable 
levels of disinfectant byproducts, Johnson and Croft said. 

The next round of testing is scheduled to take place in February.

Lower TTHM levels put Flint in compliance with Safe Drinking 
Water Act 

Ron Fonger | rfongerl@mlive.com By Ron Fonger 1 rfongerl@mlive.com

FLINT, MI — The city is no longer in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act because the level of 
total trihalomethanes in water samples collected last month has fallen, the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality says. 

The DEQ notified the city of the test results in a letter Wednesday, Sept. 2, ending eight months of the city 
under a violation of the act. The city will no longer have to send water customers warning notices about 
TTHM levels. 

"Creative measures by the city have been successful in achieving compliance with this standard," reads the 
letter from Michael F. Prysby of the DEQ. "These measures have included replacement of anthracite filter- 
media with granular activated carbon as well as the optimization of water treatment plant and distribution 
system processes and operations as recommended through operational evaluations conducted by the city. 

"It is important that the city continue to follow these recommendations in order to limit disinfection 
byproduct formation and maintain compliance (with state requirements)," the letter says. "While 
(requirements have) now been met at all eight compliance sampling sites, an individual TTHM concentration 
above (80 parts per billion) was measured at one location ... in August 2015." 

The location of the highest TTHM test in August was at Salem Housing, 3216 King Boulevard, which 
registered 90 ppb. Flint’s violation of the federal law was the result of the annual average of TTHM above 80 
ppb at a minimum of one of the eight testing locations. 

City officials have said they expected improved TTHM levels after the installation of the new $1.6 million 
carbon filter this summer. 

"The city of Flint is continuing to improve its water system, including both the areas of treatment and 
distribution," Mayor Dayne Walling said in a news release issued by the city Thursday, Aug. 3. 

TTHM is a colorless, odorless byproduct of chlorinating water with high levels of total organic carbon. The 
city began having problems managing TTHM after it began using the Flint River as its water source in April 
2014.

Lower TTHM levels put Flint in compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act 


Page 2 of 2 


In past notices mailed to Flint water customers, the city has warned that drinking water with excess 
amounts of TTHM can pose increased health risks for those with a compromised immune system, the elderly, 
pregnant women and infants. 

The good news on TTHM comes the day after researchers at Virginia Tech published an online report, saying 
tests show Flint drinking water is "very corrosive" and is "causing lead contamination in homes." 

A statement from Walling on the lead issue says the city will work with the DEQ on a plan aimed at reducing 
the corrosive effects of water on older transmission pipes and home service lines.

Scary: Leaded Water and One Flint Family’s 
Toxic Nightmare 


July 9th, 2015, 11:28 PM 

Lika : 2 j 61 

Curt Guyette is an investigative reporter for the ACLU of Michigan. His work, funded by a grant from the Ford 
Foundation, focuses on emergency management and open government. He writes regularly for Michigan 
Democracy Watch Blog, (http://www.aclumich.org/democracywatch/index.php/entry/harcl-to-swallow-toxic-water- 
in-a-toxic-system) 

By Curt Guyette 

It took a while for LeeAnne Waiters to realize the full impact of the number: 13,200. 

Walters — a stay-at home mom with four sons and a husband in 
the Navy — had seen other numbers reflecting the quality of 
drinking water at her Flint home that were devastating. But 
13,200? She’d never seen anything like this. 

The city had tested her water twice in this past March and both 
times found dangerously high levels of lead — 104 parts per 
billion (ppb) and 397 ppb, respectively. 

Those numbers filled her with dread, because they meant her family had been exposed to high 
levels of a terribly toxic heavy metal that put her children’s future in jeopardy. 

But it was the result of a third test of the tap water in her home, performed by independent 
experts at Virginia Tech University, that most stunned Walters. 

“It took a while for me to wrap my head around it,” said Walters. 

The VT researchers discovered lead levels in Walters’ water reached a jaw-dropping 13,200 
ppb — more than twice the amount at which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies

water as hazardous waste. 

“When I saw those numbers i was shocked,” said Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, a 
former MacArthur Fellow and respected authority on corrosion in drinking-water systems, who 
oversaw the tests. 

Edwards played a key role in discovering and addressing the problem of corroded water pipes 
and lead in Washington, D.C. during the early 2000s, in whafs described as the worst 
contamination crisis ever seen in a major urban water system. 

In terms of lead levels, the Walters family's numbers eclipsed even the worst D.C. homes. 

“I have never in my 25-year career seen such outrageously high levels going into another home 
in the United States,” said Edwards. “This was literally hazardous-waste levels." 

But the condition of Walters’ tap water raises a much more far-reaching question: Since the city 
moved away from Detroit’s water system and began pumping water from the Flint River, how 
many other families have been put at risk by the city’s questionable testing procedures and 
handling of the water supply? 

The Walters family surely isn’t alone in dealing with the threat of lead-laced drinking water. Flint 
has tens of thousands of homes that are a half-century old or older, built at a time when water 
service lines were typically made of lead. 

And according to various experts, including an EPA water-quality specialist, the city’s actions are 
only exacerbating the threat. 

"What the public needs is accurate information,” explained Miguel Del Toral, regulations manager 
for the Ground Water and Drinking Water Branch of the ERA'S Region 5. 

Instead, the city is utilizing testing measures that almost ensure that worst-case scenarios such 
as the one facing the Walters family escape detection, asserted Del Toral in an internal EPA 
memo provided to the ACLU of Michigan. 

Compounding the threat is what Del Toral describes as the continued inability of officials to 
adequately treat water coming into people’s homes from the Flint River, 

“I don’t want to scare people unnecessarily,” said Del Toral in a phone interview from his home in 
Chicago. “But there is absolutely a problem in Flint that needs to be addressed right away.” 

During his interview with the ACLU of Michigan, De! Toral said he was willing to go on the record 
with his concerns, but that he was doing so as a private citizen, not as a representative of the 
EPA. 

EPA rules, he said, required that such interviews be routed through the agency’s public affairs 
people. But he's willing to speak out nonetheless, he said, because of the potential harm to the 
public is so great. 

WATERING DOWN THE TESTS 

Perhaps the most vexing problem in all of this is the contamination caused by the city’s 
decades-old network of lead and iron pipes — a problem directly connected to the switch to river

water, and the city’s failure to adequately treat it. 

Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules, if 
lead reaches a level of 15 parts per billion in water, the source 
of the problem must be identified and corrected. 

In early March, after months of requests (and only after Walters 
had received a doctor’s note raising concerns about problems 
with the water), the city finally conducted a test. It found lead 
levels of 1 04 ppb the first time. A second test recorded a level 
of 397 ppb. 

Blood tests, taken after those water-sample numbers were reported, revealed that one of her 
children, a four year old, had lead poisoning. 

The news was devastating, said Walters, and the concern it creates for her child’s future is 
haunting. 

“Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body,” according to the EPA’s web site. 
“Children six years old and younger are most susceptible ... Even low levels of lead in the blood 
of children can result in: behavior and learning problems: lower IQ and hyperactivity: slowed 
growth; and hearing problems.” 

Those dangers made Walters all the more determined to get her questions answered. 

For one thing, she wanted to know why residents were being instructed to “pre-flush” water lines 
before drawing samples that would be tested by the city 

After much searching, she found Del Toral at the EPA’s Region 5 in Chicago. He explained to her 
that her instincts were right, and that she had good cause to be concerned about the way testing 
was being done. 

“The practice of pre-flushing before collecting compliance samples has been shown to result in 
the minimization of lead capture and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water,” 
wrote Del Toral in an internal memo dated June 24. 

Del Toral went on to say that the city’s testing methods were a “serious concern” because they 
“could provide a false sense of security to the residents of Flint regarding lead levels in the 
water.” As a result, he warned, residents could fail to take the necessary precautions to protect 
their families from lead in the drinking water. 

Virginia Tech’s Edwards completely agrees with Del Torahs assessment. 

“The net effect of a ‘pre-flush’ is to greatly reduce the likelihood of detecting lead in samples 
collected ... that would normally be present in the consumers drinking water,” Edwards wrote in 
an email. “I have long maintained that the practice should be banned, as it artificially lowers the 
amount of lead detected in samples versus typical consumer exposure.” 

Asked about these concerns, city spokesman Jason Lorenz offered the following email reply: 
“While i cannot directly respond to Mr, Del Toral's remarks without first contacting the EPA

Region 5 office, i can say that the City of Flint follows all the testing procedures and schedules as 
required by the U.S. EPA.” 

He added that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) endorses the city’s 
sampling method. The MDEQ did not respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking its comments 
on the controversy. 

Del Toral contended in an interview that what Flint's doing is actually exploiting a “loophole” in the 
law. 

“From a technical standpoint, there’s no justification for the way Flint is conducting its tests,” Del 
Toral said. “Any credible scientist will tell you [the city’s] method is not the way to catch 
worst-case conditions.” 

There is no legitimate reason for the city’s methodology, said Del Toral. 

During his interview with the ACLU of Michigan, Del Toral said he was willing to go on the record 
with his concerns, but that he was doing so as a private citizen, not as a representative of the 
EPA. 

EPA rules, he said, required that such interviews be routed through the agency’s public affairs 
people. But he was willing to speak out nonetheless, he said, because of the potential harm to 
the public. 

FLUSHING OUT REAL ANSWERS 

it was Dei Toral who, after determining that the lead problem plaguing the Walters family was 
coming from outside their home, connected LeeAnne with Edwards at Virginia Tech. 

Instead of taking a single sample after a line had been “pre-flushed” under the city’s direction, 
Edwards instructed Walters to collect a series of samples from water that had been allowed to sit 
in the service line long enough to accurately reflect levels the family could be exposed to under 
normal use. 

(Meanwhile, that same service line, dug up and replaced after the sample collection, was found 
to be made of lead in one section and iron in another.) 

Edwards tested the water and discovered that the lead contamination ranged from 200 ppb to the 
13,200 ppb figure that stunned LeeAnne Walters — and should likewise shock many others. 

Given the age of much of Flint’s infrastructure, Edwards agrees with Del Toral’s assessment that 
the test results they found at the Walters home amount to an alarm going off, and others in the 
city need to pay attention. 

“1 do not see any reason why there would not be serious problems occurring in at least some 
other Flint homes,” said Edwards, 

In 1986, the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act was amended to prohibit the use of lead pipes in public 
water systems. Every house built before that is potentially at risk, said Edwards. About half of 
Flint’s roughly 40,000 homes are at least 50 years old. 

Making things worse is the fact that the high levels of chlorine being used to treat Flint’s dirty river

water lead to the creation of a carcinogenic byproduct know as total trihalomenhanes, or TTH7M. 
To keep TTHM levels down, the city is adding ferric chloride. The trouble is, that additive can also 
accelerate the corrosion of lead and iron pipes. 

Adding yet another layer to the problem is something the city is not doing. 

According to Del Toral, Flint should be adding corrosion-control chemicals designed to help keep 
lead and copper in pipes from leaching into drinking water. Doing so is required by federal 
regulations, wrote Del Toral in his memo. 

“To our knowledge, that is inaccurate,” said Flint spokesman Lorenz. “Before the plant was 
placed in operation, the City (and our engineering firm) had numerous discussions with DEQ 
personnel and inquired if corrosion-control chemicals - typically phosphates -needed to be 
included in the treatment process. The use of these chemicals was not required or mandated." 

What's indisputable is this: 

Flint's water contained corrosion-control chemicals until April 2014, when Flint’s ties to the Detroit 
water system were severed. Flint officials hailed that changeover as a cost-cutting move for a city 
facing a financial crisis so severe it had been placed under the control of a state-appointed 
emergency manager. 

Discontinuing the use of the anti-corrosion chemicals allowed toxic scale built up on the insides 
of pipes over the past decades to be released into water flowing into people’s homes, explained 
Dei Toral. 

In his memo, Del Toral warned: “The lack of mitigating treatment is especially concerning as the 
high lead levels [that result] will likely not be reflected in the City of Flint's compliance samples 
due to sampling procedures used...” 

In other words, at the same time the city is exacerbating the problem, it’s conducting tests that 
will probably fail to identity the true extent of the threat. 

Del Toral described the situation as a “major concern.” 

“In the absence of any corrosion control treatment, lead levels in drinking water can be expected 
to increase," he warned in his memo. 

The EPA offered Flint officials the use of agency experts to help get the situation under control, 
said Del Toral, but added that, to his knowledge, the city has so far declined all help. 

LeeAnne Walters said that when she asked why city officials weren’t taking the EPA’s offer of 
assistance, she was told, “We don't need it." 

Flint spokesman Lorenz, on the other hand, maintained that “the city continues to work closely 
with the MDEQ and the EPA Regional Office.” 

As for Walters’s family, that the city has finally replaced the service line leading to their home, 
and lead levels have dropped below the 15 ppb EPA action level. 

The problem now, she said, is that water currently coming out of her tap tinged yellow and smells 
of rotten eggs. City officials have given her no explanation as to the possible cause of that.

It is just one more in a long list of questions that need to be addressed, 

“What we need," said Walters, “are more answers." 

But it’s not just answers the people of Flint require. 

They also need solutions. And, as Del Toral’s EPA memo emphasizes, they need them 
immediately.

FLINT, MI — Flint drinking water is "very 
corrosive" and "causing lead contamination 
in homes," researchers from Virginia Tech 
University reported online Wednesday, Sept. 2.

"On a scientific basis, Flint River water leaches more lead from plumbing than does Detroit water," the report 
concludes. "This is creating a public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead soider." 


The Virginia Tech report comes as students there, overseen by Professor Marc Edwards, are in the final days 
of testing water collected from 300 sample kits distributed to Flint residents. 

On Monday, Aug. 31, the researchers reported 42 percent of 120 initial samples from Flint had lead levels 
that were more than 5 parts per billion, "which suggests a serious lead-in-water problem, according to our 
experience and criteria." 

Virginia Tech was initially contacted by a Flint resident who had concerns about lead in Flint water. It has 
been working with citizen groups in Flint such as Water You Fighting For. 

Twenty percent of the first samples also exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lead action limit 
of 15 ppb, the report said. 

The EPA requires water systems like Flint's to collect tap samples from sites that are more likely to have 
plumbing materials containing lead. 

If more than 10 percent of samples exceed 15 ppb, then water systems are required to take action, 
including steps to optimize corrosion control treatment. 


Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many years in products found in and around homes, according to 
EPA. 


"Even at low levels, lead may cause a range of health effects, including behavioral problems and learning 
disabilities," EPA's website says. "Children 6 years ofd and under are most at risk because this is when the

The Virginia Tech report on Fiint River water comes two days after representatives of three organizations 
delivered more than 26,000 online petition signatures to Mayor Dayne Walling, demanding the city end 
its use of the Flint River and reconnect the city to the Detroit water system. 

The petition language says high lead levels are one reason the city should no longer use the river as a 
drinking water source. 

Walling and Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft issued statements in response to questions 
about lead in Flint water Wednesday after Croft declined to discuss the issue in a news conference Tuesday. 

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz said the two would not comment further Wednesday. 

"The city of Flint is currently in compliance with the safety mandates of the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality and continues to work with them to stay in compliance with all safety and quality 
standards," Croft's statement said. "We have also been in constant contact with Virginia Tech, sharing 
information as it becomes available." 

Walling, who has supported Flint's continued use of the Flint River as a drinking water source, said, "Lead 
can be a concern in communities with older public and private infrastructure. 

"The city of Flint has offered free and independent testing to residents since spring, and I encourage people 
to use this service if they have questions," Walling's statement said. 

Edwards, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, said the elevated lead levels he has seen in 
Flint tap water are tied to a corrosive water source that contains about eight times more chloride than 
Detroit water does. 

"Chloride is generally considered to be very corrosive to iron. For instance, chloride present in road salts 
applied in the winter causes iron in cars and bridges to rust," the Virginia Tech team's website says. 

"This could be a huge public health problem. ... The Flint water just ate the pipe up," Edwards said of the 
testing he has overseen so far. 

In the testing, researchers took copper pipe pieces joined with lead solder inside them, according to the 
report, which says lead solder is probably present in plumbing systems of many Flint homes built before 
1986. 

Lead solder-copper pipe test pieces were placed in containers filled with water from Detroit and Flint in the 
experiment, according to the report.

"If it were me, I would not be using (Flint River water) for cooking or drinking unless I had it tested for 
lead," said Edwards, who previously mounted a six-year campaign that succeeded in forcing the U.S. 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to admit it had misled the public about the risk of lead in the 
Washington, D.C., area's drinking water, according to The Washington Post. 

"Bottled or filtered water (is what I would use for) children under 6 years old or if I was pregnant," he said. 

Brad Wurfel, communications director for the state Department of Environmental Quality, said the 
preliminary water testing results from Virginia Tech don't jibe with two separate rounds of testing during the 
past year by the city. 

That testing indicated "Flint drinking water meets state and federal safe drinking water standards," Wurfel 
said. 

Wurfel said lead levels detected in testing are not the result of water containing lead when it leaves Flint's 
treatment plant, But he said the state "has requested Flint optimize its water treatment to further limit 
exposure to lead from plumbing in homes." 

The concerns about lead are the latest challenge for the Flint water system since the city started using the 
Flint River to replace Lake Huron water sold by the city of Detroit in April 2014. 

Since the switch, the city has been plagued by issues such as water main breaks and boil water advisories 
because of bacteria and has been in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of high levels of total 
trihalomethanes (TTHM), a byproduct of chlorinating river water. 

The Rev. Allen Overton, who hand-delivered petitions to Walling on Monday, asking that city officials 
reconnect the Flint water system to Detroit, said Wednesday that the Virginia Tech experiment is more 
evidence Flint is not using the best quality of water available. 

"We have a major health issue here, (and) they are not being honest with the citizens of Flint," Overton 
said. 

City Council President Josh Freeman said the city has been willing to provide customers with free water 
testing and has taken action — such as installing a new $1.6 million filtration system — to address problems 
such as TTHM. 

Councilman Eric Mays said, as more water testing is done, it becomes dearer that Flint should be negotiating 
with Detroit for a new, short-term water contract as work continues on the Karegnondi Water Authority 
pipeline. 

The pipeline, a partnership between the city and Genesee County, is expected to bring untreated Lake Huron

We are now three weeks into our laboratory experiment w.r.t. testing the 
relative corrosivitv of Flint River water versus Detroit water 
(http:/ 7flintwaterstudv.org/ 2015/09/ flint-rivers-water-is-very-corrosive-to- 
lead-and-causing-lead-contamination-in-homes/) . As the test continues, it 
becomes a more accurate measure of the relative corrosivity of the two 
waters. We previously noted, that it would be expected that Flint River water 
would be much more corrosive than Detroit water, due to its higher chloride 
content.

Experiment: When we visited Flint, we took pieces of copper pipe joined 
with lead solder (old solder is 50% lead by weight 

(http://www.copper.Org/environment/water/e p lead.html)) inside them. 

Lead solder is probably present in the plumbing of many Detroit/Flint homes 
built before 1986 when it was banned from use in drinking water systems 
(http://www.copper.Org/environment/water/e p lead.html) . We put the 
lead solder-copper pipe test pieces in 250 mL containers, and filled them 
with the following three waters: 

Test l) Detroit water 

Test 2) Current Flint River water 

Test 3) Current Flint River water with orthophosphate (a typical corrosion 
inhibitor (http://www.lenntech.com/products/chemicals/water-treatment- 
chemicals.htm#Corrosion%20inhibitors)) 

Test 3 was conducted, to see if adding orthophosphate to Flint River water 
would stop lead corrosion. About 50% of water companies in the U.S. add 
orthophosphate to their water to control lead corrosion, but it is not 
currently added to Flint River water. 

Results and Observations:

Figure 1 - Data from Week 3 comparing lead corrosion in Detroit water (left), current Flint water 
(middle), and Flint water with orthophosphate (right) 


From the data shown above in Figure 1, it is clear that Detroit water is much 
less corrosive to lead solder than the Flint River water. On average, Detroit 
water is 19 times (or 19X) less corrosive than the Flint River water 
currently in use. That is, the current Flint River water leaches 19X more 
lead to the water than Detroit water. This explains why the lead in Flint’s 
water in our survey, is so high, (http://flintwaterstudv.org/information-for- 
flint-residents/results-for-citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/) even when it 
was low before when Detroit water was being used. 

We can actually still see the high lead in the Flint River water test by eye (i.e. 
as white particles suspended in the water 

(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/09/flint-rivers-water-is-very-corrosive-to- 
lead-and-causing-lead-contamination-in-homes/)) . Lead levels in our test 
with Flint River water, were slightly above hazardous waste levels (5000 
ppb), which is still lower than the worst levels of lead we detected in the

home of Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters 

(http: / / flintwaterstudy.org/ 2015/08 /hazardous-waste-levels-of-lead-found- 
in-a-flint-households-water/) . 

Orthophosphate still does not seem to help stop lead leaching in Flint 
River water, which is also consistent with expectations based on 
experiments in high chloride water 

(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010938X1100Q382) . 

There is a slight improvement, but even with phosphate, Flint River water 
has 16 times more lead compared to the same condition using Detroit water. 

We will continue to run these tests, but at present it does not seem like 
orthophosphate will provide a quick answer to the very high lead levels in 
Flint water. 

Conclusion: On a scientific basis, Flint River water leaches more lead 
from plumbing than does Detroit water as predicted before 
(http://flintwaterstudv.org/2015/08/whv-is-it-possible-that~flint-river- 
water-cannot-be-treated-to-meet-federal-standards/) . This is creating a 
public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead 
solder. Unfortunately, adding orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor to 
the Flint River water, does not solve the lead problem. 


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS 


We believe, that in the weeks and months ahead, MDEQ and Flint will be 
forced to admit they failed to protect public health as required under the 
Federal Lead and Copper Rule. The question that will then be asked is “What 
can be done to protect residents?” 

Step V. Issue Scientifically Sound Advice. 


http://flintvvaterstudy.org/2015/09/test-update-flint-river-water-19x-more-corrosive-than-d,.. 10/2/2015 



Test Update: Flint River water 1 9X more corrosive than Detroit water for Lead Solder; N... Page 5 of 1 2 

The first step is to admit that the water in Flint is not safe for cooking or 
drinking (http:// flintwaterstudv.org/ information-for-flint- 
residents/results-for-citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/) — a fact that MDEQ 
still denies. According to MDEQ statements provided to reporter Ronald 
Fonger this week, which were presented to us for comment, MDEQ’s Brad 
Wurfel asserts that: 


“ the issue here isn't Flint's water source or water plants. It's the high 
number of older homes with lead pipes and lead service 
connections.. ..Folks who have concerns should get a water specialist to 
take a look at their home and see what they need to do to achieve 
peace of mind, because lead and copper are home plumbing problems 
that no water source can eliminate entirely 


We note that this is the exact same position that MDEQ and the city took 
months ago, after Lee-Anne Walters’ child was lead poisoned from exposure 
to high lead in Flint water (http:/ / www.abcl2.com/home/headlines/Flint- 
mother-said-the-water-gave-her-son-Lead-poisoning-324496551.html) , After 
MDEQ and the City blamed Ms. Walters home plumbing for the problem, an 
EPA water specialist did come to her home and inspected her plumbing. His 
finding: There were no lead plumbing sources in her home 
(http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/file/EPAWaterReport062415.pdf) . 
How does that finding, provide Ms. Walters and other Flint residents, with 
“peace of mind?” 

Likewise, during our sampling events in Flint homes 
(http:/ / flintwaterstudv.org/ information-for-flint-residents/ results-for- 
citizen-testing-for-lead-300-kits/h we are finding very high lead in other 
homes with modern lead free plumbing, which again points to city owned 
lead pipes and corrosive water as the problem.

Test Update: Flint River water 19X more corrosive than Detroit water for Lead Solder; N... Page 6 of 12 


On the basis of these facts, we consider MDEQ’s position to be both 
unscientific and irresponsible, and we stand by our 
recommendations to Flint consumers, that they immediately reduce 
their exposure to high lead in Flint’s water by implementing 
protective measures when using tap water for drinking or cooking. 


Step 2. Implement Corrosion Control. 

The second step will ultimately require some sort of corrosion control 
treatment to reduce lead in Flint water. Three options are possible as 
detailed below: 

1. Switch back to the non-corrosive Detroit water. It is our opinion, 
based on years of experience, that Flint’s lead levels would drop 
markedly in about one month. 

2. Add orthophosphate to Flint River water. As indicated in this work, 
orthophosphate will not reduce lead leaching from all lead plumbing 
sources. On the basis of our extensive experience, we would only expect 
modest improvements to water lead levels if orthophosphate was 
added. 

3. Wait for KWA pipeline. If orthophosphate was added to water from 
the KWA pipeline, it would be about the same corrosivity as Detroit 
water (Option A). In that case, Flint residents will have to live with the 
very high lead in their water, until at least one month after the pipeline 
is connected. 

Politicians and residents will ultimately have to look at which of the above 
options is best for Flint, after weighing feasibility and costs.

FLINT, MI -- City officials insist their 
own testing shows Flint water is 
safe and within federal guidelines 
for lead. 


Flint Journal file photo 


But those same tests also show lead levels have been rising since the city began using the Flint River 
for water 16 months ago. 

The results of Flint's testing for lead since 1992, released by the state Department of Environmental 
Quality to The Flint Joumal-MLive, show 10 percent of homes sampled in the city's most recent 
testing contained 11 parts per billion or more of lead, with six of 69 samples exceeding the federal 
lead limit of 15 ppb. 

Those are the highest lead levels measured in Flint by the city in more than 20 years, the state data 
shows. 


In contrast, the city's tests of Lake Huron water from Detroit for one 10-year period -- from June 
2001 until September 2011 — resulted in just one of 155 samples registering higher than 15 ppb of 
lead. 


Flint began treating river water in April 2014 after Detroit terminated an expired contract for selling 
water to the city. The cutoff came after Flint joined Genesee County to form the Karegnondi Water 
Authority, which is building a new pipeline to Lake Huron, a project that's expected to be completed 
sometime next year. 

City and state officials have pointed to their own testing as evidence that Flint water is safe and 
under the 15 ppb limit, but have said little about the lead level drifting up. 

Marc Edwards, who is supervising separate water testing in Flint by Virginia Tech University, 
said there's no mistaking the pattern.

"The Flint River — based on the chemistry — has an obvious propensity for lead to be released to 
water," Edwards said. "There should have been red lights flashing (when the city began using the 
river in April 2014) — knowing that if you put that water into Flint's system without corrosion control, 
you're going to see a massive lead release." 

That release is what Edwards' testing has shown as 10 percent of homes sampled by students and 
faculty from Virginia Tech have had lead levels of at least 25 ppb. 

Since the testing started, Mayor Dayne Walling announced Flint would speed up development of a 
plan for reducing corrosiveness of city water and called for $10 million in state funds to begin 
replacing lead and lead solder in water service lines and plumbing. 

Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft would not attribute higher lead levels to the 
river alone, but said the source of the water is one variable as is the amount of time water is 
stagnant in pipes. 

"Lead is in there. It’s always been there," Croft said. "We would like there to be no lead, (but) I'm 
happy how aggressively we are responding" to what the city has. 

Steve Busch, Lansing and Jackson district supervisor in the DEQ's office of drinking water and 
municipal assistance, said lead testing results vary in many areas and a shift doesn't necessarily 
show Flint River water is more susceptible to higher lead levels than lake water. 

"We see numbers fluctuate with the same treatment and the same water," Busch said. "We have 
levels go up and down from monitoring round to monitoring round." 

Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many year in products found in and around homes, according 
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Even at low levels, lead may cause health effects such 
as behavioral problems and learning disabilities. 

Current regulations for lead in water began in 1992 and require a limited amount of testing to 
measure the degree to which lead leaches into tap water after flowing through lead service lines and 
lead solder in home plumbing. 

If more than 10 percent of tap water samples from water systems exceed 15 ppb, the water system 
can be required to take steps like making water less corrosive or replacing lead service lines. 

Since the ERA announced its lead and copper rule in 1991, Flint has collected 33 samples every six to 
36 months but the number of tests increased after the city changed its water source to the river,

according to state data. 

State records show 100 samples were collected from Flint in the last six months of 2014, showing 
two sites with readings of more than 15 ppb of lead and 10 percent of homes registering at 6 ppb or 
more. 

From January until June this year, the city collected just 69 samples, a reduction that was allowed 
because Flint's population had dropped below 100,000, Busch said. 

The last time testing by the city showed a higher percentage of water samples above 11 parts per 
billion was 1992, immediately after new lead and copper rules went into effect. 

In that case, the city of Detroit took five years to develop a plan to better control corrosion and lead 
levels and brought lead levels down from a high of 15 ppb in 10 percent of samples taken in Flint.

The water in Flint is likely poisoning kids. 

That’s what pediatricians in the city say, after looking at lead levels in young children before 
and after the city switched the source of its drinking water from the Detroit water system to 
the Flint River.

There's a long list of complaints about Flint's water. But physicians are really concerned about this one.

“My research shows that lead levels have gone up. I cannot say it's from the water, but that’s 
the thing that has happened," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician with Huriey 
Children's Hospital. 

Hanna-Attisha says she decided to look into blood-lead levels after researchers from 
Virginia Tech found elevated lead levels in tap water due to the corrosive nature of the river 
water. 

She analyzed blood test results of 1,746 children age five and younger from Flint, and 1,670 
non-Flint children. Before the switch, 2.1% of Flint children had elevated blood lead levels. 
After the switch, that rate jumped to 4%. By comparison, the rate for non-Flint children 
went from .6% to 1%, which Hanna-Attisha says is statistically insignificant. 

She calls the city’s response to water quality problems "inadequate,” and says precautions 
need to be taken immediately. 

"Because the impact of not doing anything will haunt us for years to come," says Hanna- 
Attisha, citing interventions like special education, lost productivity, and incarceration costs 
associated with high' lead levels. “The cost will be astronomical in decades to come. So we 
cannot wait until this year or next year. We have to think five years from now, ten years 
from now.” 

Hanna-Attisha and other physicians are urging the city to issue an advisory about how to 
minimize exposure to lead in the water. The county health department says it’s drafting that 
advisory now. 

The news about the elevated lead levels did not surprise Lee Anne Walters. She found out 
her son had alarmingly high lead levels in April of this year. 

"I kept talking to the doctors, trying to figure out why he wasn’t growing,” says Walters. “He 
was 27 pounds at four years old. His hair was thinning, breaking out in rashes." 

Walters says her son would get a rash when he took baths. There would be a line on his body 
that corresponded with where the bath water ended. Above it, his skin was fine. Below it, 
where his skin was underwater, he’d get a rash.

"The doctors in the city gave me a hard time testing my kids,” says Walters. "I took them out 
the city to a dermatologist down in Brighton, who ran the test and called me personally to 
tell me that he did have lead poisoning and anemia from the lead poisoning, and he’s having 
speech problems.” 

It turns out the rash was probably from a chlorine byproduct the city had to dump into the 
river water to kill the E. coli that had made people sick the summer before. 

People knew that chemical - it’s called TTHM - was a problem. But lead wasn’t on many 
people’s radar until a guy named Marc Edwards came to town. 

Edwards is a researcher from Virginia Tech. 

His tests of Flint tap water found lead levels 
in some homes that were higher than federal 
regulators allow - and a lot higher than the 
city found in the tests it conducted. He says 
the river water is so corrosive it’s eating the 
lead from old pipes and solder. 

"That's why we are actually asking for 

funding to help with infrastructure,” said Flint City Administrator Natasha Henderson. “It’s 
not a secret that the city is very financially distressed." 

Henderson and other city officials say they’re working with state and federal regulators to 
get a handle on the problem. 

But they're quick to point out that the city's own tests show it’s in compliance with the Safe 
Drinking Water Act. 

But activists say they don’t trust how the city arrived at that conclusion, and point to the 
Virginia Tech results as evidence that the city has been conducting flawed testing. 

"I want them to take responsibility,” says Lee Anne Walters, the mother whose son has 
experienced health problems since the switch. "I want them to quit poisoning their citizens.” 


"8 want them to take 
responsibility. I want them 
to quit poisoning their 

citizens."

michigan man • 

Let's be clear... this situation is at least partly a result of massive cuts in state revenue 
sharing, which led the city to take dramatic steps to cut its costs... and now people are 
paying the price. But hey, we cut taxes at the state ievei (and our per cap income is still 
in the bottom 15 in the nation). 


Allison MacArthur-Ruesink • 

This has nothing to do with Cost Cuts. The MDEQ is rife with corruption, 
perhaps the "employee" who had oversight of this facility was also 
hired and promoted based upon a family connection with a member of the Water 
Division’s "Hot Tub Club" instead of experience and education!? I 
complained about the problems as far back as the early 2000's, even to Governor 
Grandholm's husband via Reading for Leading. Nothing was corrected !! Employees 
who speak out are harassed mercilessly and even worse as in my case. When i did 
not voluntarily retire after being asked 3x by MDEQ’s Jon E. Russell, he conspired 
and fabricated a case to get rid of mel! I took a polygraph from Forensic 
Polygraph Services (Mr. Neil Myers) to prove I was telling the truth 

but Michigan's corrupt Attorney General Bill Schuette and his equally corrupt 
Assistant AG Joseph Yung-Kung Ho (P-77390) have denied me any measure of 
Justice!! It is not a coincidence that the Judge involved with my case Thomas 
Wilson Jackson County Michigan used to work for the AG's Office. Everything was 
filed in a timely manner!! The MDEQ have even refused my receiving copies of my 
OWN PERSONNEL FILE! This is Michigan's way of saying "Thanks for 30 years 
of Service" They pulled this BS 65 days before my 55th birthday so they 
could deny my collecting my Retirement Benefits before age 60. Does someone 
have to die before the Bureaucracy cleans its own house?! Read "Well of 
Lies" about how inept and unqualified public servants who are unqualified 
or just plain corrupt, can injure innocent people!!

Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch

Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch 


By Robin Erb, Detruti Free Press 6:44 p.m. EDT September 25 r 2015 


Number of Flint children with lead poisoning jumps after Flint water switch, says researcher, 



Flint's ongoing water woes are now associated with an immediate and irreversible danger — possible lead 
poisoning of some of the city’s children, according to a review of blood test results by a Hurley Children’s 
Hospital pediatrician, 

i was hoping not to find anything, but what we found ... is concerning," said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha who also 
leads the pediatric residency program at Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine, 


(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free 
Press) 


‘This is not something you mess around with," she said. “Our population already has so many issues from 
poverty, from unemployment, from violence." 


State officials say their own review of blood test results have not shown the same increase that Hanna-Attisha found. Moreover, water tests have similarly 
shown lead within federally accepted levels, they say. 

Hanna-Attisha examined results from blood samples of Genesee County children taken both before and after the city ended its water contract with the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department fhttoT/www.dwsd.oro/l and began pulling water from the Flint River. 


The number of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels — 5 micrograms per deciliter or more — jumped from 2.1% in the 20 months prior to Sept. 
15, 2013, to 4.0% between Jan. 1 and Sept. 15 this year. In certain ZIP Codes, the change was even more troubling, she said — jumping from 2.5% of 
the children tested to 6.3%. 


Blood is often drawn by pediatricians as part of routine lead-level testing, especially among children who are on Medicaid. That gave Hanna-Attisha 1,746 
test results from Flint children to compare against 1 ,640 results from elsewhere in Genesee County. Children in Genesee County outside of Flint showed 
no significant increase in blood-lead levels. 

Health officials have said no lead levels are safe fhttD://www.cdc.aov/ncelVleadn . Lead can lead to serious developmental problems, reducing a child's IQ 
and causing serious behavioral and emotional problems. Though levels can fall in individuals over time, the damage is permanent. 

If Hanna-Attisha's analysis is correct, this upward trend in Flint interrupts years of progress in reducing dangerous blood-lead levels. 

State data show that the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels have been falling for years. In fact in 2013, 3.6% of Flint children 
younger than 6 had elevated blood-lead levels, compared with the state-wide rate of 3.9%. 

Though Hanna-Attisha's review didn't try to determine cause, "we can't think of another reason" for the trend other than the change in Flint's water 
source. 


The review is sure to ratchet up tension in Flint. 

In 2014, city officials ended the city's contract f/storvfoews/local/michiaan/2015/01/22/w3*er-woes-latest-hst-flint/22193291/1 with the Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department fhtto;//www.dwsd.oroa saying that water costs were too high. They opted instead to pull from the Karegnondi Water Authority, 
which is building a system to supply Genesee County with water pulled from Lake Huron. In the long am, this will mean lower wafer costs, officials have 
said. 


But until the new system comes online in 2016, Flint is temporarily pulling water from the Flint River. Since it made Ihe switch, residents have complained 
that the water smells, is discolored and makes them sick. 

Soon after the switch, tests indicated the presence of coliform bacteria, which can suggest the presence of other disease-carrying pathogens. The water 
was then treated with disinfectants, and city officials maintain the water is safe. 

The question is not that whether there is a higher level of lead in water from the Flint River — it's that river water may be more corrosive as it travels 
through lead pipes on residential properties and in homes, said Brad Wurfei, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. About 
1 5,000 of the 40,000 Flint customers have lead pipes connecting to the city system, he said. 

But he said testing has shown that lead levels in the Flint water system — both before and after the switch in 2014 — have been under the acceptable 
limit of 15 parts per billion during every three-year testing cycle since 1992. Additionally, two rounds of supplemented tests since the system switch put

lead levels at 6 parts per billion and then at 11 parts per billion — a change that Wurfel said fits in line with previous fluctuations. 

Congressman Dan Kildee, a Flint Democrat, called state and local testing "lackluster,” 

For one thing, Flint residents collect samples, and there are concerns that there are foo few samples and that they represent only some parts of the 
city. And Wurfe! confirmed that about 60 bottles of water samples were turned in by citizens in the last round of testing, even though 200 bottles were 
sent out. 

I n the best of circumstances — with enough sampling and previous clean tests of water — citizen sampling might be adequate. But, in Flint — where 
there's a major change in the system that some residents say have led to health problems, "it seems to be a much higher standard would apply," Kildee 
said. 

In addition to water testing, Wurfel a said state public health officials have reexamined results of blood-lead level testing among Flint children. In short, 
that data doesn't show the same upward trend that Hanna-Attisha's found, he said. 

Wurfel said environmental officials aren’t taking the matter lightly, and they realize the water system is in "dire" need of an overhaul. They've requested a 
meeting with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorities to "review protocols" to make sure the state's testing is adequate. 

"Lead is serious. Lead builds up. Lead effects children. It's not something we take lightly," he said. "We’re confident with what we’ve done, but we know 
there are concerns." 

Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, any increase in the past year in blood-lead levels among 
Flint children is attributed to predicable seasonal spikes. 

In the year preceding the change in the water system, 95 Flint children younger than 16, or 2,4% of those tested, had elevated blood-lead levels, 
according to state data. The following year, 123 children, or 3.2%, of those tested had elevated blood-lead levels. 

There is "cause for concern in Flint," but it cannot be attributed to the water, she said.

Lead' s toll (https://www.nlm.nih.aov/medlineplus/encv/article/002473.htrnt on children: 

Lead can affect many parts of the body, and is most harmful when there is repeated exposure, even to small amounts. Even low levels of lead exposure 
can harm a child's mental development, and the problems worsen as blood-fead levels get higher. 

The younger the child, the more harmful the exposure; unborn children are the most vulnerable, according to the National Institutes of Health, 

Among possible complications: 

* Behavior or attention problems 
» Failure at school 

* Hearing problems 

* Kidney damage 

* Reduced IQ 

* Slowed body growth 

Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, a staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.

t’s exhausting to know the resounding yawn that appears to 
have emanated .from the governor's workplace, foilowing 
information that an growing share of Flint children have been

provide, 

A spokeswoman for the Michigan Division of Weli being and

a chart she claimed would refute a report issued by a Hurtey 
Medical Heart researcher, who discovered that because the 
metropolis began pumping water from the Flint River final 
April, the share of Flint youngsters with elevated biood-iead 
ranges has greater than doubled in some ZIP codes. 

In reality, the state's information helps the Hurley researcher's 
declare — the variety of children with lead poisoning had been 
falling in Flint and throughout the state, till the water change. 

Now it is rising. 

A spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder wrote in an e-mail that

suggestion that it’s one thing apart from correct — though the

However here is the scenario: There's extra lead in Flint's 
water than there was. And extra Flint youngsters have lead of their blood, one thing that results in severe, 
irreversible behavioral and developmental issues.

The Metropolis of Flint determined in 2013 to affix the brand new Karegnondi Water Authority, together with 
Genesee, Sanilac and Lapeer counties. That system will not be full til! 2016. Within the interim, the town 
— below former emergency supervisor Darnell Earley — opted to pump its water from the Flint River, as a 
substitute of constant to buy it from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Division — partly, state officers say, as a 
result of DWSD deliberate to lift its charges for a brief-time period contract. Town thought-about mixing Lake 
Huron and Flint River water, however finally selected to tug water from the Flint River alone. Genesee County, 
in distinction, will proceed to buy its wafer from DWSD whereas the brand new system is below building.

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while switching waters I Statesman Tribune 

Researchers say Shat Flint River water, extra corrosive than the Lake Huron water pumped by the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Division, is leaching lead from the town's ageing infrastructure into the ’water provide. 

The town, and its residents, need assistance. Within the dose to time period, residents — particularly 
residents with formulation-fed infants, whose diets are composed virtually fully of water — residing in 
poverty want help to buy bottled water or filtration programs. And town wants to think about its lengthy-time 
period choices, particularly, whether or not to reconnect to DWSD till the Karegnondi system is full. 

That would not be a easy course of. Former Flint EM Darnell Earley, now EM for Detroit Public 
Colleges, wrote in an e-mailed assertion that he was not concerned within the determination to make use of 
river water, though it occurred throughout his tenure. He was additionally EM when a 9-mile part of pipe was 
bought to Genesee County, a call he wrote was within the works earlier than his appointment, which means 
the lown cannot reconnect to Ihe Detroit system with out the cooperation of Genesee County. 

Neither is the upper value of shopping for water from DWSD — about $1.5 million a month — within the 
metropolis’s price range, Flint Mayor Dayne Walling mentioned. The town, which emerged from state 
oversight this yr, would want the approval of its transitional advisory board to extend its water price range. 

Flint, by the way in which, is broke, 

U.S, Rep. Dan Kildee and state Senate Majority Chief Jim Ananich, each Flint Democrats, have pledged to 
deliver monetary and sensible help to the district. 

For now, Walling mentioned, Flint's water therapy plant will start so as to add anticorrosive brokers to the Flint 
River water, which can take weeks to affect the water provide. 

If I lived in Flint, I might be mad. If I had been a Flint mum or dad, with a little one who'd spent the final 12 
months and a half ingesting lead-contaminated water, I might be in despair. 

We’re speaking a few public weil being disaster — one that would have been prevented. 

Whose fault is it? 

Throughout their tenures, emergency managers are the iast word authority within the cities they serve. 

And so the accountability for Flint’s water ties, finally, with Snyder, and the emergency managers lie 
appointed — and it's Snyder who should come to Flint's rescue. Walling says Flint’s residents want funds for 
instant aid, however that the town wants grants to begin to improve its growing older, lead-ridden water 
infrastructure. 

Snyder hasn’t hesitated to nominate or retain emergency managers in struggling cities throughout the state, a 
stance the Free Press Editorial Board has largely supported, with one caveat: Emergency managers need to 
make issues higher. 

That's the premise on which the emergency supervisor legislation is based. Cities are the creation of the 
state. The state has a accountability to took after the well being and welfare of its residents, and typically, 
cities face challenges not fixable on the native degree, in these instances, the state should step in. 

That is actuaOy the case in Flint, which has suffered from the identical lack of inhabitants — and tax base 
— as Detroit, however with fewer property with which to leverage a passable consequence. 

In these circumstances, the Free Press editorial board has argued, the state has a accountability to behave, 
to revive some fiscal stability, and thus service supply and high quality of life for residents. 

That is the catch. 

It would be straightforward to stability any metropolis’s finances: Lay off all of the cops, promote aii of the 
ambulances, liquidate town parks. However that would not make life higher for residents. That is the 
steadiness emergency managers should be conscious of — value financial savings versus high quality of life. 

Spending cuts versus service supply. A metropolis's backside line cannot be revenue-pushed. 

That is the evident weak spot within the emergency supervisor legislation, and it on full show in Flint 

Snyder spokeswoman Sara Wurfe! stated the state signed off on the swap on the behest of Walling and the 
Flint Metropolis Council, and solely "with severe reservations.’’ 

That is not precisely how Walling remembers it. 

‘I didn't assist it come what may," he mentioned, "it wasn’t my resolution. I had lots of issues about it that t 
raised internally, however the funds was in place ... 1 had toads of considerations about it, however when it 
was determined that was the choice ... t didn't protest.”

High amount of lead found amid Flint children while switching waters j Statesman Tribune Page 3 of 4 

When the Flint Metropolis Council voted this 12 months to reconnect to the Detroit water system, then- 
emergency supervisor Jerry Ambrose known as its resolution “incomprehensible”: “Water from Detroit isn’t 
any safer than water from Flint," Ambrose stated, as reported within the Rint Journal. 


It is fairly clear that is not true. It isn't clear what anybody from the State of Michigan is ready to do about it 


Sixteen months in the past, Earley and Walling celebrated the town's departure from DWSD, elevating 
glasses of Flint River water, ready to toss them again, with a toast that strikes a hole word at present: Here is 
to Flint.

The Capitol Record Since 1906 


Volume #54, Report #195, Article #1 -Thursday, October 1, 2015 

Senate Activity Report | House Activity Report 


ressure Mounts On Flint Water; Snyder Prepares Actions 


A coalition of Flint and state organizations asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to 
order a switchover of the Flint water system with the Detroit Water and Sewerage system, in what is one of 
the most striking actions in the controversy. The demand came as state officials plan to announce a series of 
actions on Flint on Friday dealing with the water problems in the city. 


One legislator - who also complained he had been denied documents from the state dealing with the switch 
from the Detroit system to using water from the Flint River (a state official said the wrong documents had 
been requested) - said there had been a general discussion, but no specifics about what Mr. Snyder might 
announce. Rep. Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) said he expected the state would provide more filters to residents to 
help curb lead in the water. Filters will be helpful, Mr, Phelps said, but not enough. 


Governor Rick Snyder will not be at the event, to be held at Kettering University, but Flint Mayor Dayne 
Walling, along with Environmental Quality Director Dan Wyant . Health and Human Services Director Hick 
Lvon , Urban initiatives Director Harvey Hollins and the state's chief medical officer, Eden Wells, will speak on 
the initiatives being pursued. 

The presentation will be at 1:30 p.m.at the university's Innovation Center, 1300 Bluff Street. 

The controversy over the water in Flint has grown exponentially since indications that lead levels, caused 
mainly by antique pipes and their connections, were elevated in children who were tested. Researchers said 
they could not absolutely say the elevated levels were from the water, but the measures showed the increase 
since the city made the switch. Also on Thursday, it was announced that the city had received donations to 
provide some 5,000 water filters to help contain the lead. 

Prior to the discovery about elevated lead levels, the controversy over the system dealt largely with the smell 
and taste of the water. Flint switched from using Detroit water to drawing water from the Flint River in 2014 as 
the city prepared to build its own system that would draw water from Lake Huron. The switch was made 
largely because Flint and Detroit could not agree on a short-term contract to use the water, and the city, under 
a state-appointed emergency manager because of financial problems, did not want to pay the cost of Detroit 
water. 


In a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Snyder acknowledged that in making the switch, not all factors 
were probably considered. 

The request for the EPA to order both the city and state to make the switch to Detroit water came with a 
variety of city and state groups, including the Concerned Pastors for Social Action, the Flint Water Study 


http://www.gongwer.com/programming/prinierFrierKfly7emplate.cfm 


1/3 


10/9/2015 Gongwer News Service 

Team, the Michigan Nurses Association, the NAACP-Michigan State Conference, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and the Michigan branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, getting involved. 

The request charged that neither the state nor Flint were doing enough to fix the problem and urged that both 
be ordered to immediately have Flint's water system reconnected with the Detroit system, and that city 
residents be provided with a free source of water that meets ERA standards. 

Mr. Phelps, meanwhile, complained that the Department of Environmental Quality denied and the Department 
of Treasury ignored a Freedom of Information Act request for documents related to the city's switch from 
Detroit water to river water. Anytime there is a change in water systems of the course of water, the community 
has to apply to the state for that authority. 

But Brad Wurfel, with the DEQ, said Flint did not have to file that application because the city had always 
listed the Flint River as its back-up should it need it for a water supply. 

However, there are other documents that are available - to Mr, Phelps or anyone - dealing with the process the 
city and state took preparing for the switch, Mr. Wurfel said. 

Mr. Phelps said a DEQ official contacted him and said there were documents available and that they would be 
sent to him. The official asked that he drop his FOIA request, Mr. Phelps said. 

On the advice of his lawyers, Mr. Phelps said he did not drop the request. But he had also asked the 
department for any documents that might have to do with the switch. After his request was denied, he 
received several documents dealing with the system, but the documents were from 2007 and did not have to 
do with the switch. 

Mr. Phelps was surprised by the refusal and was planning what steps to next take. 

In terms of what the state should do to help in the situation, Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) 
told reporters after session on Thursday that he thought the state should first help with distributing filters to 
residents, especially those who may be most vulnerable, listing pregnant women, children, women that are 
nursing, those with immune system issues and the elderly among them. 

"That should be done immediately," Mr. Ananich said. "I think we need to have corrosion control put in place 
as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, I think we need some independent, outside testers to come in and 
develop the confidence level that's just not there with traditional people in place. And I think we need to have a 
serious look at reconnecting with Detroit. I think the state needs to help us find a new source of water." 

He said he would reserve judgment about how well the state has responded to the situation until after the 
administration makes its recommendations and remains unsure about any estimates on how much it might 
cost for Flint to reconnect to Detroit water. 

"There's been some negotiations going on at the local level, but I think it's important to get the real cost 
because it's a public health issue. And I'm hopeful we'll find that, i would hope that all folks, with an issue of 
this magnitude, would not try to gouge a community that's been suffering the way they are," Mr. Ananich said. 
"I think we need to all, at the state level, make sure people are negotiating in good faith." 

And Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof (R-West Olive) said he is unsure what the state's role should be 
in terms of helping Flint. The Senate did, on Thursday, include a $100 placeholder to deal with Flint's water

crisis in an appropriations supplemental it passed, but that was to keep the conversation going, Mr. Ananich 
said (see separate story). 

"I don't know that we really have a solution there yet,” Mr. Meekhof said after session. ''We could use 
revolving funds maybe, i don't think the city of Flint is in as bad of financial trouble as the city of Detroit, so if 
they need to bond for something, they would have assets with which to bond and maybe fix the problem. 
There's lots of options that are out there."

Regarding Phelps FOIA and proposed lawsuit, here are some things to know (Maggie, please jump in if I’ve 
got any of this wrong): 


1 . He filed on Sept. 4, and included a $50 personal check with a request focused on “waivers, permits or 
applications to use the Flint River as a drinking water source.” 

We didn’t have anything recent that matches that description. The river has been the city’s emergency 
backup for years, so they didn’t need a new formal approval, just approval of construction permits for 
the plant to begin serving as the primary water production source. We had some 2007 guidance 
documents we sent the city, and we shared those, but ultimately, there wasn’t much that matched his 
request. We responded piecemeal, on Sept. 22 and 25, with communications that we did not have 
records in Executive or Drinking Water division that matched his query. Our formal, final response 
came Sept. 30 th , denying the FOIA for lack of matching records (bit of a goof as we’d already sent the 
2007 guidance docs, but ... ). 


2. Maggie Datema called Phelps - to let him know he didn’t need to FOIA us, he could just ask and 
we’d supply whatever he wanted; to inform him we’d cancelled his check and were sending it back; 
and that we’d be happy to help him get whatever information he was seeking, as well as a meeting to 
better understand the program. Phelps reportedly told Maggie he needed to consult his attorney and 
he’d get back to us. He never did. 


3. Datema has called his office three times. No callback. 


4. The enclosed DRAFT communication will be completed and sent from Maggie to the representative 
today. 


Let me know what else you need. Thanks. 





Dear Representative Phelps 


1 apologize that recent attempts to connect with you via phone have not been 
successful. As I mentioned in our last phone conversation, I want to make sure you are 
provided complete access to the DEQ’s records and files to get answers to any question 
you have on Flint, or any other DEQ program. 

When the Department sent back your personal check included with your Sept. 4 
Freedom of Information Act request, it was because all state agencies make a practice 
of working directly with the state’s elected leaders to produce information and answer 
questions. The documentation we sent to you on Sept. 30 was the best available 
response to your query, based on the wording of the request for “waivers, permits or 
applications to use the Flint River as a source for water or drinking water ...” The 
subsequent communication from the DEQ FOIA officer was that office’s procedural 
closing of the loop. 

We would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you, more clearly explain the DEQ’s 
Drinking Water Program policies and requirements, and help you develop questions or 
requests for information we can respond to. You have our standing commitment to 
provide you with whatever information we have to help you in your role as a community 
leader. 

Please contact my office at the number below and we will arrange a meeting at any time 
that works for you. 

Sincerely, 

Maggie Datema 

Deputy Director, 


DEQ

DRAFT (517)241-2112 


MDHHS releases new report outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care , case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint children and adults. The report is intended to inform residents 
about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and provide cumulative total numbers. 

“With the progress that we’ve made in testing and identifying those with elevated blood lead 
levels, the Department will continue to work closely with the Genesee County Health 
Department to reach these families and conduct case management to reduce their exposure to 
lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive with the MDHHS. “We will update 
these numbers on a regular basis and remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

Between October 1 and October 30 of this year, there were 963 people tested in Flint. Of those 
children tested, 18 children 17 years of age or younger had elevated blood lead levels. Six adults 
over the age of 1 8 were identified with elevated blood lead levels during this same timeframe. 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of 
elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary 
and venous blood tests. People who have had multiple tests are counted only once. The full 
report is posted online at www.michigan.gov/flintwater and will be updated as more data 
becomes available. 


Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the Genesee County Health Department and local 
partners to distribute educational resources and informational letter to Flint parents regarding 
lead testing. GCHD nursing staff are conducting direct outreach to families when an elevated 
blood lead level has been detected, serving as an important resources by addressing questions 
and concerns, providing information, and meeting them in their home environment. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations including the MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of distribution, visit 

www.michigan.gov/flintwater . 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional on the MDHHS YouTube channel . For 
additional updates on Flint water including updates on blood lead levels and testing results, visit

Hi Marc, 


Our office was closed for Veterans Day yesterday, so I wasn’t able to have a FOIA invoice prepared for FOIA 
0367-16 until today (see attached PDFs for your records). Please note that a FOIA invoice is prepared for 
each FOIA response, so if you have any future FOIA requests, you’ll need to wait to make a payment until you 
receive the applicable invoice to avoid confusion in our Cashier’s Office about why you paid more than the 
invoiced amount. 


In this case, I spoke with our Cashier’s Office this morning about your payment for two FOIAs using one 
invoice, so I’m working it out with them to ensure they credit you with payment for both invoices. 


As before, when the Cashier’s Office confirms payment, the records will be e-mailed to you. Please let me 
know if you have any questions. Thanks.

DEQ Director Dan Wyant today made the following statement as he announced DEQ Chief 
Deputy Jim Sygo will immediately assume the role of interim chief of the department's Office 
of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance: 

"It recently has become clear that our drinking water program staff made a mistake while working with 
the City of Flint. Simply stated, staff employed a federal protocol they believed was appropriate, and it 
was not. The water testing steps followed would have been correct for a city less than 50,000 people, 
but not for a city of nearly 100,000. 

As details of the situation emerge, I am convinced our program staff believed they were doing their 
job right. As the state recognized there could be a health threat to Flint residents, we took appropriate 
steps. We are now embarked on an unprecedented effort to safeguard Flint residents and families 
with near-term, intermediate and long-term actions to protect and educate city residents. 

The issue in DEQ is experience and protocol with respect to corrosion control. The Governor has 
called for an independent, third-party after-action review. I have taken the step of changing leadership 
in the division. We are working with our federal partners and committed to being part of the U.S. 

EPA’s effort to strengthen its Lead and Copper rule. 

All who brought this issue to the department deserve credit for bringing it forward. Lead is a serious 
issue, particularly for young people, and we take it seriously. The Governor’s plan incorporates the 
suggestions outlined by the EPA and researchers at Virginia Tech. 

We will learn from this. We will make necessary changes to see to it that our program becomes a 
national leader in public health protection.”

KEY MESSAGES: 


1. it is increasingly clear through internal review at DEQ that staff overseeing drinking water 
mistakenly applied the wrong federal protocol when the city of Flint switched to the Flint River. 

2. Today’s announcement of new leadership in that division aligns with the states goal: make sure the 
public health is protected in Flint and elsewhere in the state, and ensure we learn from this so it never 
happens again. 

3. The governor's action plan continues to protect kids and families in Flint, with the switch back to 
Detroit water last week, free water filtration for all city residents, and inspection of ail Flint schools for 
lead exposure. 

4. Flint families who are concerned are encouraged to take advantage of free home water testing 
through the city and blood lead level testing for children.

Michigan DEQ vows changes in Flint water crisis 

Michigan DEQ vows changes in Flint water crisis 

Jim Lynch , The Detroit News 8:31 p.m. EDT October 19, 2015

News) 


Michigan’s top environmental official acknowledged the sjate made mistakes in its handling of Flint's long- 
running water crisis, and said changes would be made, including reassigning a top official responsible for the 
safety of drinking water, 

Dan Wyant, director of Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality, said late Sunday that staff members 
applied the wrong standards of the Lead and Copper Rule that governs testing and monitoring for drinking 
water. The result was that proper controls regarding corrosion were not put in place when the city began 
drawing its water from the Flint River in spring 2014. 


“Our actions reflected inexperience, and our public response to criticism was the wrong tone early in this 
conversation,’ Wyant said. “But the best we can do with the situation going forward is represented in our present course. ... We wiil learn from this. We 
will make necessary changes to see to it that our program becomes a national leader in (lead) protection.” 


The changes will include the reassignment of Ltane Shekter Smith, chief of DEQ’s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance. Gov. Rick Snyder 
will also introduce an independent, third-party review of the state’s handling of Flint's water issues. 

Wyant’s announcement comes after months of rising concerns among Flint residents over the safety of their drinking water and lead contamination, it 
also comes after the recent release of inter-agency communications relating to Flint's situation that demonstrate confusion behind the scenes. 

State officials seemingly failed to heed repeated warnings from the Environmental Protection Agency as far back as February about potential problems 
with Flint's water system. 


Communications released this week between the federal agency and DEQ also show how an environmental law designed to protect (he public allowed 
the government to utilize questionable water testing practices and move slowly in addressing problems, all while remaining “in compliance” with 
regulations. 

Critics hold the state responsible for the current situation, since Snyder's appointed emergency manager was in charge when the decision was made to 
begin drawing water from the Flint River in 2014 to save money. State officials have said that move was a “city decision.” 

Problems began then, including residents saying tap water had strange coloring, smelt and taste. In the last month, those concerns were dramatically 
heightened by studies that show lead levels in some children have risen since the switch from Detroit's water system. Those studies showed that, in 
some areas, lead levels in children’s blood samples have doubled and, in two ZIP codes, tripled. 

Many opportunities missed 

Emails and tetters released by the state this week show many missed opportunities for health and environmental agencies to identify the lead problems 
months ago. 

In February, an EPA official assessing Flint’s situation raised several concerns with DEQ, particularly with the way the state conducted testing to ensure 
water coming into city homes was safe to drink. Such testing is required by the federal Lead and Copper Rule. 

“Particulate lead release is a normal part of the corrosion process and it is universal (common) in all systems,” wrote Miguel Del Toral, regulations 
manager for EPA’s Region 5, in a Feb. 27 email to two DEQ staffers. 

“It's just that it’s not captured as often by the Infrequent (Lead and Copper Rule) sampling. If systems are pre-flushing the tap the night before collecting 
... samples ... (MDEQ still provides these instructions to public water systems) this clears particulate iead out of the plumbing and biases the results low 
by eliminating the highest lead values. ... 


“The particulate iead is being flushed away before collecting compliance samples which provides false assurance to resident about the true lead levels in 
the water," 


Del Toral would repeat the same concerns in a widely publicized unofficial memo in Aprii. But at each step along the way, city and officials responded to 
testing queries by saying their approach met federal guidelines. As recently as Sept. 3, Flint's Public Works Director Howard Croft supported the testing 
methods used.

, we nave penormea over one nunareo ana sixty teaa tests tnrougnout me city since switcning over to me i-nnt Kiver ana remain witn tne tKA 
standards,” he wrote. “It is also worth noting ... there are different lead testing methods used within the industry and the city remains consistent with the 
most recent EPA approved testing method which can produce different results than other methods.” 

Corrosion control lacking 

At the same time Dei Toral expressed concerns with Michigan’s testing methods, EPA officials also identified another major potential problem with Flint's 
water system: corrosion control Under the Lead and Copper Rule, Flint was required to provide “optima! corrosion control” — water additives that 
prevent lead from old plumbing and service lines from leaching into the drinking water. 

Two February EPA emails to the DEQ released this week indicated the federal agency was perplexed by what appeared to be a lack of such controls in 
the Flint system. Responses from Michigan over the next several months indicate no such controls were in place. An April 24 email from one DEQ staffer 
stated bluntly: “Flint is currently not practicing any corrosion control treatment at the water plant." 

On Sunday, Wyant said staffers applied standards of the Lead and Copper Rule that were designed for populations below 50,000. Flint has a population 
of-roughly 100,000, which triggers a different set of criteria and includes performing two six-month testing programs of local water to determine proper 
porrosion controls. 

“None of the DEQ staff in this division had ever worked on a water source switch for a community of over 50,000 people, ’ he said. “It's increasingly clear 
there was confusion here, but it also is increasingly clear that DEQ staff believed they were using the proper federal protocol and they were not.” 

The emails released this week also raise questions about statements made by Wyant earlier this month at a news conference. When asked about what 
corrosion controls had been used since Flint began drawing its water from the river, Wyant indicated the system had been using lime. 

Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, whose research on Flint's water had directly challenged many of the state's assertions in recent months, said lime 
could actually increase the corrosivity of the water interacting with lead plumbing lines. Edwards made the original FOfA request and received the 
corresponding documents first. DEQ officials later released those documents to the media. 

Earlier this week, Wyant addressed his statement about lime in a written response to questions. 

“I was relaying what staff and consultants have indicated to me," he said. "Lime softening was used to address the hardness of the water. Whiie this has 
an impact on pH, testing bore out that more needed to be done.” 

State, EPA officials disagree 

State environmental officials and their EPA counterparts apparently disagreed over the corrosion control issue for much of this year. Once Dei Toral's 
concerns were raised in February, a DEQ official explained why the state had not accounted for corrosion. 

Documents released this week include notes from a July meeting between the parties where the state highlighted its reasoning: “MDEQ explained that 
they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a 'new system,’ but as a new source. It is their understanding that two rounds of six-month testing is 
still needed to characterize the water quality. They don’t know what optimized is until those two rounds of six-month monitoring are completed." 

Emails from this spring show MDEQ officials eventually recognized the need fof additional corrosion control measures, yet little progress was made on 
the issue — right up until Friday's announcement that Flint had switched back to getting its water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. 

That type of pacing is completely permissible under the Lead and Copper Rule. Busch, of the DEQ, described the schedule laid out by the federal law. 

“They now have to complete a study (within IS months) and are then allowed a period of additional time (2 additional years) to install the selected 
treatment for fully optimized corrosion control,” Busch wrote in July. "We are planning to suggest the city direcity submit a treatment process to shorten 
the time-line to achieve full optimization. This letter is currently being drafted but won’t be ready to mail out for another week.”

Brad: 

The statement from Dan Wyant includes this: 

The Governor has called for an independent, third-party after-action review. 

Questions: 

Who/what is the third party? 
is it the legislature? 

A committee of experts to be appointed? 

Senate Minority leader (from Flint) wants legislative review. Is that something the 
state is prepared to assist with? 

Please let me know asap.

Rep. Phelps Files Suit Against State of 
Michigan, City of Flint 

State , city failed to release documents sought in FOIA request 

LANSING — State Representative Phil Phelps (D-Flushing) announced earlier today that 
he is filing suit against the state of Michigan and the city of Flint to force them to release 
public documents he requested last month under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 


3 




"It's an absolute shame that I have to file suit to force our government to comply with 
the law/ Phelps said. "I was shocked at their response, because prior to receiving the denials, 
officials from both the city and state had told me that not only did documents exist, but they 
would be happy to share them with me." 

On Sept. 4 of this year, Phelps requested that the city and state turn over all documents 
and emails regarding the permit and application process that Flint's emergency manager was 
required to complete before the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality gave the go 
ahead to the city to start using the Flint River as its source of drinking water. Late last month, 
the state and the city both denied Phelps' request, saying that no such documents exist. 

In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also quoted in 
several articles on Mlive.com, making comments about the permit application process for Flint 
to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit's system to the Flint River. 

"I want to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality of the river water 
before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent actions, it almost seems 
they knew a lot more than they are letting on to," Phelps said. "Flint residents deserve better 
than this, they deserve to know the truth about the decisions that were made, and if I have to 
fight this in court to get the truth, so be it."

Gov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides 
best protection for public health in Flint 

State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch 

FLINT, Mich. - Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water 
Authority as the source of the city’s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said. 

Snyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to 
reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott 
Foundation donating $4 million. 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today 
also committed an additional $3.5 million for water fitters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint 
water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water. 

Flint city leaders requested the state’s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint’s 
Technical Advisory Committee. Flint’s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 
million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer. 

“All Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water,” Snyder said. "The technical experts helping the city on its 
water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health 
protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem, 

I appreciate Detroit’s willingness to reconnect with Flint, the Mott Foundation’s generous donation, and the 
dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.” 

The move to Detroit water, which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large 
bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff 
issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally, the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully 
optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from 
leaching into the water. 

However, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city's problem with lead service lines 
or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 
Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and 
plumbing are replaced. 

To best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on 
Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing 
residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water. 

Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office 
locations. 

For residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the 
Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in 
Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and 
assist residents who have questions about proper installation. 

At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday 
and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, 


6 



Other good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the 
water until it’s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing 
baby formula. 

School test results released; more investigation planned 

The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 
total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level 
of 15 parts per billion. 

However, this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and 
inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled 
water and filtration as a precaution to protect children. 

In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free 
testing is also available for any Flint resident. 

Additional information, including more detailed lead screening results, is available at 
www.michigan.gov/flintwater .

in short, I believe the answer I’m going to be able to confirm yet today is that the schools have never

There is no requirement in statute for the testing of schools for lead or copper if they’re using the 
municipal service as their supply (statute presumes they are covered same as homes by the 
surveillance monitoring done on households). 

If the school is on its own well, it undergoes testing as a sole source,

Reviewing my notes, Tm not sure I got a definitive answer from Wyant about

Was corrosion control in use? I'd like a simple yes or no, here - if no, obviously, 
why not - if yes, what was it, and why was - if any - what sounds like a lesser 
degree of corrosion control being used? 1 would like the names of the specific 
technologies/chemicals that were in use in the past, if in fact corrosion control 
was being used at the Flint piant, and the specific technologies that will be used 
going forward. 

Was the MDEQ unaware that there were aging lead service lines in Flint, and 
that those would increase the lead risk? Were the Flint water treatment folks? 
Why was this not taken into account in developing the water treatment plan? 
Wyant said that "two consecutive back to back tests" showed there was a 
problem; when were those tests performed and when were the results 
available? 

Obviously 1 would like to use this information in a piece we'll have ready to go at l:30p 
so ASAP would be great.

Sara or Dave, 

Quick follow-up question: In reference to the plan to immediately test water coming out of the faucets 
of all schools in Flint Community Schools, will the water at Flint's public charter schools be tested as 
well? i don't have an exact count, but I'm guessing there are a half-dozen or more charter schools in 
Flint.

Hi ail - 

Per conversations today, here are the details for Friday's embargoed media conference call. 

Given some of the changing information, we added in a quick pre-brief with the Governor from 11 to 11:10 a.m. to give 
us a chance to go over any last details and finalize flow. This will be followed by the actual media conf. call from 11:15 to 
11:40 a.m. Know that folks will be needing to head to Flint immediately afterward. 

Sounds like we'll have Dan, Nick and Dr. Wells in person. That's great and will work best when most everyone is in the 
same room. The location is Romney Building, 1 st floor communications conference room. The governor will be joining us 
from phone. 

We'll need to be fairly quick in overview and framing comments so we can get to as many Qs as possible. 

Please let me know if anyone has any Qs, concerns or needs anything else at all. Or if you'd like a listen only line for 
anyone back in the depts. to catch the call. 

Otherwise, see you in the Romney by 11 a.m. tomorrow. 

Thanks so much!

Hi all - attached are the Gov's edits to the order of items in the action plan. 

I know we had a robust discussion about these today and everyone felt pretty deliberative and flowed, but 
please review and let us know if anyone has any major heartburn. Otherwise, this is what will go with and 
change news release to match. TPs can probably stay in order originally for press conference to maintain flow 
of Dan, Nick, et al. 

These have to be to printer by 7 am tomorrow am in order to get done in time for press conference. 

Thx much,

RE: Hey 


We got contacted as well. 

What planning on saying is that this issue is one that we've been actively engaged on and our administration will be 
outlining a collaborative, comprehensive action plan tomorrow afternoon. We believe protecting public health is 
paramount and safe, clean, accessible drinking water is essential . That's what we are focused on helping ensure and 
working together across local, state and federal levels to bring all resources and ideas to bear. 

Will add that the governor and state agencies have been closely working with Flint leaders on their infrastructure 
challenges, including providing $4.2 million in grants and restructured loan financing to provide resources needed to 
locate and fix infrastructure problems and add the carbon filtration system, additional testing and helping identify and 
provide filters.

GROUPS PETITION EPA FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO 


FLINT, Ml DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION 

City and state agencies have failed to fix the public health crisis that imperils children’s health 

CHICAGO {October 1 , 2015) - in response to the ongoing drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, a coaiition of local 
citizens and national groups petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today to take emergency action to 
secure safe, iead-free water for the City’s children and families, 

Flint-based Coalition for Clean Water, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, and the Natural Resources Defense 
Council joined the petition to trigger the EPA to launch a comprehensive federal response to the ongoing crisis. Under the 
Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA is empowered to stop “imminent and substantial endangerment to human health" such 
as the elevated lead levels in Flint's drinking water. 

The petition urges that EPA immediately order the City and Michigan DEG to reconnect Flint's water system with water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, and to provide Flint residents with an alternative, free source of safe 
drinking water that meets EPA standards, among other requests. 

“Neither the City of Flint nor the State of Michigan is doing enough to fix the problem of lead in our drinking water. As 
evidenced by the ongoing poisoning of the children of Flint, it's time for the EPA to take immediate action to provide us 
with a safe water source," said LeeAnne Walters, a concerned parent from Flint and member of the Water You Fighting 
For, one of the organizations petitioning the EPA. “The city and state need to test for lead and copper as intended by the 
federal lead and copper rule," Walters added. 

Highly corrosive water in the Flint River, the source of the City's drinking water, has been flowing through lead service 
lines in Flint’s water system for more than a year. A medical study has confirmed that the number of children living in Flint 
with health-threatening elevated blood lead levels has risen since the City switched its water source. One study of Flint 
children under age five found that the proportion of children living in Flint with elevated blood levels has doubled since the 
City changed its drinking water source. The statistics are worse for younger children; those under fifteen months old had 
lead levels elevated 2.5 times greater after the switch to Flint River water. 

The City of Flint and the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) have been made aware of tap water 
monitoring results showing shockingly high lead levels in homes served by the City's drinking water system for months, 
but neither has taken the action necessary to meaningfully address the problem. There also appear to be serious issues 
with how the City was testing for lead in a way that appears to downplay the extent of the problem. 

“Americans rightly believe that the water coming out of their taps should be safe, not exquisitely toxic. For more than a 
year, lead-contaminated drinking water has been flowing through Flint's pipes, faucets, and fountains. If the City and State 
will not address the issue, the EPA should step in to protect kids' health immediately,” said Henry Henderson, Midwest 
Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 

“Flint city officials, state-appointed emergency managers and the Michigan Department of Environmental Qualify have all 
failed monumentally in their duty to provide the people of Flint with clean, safe drinking water. Now that the truth is 
revealed, further action is imperative,” said Kary L. Moss, ACLU of Michigan executive director. “The devastating 
revelations from independent researchers, as well as our own nearly year-long investigation, demand an immediate, 
effective and comprehensive response. The EPA, aiong with and city officials, must exercise their full authority to 
guarantee that the people of Flint are protected from the hazardous water now flowing into their homes. The first step 
should be to overturn the emergency manager order and remove the Flint River as the city's source of water." 

There is no safe level of lead exposure. The toxic effects of lead on virtually every system in the body, and particularly on 
the developing brains of young children, are well documented. It can also contribute to high blood pressure and other 
health problems in adults. Even low levels of lead in the biood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and 
academic achievement, effects that are irreversible. 

Until Flint restores a safe drinking water source that meets EPA standards, residents are advised to take the following 
steps: 


27 



? Flush faucets by running water for a minimum of five (5) minutes prior to consumption; 

? Use only coid water from taps for drinking and cooking, as warm or hot water is more iikely to contain higher 

levels of lead; 

? install and use water filters that are certified to remove lead by NSF international (labeled as meeting “NSF 
Standard 53” for lead removal), and regularly change the filter cartridges; and 

? Use only filtered or bottled water to prepare baby formula and food. Children, pregnant or nursing women should 
also use filtered or bottled water for drinking and cooking. 

In addition, residents should consider taking the following additional steps where possible: 

? Remove and clean individual faucet aerators, as lead particles and sediment can collect in the aerator screen 
located at the faucets; 

? Contact a licensed plumber to replace any household plumbing that may contain lead; and 

? Flush cold water taps after installing any new household pipes or fixtures.

Hi Brad, 

Alii here with Michigan Radio - 1 help with booking for Stateside with Cynthia Canty . On 
today's show, we're speaking with Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards about Flint’s water problems. 

I would like to see if someone from the DEQ (Mike Prysby or Dan Wyant) would be interested 
in joining the conversation. 

The interview is at 11:35 am so I would need to know as soon as possible. 

Two main things we would like to discuss: how the city conducted testing for lead and why DEQ 
did not require Flint to put corrosion control in place at the time of the switch. 

The interview would be pre-recorded, not live, and would take about 10-15 minutes. A land line 
is preferred, 

When you have a moment, please let me know. 

Thanks!

Congressman Dan Kildee Calls For Additional "Independent and 
Scientific" Testing to Ensure Safety of Flint’s Water 

FLINT - Congressman Dan Kildee (MI-05) today, as part of his continued efforts 
to get answers regarding recent lead levels recorded in the city of Flint’s water 
system, met with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Lansing. 

The meeting followed a letter sent last week by Congressman Kildee posing 
various questions about recent lead levels in the water. In response to 
Congressman Kildee’s letter, the DEQ and EPA invited Congressman Kildee and 
other local, state and federal elected officials to attend today’s briefing in Lansing. 

After the meeting today, Congressman Kildee issued the following statement: 

“ After meeting with the EPA and DEQ, it is clear to me that immediate 
independent and scientific testing is necessary to determine the safety of Flint’s 
water. So far, the city, DEQ and EPA have not adequately answered my questions 
on their testing methods to ensure the safety of Flint ’s water. 

"So far, I have been given no reason to have confidence in the current testing 
results. For example, it is unclear if homes sampled also took part in previous 
tests, which could have shown trends in water quality. 

“I call on the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the city of Flint, to work 
together to conduct additional independent and scientific testing of Flint ’s water. 
Additional testing must be expanded from its current scope to include more 
homes. It must also factor in the most at-risk homes in Flint. 

“ Flint residents deserve absolute transparency when it comes to the quality of 
their water. Additionally the city, DEQ and EPA must work together to ensure the 

37 



immediate safety of Flint ’s drinking water, including any temporary relief until a 
long-term solution can be completed. ”

Subject: Reporter seeking a response to Virgnia Tech's Flint Water Study findings 

Importance: High 

Dear Mr, Wurfei, 

After testing more than 250 homes in Flint, researchers at Virginia Tech have continued to find 
dangerously high levels of lead in many of the homes being sampled. 

They are unequivocal in their findings, stating that: "Flint has a very serious lead in water 
problem." 

These results run contrary to the city and MDEQ's assertions that the city of Flint is in 
compliance with U.S. EPA Lead and Copper Rule compliance standards. In fact, based on 
Virginia Tech's results - which are much more extensive, having tested nearly four times as 
many homes as the city tested during the first half of 2015, and the VT researchers have not 
specifically target high-risk homes, as the city is required to do for the LCR monitoring -the city 
is actually well out of compliance. 

I was hoping you would be able to provide the MDEQ's position regarding VT researchers' 
purported findings, and the contradictory conclusions..

Virginia Tech's methodology and results have been posted on a web site dedicated to the 
project (flintwaterstudy.org/ ), so it is dear from their end how they have approached this project, 
and exactly what they've done, and what they've found. 

It would be very helpful to have the MDEQ's views on all this for my upcoming story. 

I am working on a deadline and would very much appreciate a response by the end of the day 
tomorrow, Sept. 11. 

I appreciate any help you can provide in my reporting on this very important public health 
issue. 

Sincerely, 

Curt

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

DRAFT (517)241-2112 


MDHHS releases October data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care , case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint children and adults. The department’s summary report shows 
that 24 of 963 adults and children tested in Flint had elevated levels. 


MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to reach out to families 
testing with higher levels and help them reduce their exposure to lead sources. The report is 
intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and provide cumulative 
total numbers. 


“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, chief 
medical executive with the MDHHS. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those 
with elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with county 
health department to reach these families. We will update these numbers on a regular basis and 
remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 963 children and adults between 
October 1 and October 30. Eighteen children age 17 or younger had elevated blood lead levels. 
Six adults over the age 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of 
elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary 
and venous blood tests. People who have had multiple tests are counted only once. The full 
report is posted online at www.michigan.gov/flintwater and will be updated as more data 
becomes available. 


The testing is part of the state’s action plan to address health concerns related to Flint’s water 
infrastructure. 


Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letter to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
The state provided supplemental funding to support GCHD nursing staff to conduct direct 
outreach to families when an elevated blood lead level has been detected. These nurses serve as 
an important resource by addressing questions and concerns, providing information, and meeting 
with families in their home environment.

Erin Brockovich highlights the Flint water 
fight 



Environmental activist Erin Brockovich took to Facebook on Tuesday to slam Michigan authorities 
regarding Flint's drinking water controversy — and offered a shoutout to Metro Times and 
contributor Curt Guyette for covering the issue. Brockovich posted a photo of Brad Wurfel, the 


i 



Communications Director at Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, captioning the image 
with a lengthy tirade calling Wurfel a "spin doctor" and "paid distorter of truth" for his role in 
downplaying a July EPA memo and ongoing investigation that revealed the presence of lead in Flint' 
drinking water supply. Brockovich then cited Metro Times contributor Curt Guyette's recent 
reporting on the issue, highlighting three times Wurfel had attempted to discredit or deny the 
ongoing investigations. 




Good People of Flint, Michigan... and all of Michigan. 

This is the face of the Spin Doctor. Disgusting and shameful. A paid distorter of 
TRUTH!

PRESS RELEASE: Emergency Manager Transition Update to City Council 

EM Update to City Council April, 2015.PDF; EM Transition Update Release 4.13.15.pdf 


For Immediate Release 


EM Updates Council, Requests support for Emergency Loan and District Court 
Consolidation; Adjusts Salaries for Mayor and Council 


Flint, Michigan -April 13, 2015 - By letter to City Council issued today, Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose 
congratulated City Council for their recent actions committing to restoring and maintaining the City’s financial 
solvency. Mr. Ambrose stated that recent actions to adopt a series of ordinances requiring commitment to 
establishing appropriate financial reserves and an improved planning and budgeting process indicate that the 
Council understands the need to restore and maintain Flint’s financial solvency. “While there is much yet to do, 
these are positive steps in the right direction,” said Mr. Ambrose. “The ongoing challenge will be to adhere to 
the requirements the City Council has adopted themselves.” 

Mr. Ambrose’s letter also reiterated the priority issues currently facing the City - developing a long range 
financial plan, beginning with the upcoming FY16 and FY17 budget; continuing to address concerns with water 
safety, quality and affordability; and stabilizing resources for public safety. “These are clearly the top priority 
issues, and ones which require the cooperation of all if they are to be successfully addressed,” stated Mr. 
Ambrose. “Unfortunately, resources are extremely limited, and we must make decisions which address the most 
critical issues in a financially sound manner - and that often means we cannot do everything everybody wants.” 


Some of the ingredients of restoring Flint’s financial solvency on a sustainable basis, according to Mr. 
Ambrose, include obtaining a $7 million loan to finance the accumulated General Fund deficit and approving 
the consolidation of the 67th and 68th District Courts. Both issues are pending before City Council and Mr. 
Ambrose is hopeful for a quick positive response. “The terms and conditions offered with this loan equate to a 
good deal for the City and will enable it to begin to more quickly rebuild its financial solvency. Approving the 
court consolidation will reduce City expenses by $8.4 million over the next 10 years and will help to provide 
some stability in funding other public safety services.” 

Mr. Ambrose also presented Council with actions he is taking to continue the progress towards transition, 
including an updated purchasing ordinance and an order officially defining the role of the new City 


l 



Administrator as the chief administrative officer for the City. “Moving the City forward in today’s environment 
requires professional managers, clear responsibilities, and modern practices,” said Ambrose. “These actions 
move in that direction, and hopefully move the Council forward in truly becoming the governing body of the 
City, focused on policies and accountability for moving the City forward based on its vision, mission, and 
goals.” 

Recognizing the increasing role of the Mayor and Council as the City transitions to home rule with oversight by 
a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Mr. Ambrose announced that he is reestablishing the salaries for 
Mayor and Council at the levels in place before the City was most recently placed into state receivership. He 
noted that Council meetings are now held twice per month, with committee meetings held once per month, and 
the Mayor is now much more engaged in a Chief Executive role. Continued receipt of the re-established 
salaries, however, will be contingent upon attainment of certain training levels. These training levels were 
established in prior orders of the Emergency Manager, and Councilmembers will have until November 1, 2015 
to obtain it, or their salary will be reduced to the current level.

Much progress has been made in preparing for the transition, including action by the City Council 
to complete the following: 

• Final adoption of the Capital Improvements Plan 

• Final adoption of ordinances regarding planning, budgeting, funds balance, and deficit 
elimination 

• Update of the Strategic Plan’s Vison, Mission, and Goals 

• Adoption of budget priorities to guide development of the F Y1 6/F Y 1 7 budget 

Additionally, our new City Administrator Natasha Henderson is on board and is assuming duties 
as the experienced and professionally trained chief administrative officer for the City. 

There are several issues which we are continuing to address, including: 

• Water safety, quality, and affordability continues to be a top priority. The City’s water 
supply today is safe, as measured by the same MDEQ standards that have been in place for 
years, and steps are being taken to improve treatment and distribution processes in order to 
address issues of discoloration and odor, and to assure continued safety. Reviews of our 
pricing structure are also underway to assure that customers are treated equitably while 
generating sufficient revenue to operate the system. 

Public safety continues to be an area of critical concern. The independent study of our 
police and fire organization provided a number of recommendations focused on how to 
best deploy the resources we have, and also confirmed that the staffing levels afforded by 
our limited resources are extremely low in comparison to comparable municipalities. 

This emphasizes the critical continuing importance of renewing the two voter-approved 
public safety millages and working to assure continuing state support through the 
assignment of state troopers and through financial support of the City lock-up. Loss of 
any of this support would be a disaster for the City. 

• Achieving and then maintaining financial stability will continue to require constant 
attention. Approval of the ordinances regarding financial stability and the anticipated 
approval of the $7 million loan provide additional tools with which to work. Attention will 
need to be paid to not only developing and adopting budgets for FY16 and FY17 but doing 
so in the context of understanding the impact of those budgetary decisions into the 
following three years. Essential to this is making the budget decisions which truly address 
achievement of the stated vison, mission and goals for the City as adopted by the City 
Council. Unfortunately, the challenges in doing so will be great, as the City will continue 
to be faced with the reality of a structural deficit, where for the foreseeable future current 
expenditure patterns exceed revenue streams - a difficult position, given the City’s already 
low level of services. Complicating this further is the potential impact of the retiree health 
care lawsuit, once the final outcome is decided.

• Finally progress continues with modernizing the operations of the City and setting the 
framework for future development. With the Master Plan and Capital Improvement Plan 
in place, focus is now turning to implementation, including updating the Zoning Ordinance. 

As we move forward with preparing for transition, there is much work yet to do. Today I am taking 
three actions consistent with our path: 

• Adoption of an updated purchasing policy - 1 am enacting the revisions to the Purchasing 
policy which were reviewed by Council within the past few months. These changes are 
made with the goal of assuring that the process of obtaining goods and services is consistent 
with the expectations of the Strategic Plan. There must be proper oversight and 
transparency, with a goal of obtaining goods and services that best meet the needs of City 
departments. The process must ensure competitive procurement, conducted in a timely and 
ethical manner. The City Council has an. important role in assuring compliance with the 
policy, which is not the same as conducting purchasing operations. 

• Confirming the role of the City Administrator - Before the search for a new City 
Administrator was begun, it was determined, within the context of the Seven Point 
Transition Plan, that an experienced and professional City Administrator would be selected 
on the basis of an open competitive process, and that the duties of the City Administrator 
would be structured in a manner which assures the ability to manage and direct the 
administrative affairs of the City in a professional manner. While those duties and 
expectations were described in the job description of the City Administrator and in 
recruitment materials, I am now formally enacting them in Emergency Manager Order 
Number 3. 

• Re-establishing salaries for Mayor and Council - As we are moving towards transition, the 
duties and responsibilities of the Mayor and City Council are expanding towards the 
traditional roles of a City operating under home rule. Council meetings are now held twice 
per month, with committee meetings held once per month. The Mayor is now much more 
engaged in a Chief Executive role. Consequently, I have determined to re-establish the 
salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place immediately prior to the appointment 
of an Emergency Manager in November, 2011. Continued receipt of the re-established 
salaries, however, is contingent upon attainment of certain training. The re-established 
levels, and the contingency regarding training, is found in Emergency Manager Order 
Number 4. 

Over the next several weeks, there will be much work with respect to finalizing the loan application 
and developing the FY16 and FY17 budgets along with FY18, FY19, and FY20 projections. Work 
will also continue with implementing improvements of the water system, and reviewing our 
associated rate structure. Evaluation and implementation of the recommendations for best use of 



Flint City Council 
April 13, 2015

police and fire resources will continue, including corrective action for the police evidence room 
issues. Summer street maintenance and repair programs, as well as sidewalk repairs will soon be 
underway. Public meetings regarding the zoning ordinance are being held, with a recommended 
updated ordinance expected for consideration in late spring. A revision to the City’s business 
licensing ordinance is expected soon. These are but a few of the many activities to be expected as 
the City makes the best use of its resources to provide the best level of service it can within the 
resources it has. 

I look forward to working with you as we move towards transition to home rule under the guidance 
of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Ambrose. “Unfortunately, resources are extremely limited, and we must make decisions 
which address the most critical issues in a financially sound manner - and that often 
means we cannot do everything everybody wants.” 

Some of the ingredients of restoring Flint’s financial solvency on a sustainable basis, 

according to Mr. Ambrose, include obtaining a $7 million loan to finance the accumulated

General Fund deficit and approving the consolidation of the 67th and 68th District Courts. 
Both issues are pending before City Council and Mr. Ambrose is hopeful for a quick 
positive response. “The terms and conditions offered with this loan equate to a good deal 
for the City and will enable it to begin to more quickly rebuild its financial solvency. 
Approving the court consolidation will reduce City expenses by $8.4 million over the next 
10 years and will help to provide some stability in funding other public safety services.” 

Mr. Ambrose also presented Council with actions he is taking to continue the progress 
towards transition, including an updated purchasing ordinance and an order officially 
defining the role of the new City Administrator as the chief administrative officer for the 
City. “Moving the City forward in today’s environment requires professional managers, 
clear responsibilities, and modern practices,” said Ambrose. “These actions move in that 
direction, and hopefully move the Council forward in truly becoming the governing body 
of the City, focused on policies and accountability for moving the City forward based on 
its vision, mission, and goals.” 

Recognizing the increasing role of the Mayor and Council as the City transitions to home 
rule with oversight by a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Mr. Ambrose announced 
that he is reestablishing the salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place before 
the City was most recently placed into state receivership. He noted that Council meetings 
are now held twice per month, with committee meetings held once per month, and the 
Mayor is now much more engaged in a Chief Executive role. Continued receipt of the re- 
established salaries, however, will be contingent upon attainment of certain training 
levels. These training levels were established in prior orders of the Emergency Manager, 
and Council members will have until November 1 , 2015 to obtain it, or their salary will be 
reduced to the current level.

State of the City 2015 
Flint's Rebirth 


I. Introduction & Acknowledgements 

Good afternoon. I thank each and every one of you in attendance. 

I want to start by going back to just over a year ago to this same place. In last 
year's State of the City address I ended by stating that the end to our Valley Forge 
winter was inevitable, that the snow would melt, that a new season would come. 
Now I stand before you today to announce Flint's rebirth with the same certainty 
of last year's forecast of change. 

Let me thank and recognize a number of people who are here today. 

Thank you to City Council President, City Council members and City Clerk for 
hosting. The color guard for the glorious display of pride and patriotism. 

I am personally so grateful for my family's support and understanding... 

I thank Rev. Tillman for the invocation. First Trinity is one of the crown jewels of 
our community and just a block over from our City Hall. I am thankful that God 
brought Rev. Tillman and his family into our Flint family and that he accepted the 
invitation to be here this afternoon. Thank you for your service Rev. Tillman. And 
also thank you to Rabbi Companez who will provide the benediction. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

I want to recognize all of the pastors and faith leaders who are here today. Please 
stand and let us recognize you for your leadership. 

We also have a number of our elected officials who have joined us here today. 
Please stand so I can recognize each of you. Thank you. 

I also want to recognize all of the City of Flint officials and employees who have 
taken time to be here this afternoon. Thank you to you as well. 


This truly is the beginning of a new chapter for Flint: a new birth. 

I believe with all my heart that Flint is ready for this change. I thank everyone who 
has stood by us and stayed with us through this difficult recovery and 
receivership. 

There have been many days of confusion and nights of anguish. I have used ail of 
that to fuel my determination to get to the threshold to where we stand today. I 

have been extremely frustrated but I have used that as motivation to work harder 
and smarter, to get more done and to get to this point as quickly as humanely 
possible given the situation. Now, we are here, this is our time, and we are 
prepared to take full responsibility for rebuilding this great American city for its 
new life in the 21 st Century. 

Many in Flint have been hard at working, laboring to bring about the necessary 
changes in order for us to flourish after the long decline. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

We have prayed 
on the truth of our faith: 
they that sow in tears 
shall reap in joy. 


Today, there are signs of rebirth all over the community and in every city 
department. This afternoon we are going to take a look at many of these signs of 
rebirth and the challenges that remain in front of us as we nurture further 
growth, development, democracy and opportunity. 

Let's start right here on the third floor with the Flint City Council. The Flint City 
Council has cemented the recent financial success of the City. Newly enacted 
ordinances, policies and procedures all in accordance with the voter mandated 
charter amendments in the fall of 2014 provide a path for the City of Flint to 
move forward in achieving and maintaining sustainable financial solvency. The 
financial emergency is over. The Council President Joshua Freeman and Finance 
Committee Chairperson Monica Galloway are to be commended for their able 
leadership. 


Going to the second floor in the Finance Department. The Deficit is eliminated ! 
[that's an applause line, the deficit is eliminated!] 

The City of Flint is in a positive financial position for the first time in a decade. 
Budget amendments are being done in a timely fashion. The biennial budget has 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


3 



been adopted. The budget is stronger and the City's risks going forward are 
fewer. The City has seen a decline in lawsuits and that has resulted dramatically 
smaller funding for lawsuits and settlements than has been seen for a 
decade. Kudos to the entire administration especially Deputy Director Dawn 
Steele who was promoted from Receivables Administrator to Deputy Finance 
Director just a few months ago. She is a long term city employee and resident, she 
accepted the challenge and made it happen. ..it is Ms. Steele and others like her 
who will go the extra mile that will make the city succeed! 

Related to financial management, going forward, there is a new Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board that has been put in place. Thanks to Governor for 
expressing trust and understanding the need to get Flint back to local control. 
Working together, separate from partisan interests, we now have a strong board 
with experienced professionals who are also upstanding citizens. 

I want to recognize and introduce the board members: 

Fred Headen, Chief Legal Counsel at the State Department of Treasury 

Brian Larkin, with the Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce 

David Maghee, now with the Skiilman Foundation 

Dr. Beverly Walker-Griffea, President of Mott Community College 

Dr. Robert McMahan, President of Kettering University 

I look forward to working with the board to continue Flint's financial stability. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

And there is a new Charter Commission to look at the entire structure of 
government, I want to congratulate and recognize the Flint Charter 
Commissioners. 

John D. Cherry, Brian Larkin, Cleora Magee, Victoria McKenze, Charles Metcalfe, 
Heidi Phaneuf, James Richardson, Marsha Wesley, and Barry Williams. 

The Law Department has funding in place this budget year so the Charter 
Commission can hit the ground running. It is my hope that the Charter 
Commission completely engage the community and also takes full advantage of 
the resources available in Michigan around local government and best practices. 

Increasing Public Safety 

Let's move from City down Fifth St. to the Fire Department and the Police 
Department. 


Flint's Firefighters have been hard at work but thankfully the number of fire 
incidents are down 20% from last year year-to-date. With his experience in fire 
prevention, Chief Cox has made public education and community outreach a 
major objective. Next week, Firefighters will again take to the streets and begin 
knocking on doors in the community to discuss with citizens the importance of 
fire safety and smoke detectors and the Arson Reward Program. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


5 



The Arson Tip Line is 1-800-44-ARSON or I -800-442-7766. Brochures and survey 
cards will also be handed out and those are available on the resource table as you 
leave. 

All of this work is getting done while the reorganization of the Flint Fire 
Department is still underway. Nevertheless, the department is on track to further 
reduce overtime. In cooperation with the new Local 352 contract which went into 
effect in February there will be more efficient management of the Flint Fire 
Department and I want to personally thank every member of the team who has 
made this possible. 

Over the past year the Flint Police Department has engaged the community and 
youth, decreased crime, reduced response time, applied new technology and 
reformed policies. Police officers and leadership are attending community 
meetings every month. Overall Part 1 crime including homicides, robbery, 
burglary is down 9% overall. 

Laws are being updated and enforced. Over 100 nuisance and criminal ordinances 
have been updated, correcting outdated language and ensuring our local laws are 
fully consistent with state and federal law. 

Technology has been applied to improve the functionality of the Department 
including starting a social media presence, selecting a new records management 
system, transferring 911 to the regional consortium. The adoption of tasers has 
resulted in a 90% reduction in prisoner and officer injuries. Over $250,000 in the 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

new budget is also is set to be invested into public safety facilities to improve the 
working conditions for our men and women in uniform. This represents the first 
improvement of this nature in years and is in line with the adopted capital 
improvement facilities plan. 

Most importantly, the Flint Police Department is taking new steps to engage with 
the community and youth. The University Avenue corridor initiative is underway 
to better connect neighborhoods and students with public safety strategies 
through a million dollar grant from the US Department of Justice. A new 
Neighborhood Service Center or police mini-station will be opening next week at 
the Dort Mall. The grand opening is scheduled for Monday, May 11 th at 1pm. 
Another new station will come later this year and improvements will be made at 
the existing sites. Two listening sessions with youth are being scheduled before 
the school year is out at both Southwestern and Northwestern on May 11 th and 
Mayl2th respectively. It is important that we take time to understand the 
perspectives and concerns of our young people and I applaud Chief Tolbert and 
our School Resource Officers for their dedication to serving and protecting all. 

We have mourned many losses to violence yet we are working hard, collectively 
as a community. Yes we have our challenges but we are going to listen and 
respect each other. It is through greater engagement with our youth, in dealing 
with crime, in preventing fires, that we will save lives. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

The value of community engagement, of building our city with the people is 
lesson could not be any more apparent than with our water woes. We need to 
take a brief trip so to speak out to the Flint Water Plant at N. Dort Hwy and 
Stewart Ave. where a lot of improvements are being made and more information 
is being provided to the public. 

Water is a basic human need and access to dean water is a right. A number of 
improvements have been made and more are on the way. We are working hard 
to get everyone to be part of the solution. Congressman Kildee has been 
supportive. Governor Snyder awarded grant funds. The State shifted a loan 
repayment. The new City Administrator has stepped in and pushed very hard to 
get projects moving-— and to make water more affordable. The new budget rolled 
back the rate increase for 2016 and cut $100 from the water deposit required of 
renters. 

The problems are being fixed. The carbon filter is on schedule to be installed in 
July. New water pipe is going in this summer along Dupont Ave. Valves are being 
exercised. A leak detection audit is being done on hundreds of miles of pipes. The 
approved capital Improvement Plan has guided the work. Projects are listed, 
prioritized, and approved by the state regulatory agency. We expect dean and 
safe water without any more notices. We must meet that goal. 

We also are now transparent with all of the test data and operational reports. 
They are posted to the website every month. The advisory groups have been very 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


8 



helpful While there are challenges going forward, we now have the best experts 
at the table. 

Our own employees are working very hard too. I am taking time with all of the 
City employees and engaging them to understand how we can be more effective 
in spite of having limited resources. I went out with a crew from the Water 
Service Center and saw for myself how professional and dedicated our City 
AFSCME workers are. 

A number of other changes are being made in the City's utility and infrastructure 
efforts. In the new budget there is a dedicated City Engineer position. A contract 
is in place with Bioworks and Chad Antle for the long awaited completion of 
turning the methane gas into usable energy. The new electric generator is 
expected to be operational later this spring. And with the efficiency of the 
digester, the final waste is able to be disposed of through land application and the 
incinerator can be shut down with even greater savings. This efficiency and 
alternative energy project, which started as Swedish Biogas where Mr. Antle was 
an engineer, is in the final stages of completion and will result in energy savings 
for the City starting in this calendar year. This is an amazing story of perseverance 
and innovation. 

Other public works divisions have benefited from innovation too. GPS units have 
been installed on fleet vehicles. Tablet computers will be issued to work crews. 
Residents can go online and report issues and complaints. These upgrades benefit 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

the entire community and all of this moves the City government closer to our 
mission of providing services effectively in the 21 st Century. 


IV. Fostering Development 

Speaking of citywide work, the Planning and Development Department has 
become a trusted ally of the entire community and is facilitating public, private 
and nonprofit investments and programs all over the place in accordance with the 
adopted comprehensive plan. The City has made considerable progress on the 
implementation of the Master Plan with over 120 strategies having been initiated 
with an estimated value of over $15 million. A summary report is available at the 
resource table with all of the details. A few projects include: Flint's first LED 
streetlight conversion, a new 911 communications tower, funds to re-open 
Harrison St. as a bicycle and pedestrian friendly complete street, new trail 
construction, wetland restoration at Max Brandon Park, improvements at Flint's 
youth centers and a lot of blight elimination among many others that I will be 
mentioning. 

Last year I announced the start of a 5 year campaign to eliminate ail of Flint's 
blight. Blight remains a serious threat to our future; the battle is underway and 
we are making progress. 

With the City and Land Bank working together, in more than 1,500 units have 
been cleared in the past year, double the number in 2013. This is making a 
positive difference all over the city. The City contributed CDBG funds to demolish 
14 commercial structures along Franklin, Davison, and Lewis. We worked together 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


10 



to secure an additional $2.6 million for demolition In Civic Park. Northside, 
eastside, all across the City, demolition has made a difference. 

We worked with the Center for Community Progress, the Genesee County Land 
Bank and many partners and community leaders on the development of the Blight 
Elimination Framework to better coordinate and leverage activities throughout 
the City based on an updated survey of all 52,000 property parcels 

Last year, the City helped with neighborhood clean ups, trash removal, boarding, 
and beautification. Rental registrations are being aggressively pursued. Since 
February 2015, Nan McKay has inspected 282 units. Raul Garcia deserves special 
recognition. He manages about 300 blight complaints per month. When he sees 
something that needs to be done, he will do it himself or work with volunteers to 
address the problem. 

Here's how the numbers add up: the new blight elimination framework which was 
developed last year and recently finalized, identified a need for $107 million to 
completely eliminate blight. Over $9 million through partnerships, commitments 
and accomplishments within the adopted blight elimination framework was 
identified in the planning process. Since adoption another $6 million raised so far 
this year and we are gathering data on privately funded demolitions too. We are 
15% to our new 5 year goal. We are going to keep working on this and 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


11 



The next big step is to adopt a new zoning code - This will require new 
development to align with the vision for every part of the city. The new zoning is 
shifting Flint from blight to rebuilding. 

And the rebuilding is already underway. Smith Village houses are selling. Oak 
Senior Apartments opened its doors. GCCARD and Habitat for Humanity have 
funding for housing improvements. There is a dear trend of workers, students, 
seniors and families wanting to live in the city when quality and affordable 
options are available. This is another sign of Flint's rebirth. 

Parks are part of our neighborhood quality of life and we have achieved dramatic 
improvements by being creative with our limited resources. The City has entered 
more partnership agreements with Keep Genesee County Beautiful, the 
Conservation District, and the County Parks, We received grants for Max Brandon, 
Brennan, McKinley, and RiverBank Park. Construction in Riverbank Park to 
improve ADA access and river access to the park including a canoe launch and the 
Genesee Valley Trail will be complete by Fall 2015. In addition, the City has made 
over $100,000 in improvements to Berston Center and has plans to invest another 
$150,000 of its CDBG into parks and its recreation centers this year. These 
citywide investments and the partnerships in place to sustain them are more signs 
of rebirth. 

The City's newest open space at Chevy Commons is transforming as we speak. 

The former brownfield will be a naturalized area and it will be open to the public 
later this year. Every one of these projects, these accomplishments is a story in 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


12 



and of itself, a story about strategic planning, community engagement, 
partnership, and investment. It was a proud moment for me to stand with our US 
Senator Debbie Stabenow, Congressman Dan Kildee, County Treasurer Deb 
Cherry, and ERA Regional Administrator Dr. Susan Hedman with the sun shining 
and al! of our partners from the river and university corridor standing together for 
the last time on the concrete floors of the former Chevrolet factories. History has 
been made over and over again in Flint and this new era will be no different. The 
transformation of the site shows that there are things from our past we can build 
on and things that we have to change as our economy and society evolves. 

People are still being drawn to our community because of the opportunities here. 
The City's economic development efforts are contributing to economic growth. 

We are making Flint more business friendly. After two years of careful study and 
broad input, the City's antiquated business ordinances have been reformed. The 
new general business license will be free for those that register in the first 90 days 
after it goes into effect this fall and small businesses and home businesses with 
less than $25,000 in revenues will always be eligible for a free license. We want to 
engage with our business community without creating a burden. For the first time 
in its history, Flint will have a data base of all businesses so that we can provide 
better information and services. 

Working with the Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce, we engage with every 
business or Investment project that has the potential to bring in jobs. In the past 
two years we have supported 2000 jobs and $1.2 billion in investments. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


13 



These projects cover a wide spectrum of business types: 
a new industrial facility in Buick City 

smaller manufacturers like Barette Outdoor and Extreme Precision 

the Michigan State University building 

new medical facilities 

St. Luke's NEW Life center 

Oak Business Center and YouthBuild 

The Flint Farmer's Market including FoodWorks 

coffee and bagel shops 

we have seen it all and these are signs of rebirth 

The largest investment came from Flint's largest employer General Motors. GM 
broke ground in 2014 on a $600 million paint shop at the Flint Assembly plant. 
The 596,000-square-foot facility was one of Michigan's largest investment 
projects in 2014 and this project is just the latest of General Motors' investments 
in its facilities here in Flint. 

Currently we are working on more than 40 prospects that could create over 300 
jobs along with more than 100 construction jobs. This represents another $80 
million that will be invested in the community and there is more to come. 

For example, the City is offering its support to Universal EMS and Metro Medical' 
proposed project at 5928 Clio Road that will bring jobs and services to an under- 
served area in North Flint. The City will be contributing the funds needed for 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


14 



demolition and we are seeking additional public funding for the remediation of 
the site. The City's Economic Development Corporation provided an early loan to 
the business as it looked to relocate to the City of Flint and expand and an 
obsolete property tax abatement was put into place in 2013. This is an example of 
how we can use everything in our toolbox to bring jobs and development into 
every part of our community. 

The new budget puts more economic development capacity in place with a formal 
partnership with the Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce and also with the 
City's Economic Development Corporation. I pledge to do everything within my 
power to work with City Council and the entire community to make Flint into a 
city of opportunity and prosperity again as we open the next chapter for Flint. 

I am passionate about the need for Flint's prosperity to be broad based and 
accessible to all. Last September I accepted the White House My Brother's Keeper 
Challenge to improve the opportunities available in particular to boys and young 
men of color. Congressman Kildee and Pastor Flynn, both of whom had already 
been working on related initiatives, stood with me to publicly commit to this 
work. Paul Joice from the White House SC2 has been instrumental in coordinating 
our efforts. 

Following President Obama's lead, the six goals of My Brother's Keeper relate to 
nearly all aspects of life for boys and young men of color, from cradle to career. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


15 



They are: 

1. Entering school ready to learn. 

2. Reading at grade level by third grade. 

3. Graduating from high school ready for college and career. 

4. Having the opportunity to complete postsecondary education or training. 

5. Successfully entering the workforce. 

6. Keeping youth safe and giving them second chances. 

Since January, City staff, Flint residents, and community leaders and students met 
to discuss the challenges facing young men of color in Flint and to identify actions 
that can be taken to address those challenges. The report released on Monday 
summarizes information collected through that process and provides 
recommendations for action. Full report is online and the summary is at the 
resource table. 

This report provides in-depth analysis of the challenges in Flint, and presents 
many of the programs and partners already in place to help young men of color. 
We know that poverty and unemployment is higher for African Americans. We 
know that educational attainment is lower with only 7.2% of African American 
males over age 25 have a bachelors degree (over 12 % for Whites). These 
disparities are unacceptable. Flint must be a City for All. 

The most important aspect is that we engaged and listened to youth, we moved 
beyond the statistics to dialogue. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


16 



Thank those who were actively involved in the process, if you attended a session 
or participated in the working groups, please stand: 

For our boys and young adults of color especially in North Flint, we are going to 
focus on Skills, Safety and Service. 

The top priority with skills is expanding community education and including family 
literacy and adult learning programming with workforce development, GED 
courses, ESL courses, and vocational training. The City is funding the Literacy 
Coalition and we will make this happen for the fall of 2015. 

The priority with Safety is for the Police Department and community leaders to 
engage youth and really listen to what they have to say. This is urgent and forums 
are already scheduled before school is out. 

With service, the focus is to connect our young adults with mentoring and 
opportunities such as AmeriCorps. 

I will be creating a task force to keep the work going in 2015. All of us have ways 
in which we can better advance these goals. All of us must do our part in Flint's 
rebirth as a city of opportunity for all. 

A giant step forward was announced yesterday with the Operation AmeriCorps 
initiative to renew community education in Flint. Community education is the first 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


17 



strategy on our list for creating more economic and educational opportunities 
which directly affects all of our young people. 

It is an honor for Flint to be chosen for one of the select communities for 
Operation AmeriCorps. I want to publicly thank the Corporation for National and 
Community Service for the innovation reflected in this new initiative and for the 
trust being placed in us in Flint. As an AmeriCorps alum and as a mayor in the 
Cities of Service coalition, I know the extraordinary potential that service has to 
transform the lives of those served and those who serve. 

Operation AmeriCorps Flint will propel the renewal of community education, 
make schools hubs for neighborhoods again, and bring in additional human 
capital focused on student academic success. Operation AmeriCorps will support 
80 AmeriCorps members over two years for Flint schools and many of those 
members will come from right here in Flint. 

The federal investment of $1.4 million is projected to generate an additional 
$360,000 in local cash and in-kind matching contributions, making the total two- 
year investment worth more than $1.7 million. None of this would be possible 
here in Flint without the support of our local foundations. In particular, I want to 
acknowledge the C.S. Mott Foundation for their foresight with establishing the 
Flint National Service Accelerator. This partnership with the Community 
Foundation of Greater Flint and the Boys & Girls Club and now the United Way 
has been a magnet for bringing national service to Flint and has provided the 
financial support for national service expansion. 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City 


18 



It has been a team effort to design this initiative. The Flint Community Schools, 
the United Way, the Crim Fitness Foundation and the City have all come together 
around common goals. One of my promises has always been to have the City and 
Schools working together. This is yet another sign of Flint's rebirth and it has 
started at the Brownell Holmes STEM Academy. 

We are at the threshold. We, all of us, all people! All neighborhoods! All kids! And 
we must move forward across the threshold as one, with all, or else this will be 
another failed attempt at redevelopment, indeed it would be a miscarriage of 
justice and a dis-service to our democracy. 

In America, we have government of the people, by the people and for the people 
as President Lincoln said. Indeed, on November 19, 1863 in Gettysburg at the 
height of the civil war, Lincoln stated "we here highly resolve that these dead shall 
not have died in vain that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not 
perish from the earth." 

While we stand in very circumstances at a very different time, we may draw 
inspiration from the President's timeless words. In Flint today, all of the sacrifices 
that have been made and losses that have been endured shall not pass in vain — 
that this city, under God shall have a rebirth— and that government of the people, 
by the people, for the people shall prosper once again." 


Mayor Dayne Walling, State of the City

This is our time. All of our time. 

It is time to rally for Flint not against each other. 

It is time to show the world what Flint can do.

BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS* MOTION TO 
DISMISS PURSUANT TO FEB. R. CIV, P, I2(B¥B AND (6) 

I. INTRODUCTION 

This is a civil suit for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the Safe Drinking 
Water Act (hereinafter “SDWA”), 42 U.S.C. §30Of et seg. t as well as for monetary damages 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C, §1983. Plaintiff is a non-profit organization allegedly organized under 
Michigan law. Defendants are the City of Flint (hereinafter “Flint”), a municipal corporation 
organized pursuant to the Michigan Home Rule City Act, and Natasha Henderson, City 
Administrator (hereinafter “City Administrator”) for the City of Flint, in her official capacity. 

In lieu of filing an Answer, Defendants move for dismissal of all counts of Plaintiffs 
Complaint. First, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the statutory notice requirements of 42 U.S.C, 
§300j~8(2), and the Court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction o ver claims in Counts I and 
IL Dismissal of Counts I and II is therefore warranted pursuant to Fed. R, Civ. P. 12(1) and 
required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). 

In addition, the allegations in Counts I and II of Plaintiffs Complaint fail to identify the 
statutory or regulatory requirement allegedly violated by Flint or the City Administrator, while 
the allegations in Counts III and IV of Plaintiffs Complaint are precluded by the SDWA as 
parallel constitutional claims. Plaintiff has thus failed to state a claim under which relief can be 
granted and dismissal is warranted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 

n. BACKGROUND 

The City of Flint owns and operates a water distribution and treatment system. Prior to 
2014, the City of Flint purchased its water from the City of Detroit, which sourced its water from 
Lake Huron, In April of 2014, Flint stopped purchasi ng water from the City of Detroit and began 
utilizing the Flint River as its primary source of water. Due to unexpected challenges of treating

river water, Flint failed to pass Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) water quality tests in 
May, August, and November of 2014. Flint has since passed the EPA water quality tests in 
February and May of 2015, but continues to send out notices as required, since the average test 
results over the previous year remain out of compliance. 

HI. ARGUMENT 

A. Standards of Review 

1. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) 

A Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss tests whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction 
over the claims in Plaintiffs Complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A court that lacks subject 
matter jurisdiction over a case must dismiss that case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). The plaintiff has 
the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction. Moir v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit 
Auth, 895 F.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir. 1990); Rogers v. Stratton Indus,, Inc., 798 F.2d 913, 915 (6th 
Cir. 1986). 

12(b)(1) motions are either factual or facial attacks. United States v. Ritchie , 1 5 F.3d 592, 
598 (6th Cir, 1994). Facial attacks challenge the pleading itself, and are resolved under the same 
standard as a 12(b)(6) motion (i.e.. all well-pleaded allegations are accepted as true and 
construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant). Id. A factual attack, in contrast, 
challenges the factual existence of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. With a factual attack, the court 
does not presume the truth of the allegations and is free to “weigh the evidence and satisfy itself 
as to the existence of its power to hear the case.” Id. 

2. Fed, R, Civ. P, 12(h)(6) 

A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests whether the well-pleaded allegations in the 

Plaintiffs Complaint state a claim under which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 

The Complaint must allege “sufficient facts that, accepted as true, ‘state a claim to relief that is 

2 



2 : 1 5-cv- 12084 ~ SJ M - D R G Doc #7 Filed 06/23/15 Pg 9 of 14 Pg ID 56 


plausible on its face,” 1 Sutton v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville and Davidson Cnty., 700 P.3d 865, 
871 (6th Gir, 2012) {citing Bell Atlantic Corp. y, Twombly , 550 U,S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A claim 
has facial plausibility when the . . . plead [ed] factual content allows the court to draw the 
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,” Ashcroft v, Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 

Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a Complaint contain “a short a plain statement of the claim 
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ, P. 8(a)(2). This standard, while not 
requiring “detailed factual allegations ” does require more them “labels and conclusions” or “a 
formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 
U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Conelusory allegations are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Iqbal, at 
679; see Eidson v. Tenn. Dep’t of Children’s Servs ., 510 F.3d 631, 634 (6th Cir. 2007) 
(“Conelusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations will not 
suffice.”). 

B. Dismissal of Counts I and II is Warranted Because Plaintiff has Failed to 
Satisfy the Notice Requirement of 42 U.S.C. §3004-8(2) and the Court 
Therefore Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Those Counts 

The SDWA creates a civil cause of action against any person, including a governmental 

instrumentality, alleged to be in violation any requirement prescribed by or under the SDWA. 42 

U.S.C. §300j-8(a)(l). However, the SDWA prohibits this civil cause of action unless the plaintiff 

has given notice of such violation to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA), the alleged violator, and the State in which the violation occurs. 42 U.S.C. §3GGj~8(b)(l). 

Failure to give such notice deprives the Court of subject matter jurisdiction. See Hattstrom v. 

Tillamook County . 493 U.S. 20, 32 (1989) (holding that failure to comply with an identically 

worded provision in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act acted as a total bar to suit); 


3 



2 : 1 S-cv-12084 - S J M-DRG Doc # ? Filed 06/23/15 Pg 10 of 14 Pg ID 57 

see also Curtis v City of Bullhead , 69 Fed. Appx. 377 (9th €ir 2003) (upholding dismissal of 
SDWA claims due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction resulting from insufficient notice). 

Counts I and II allege violations of the SDWA. Plaintiff has utterly failed to allege the 
required notice to any of the three persons listed in subsection (b)(1). Furthermore, on 
information and belief, Plaintiff has not only failed to allege that such notice was provided, but 
has in fact failed to provide such notice. Defendants thus factually attack the Court's subject 
matter jurisdiction in this matter. Since Plaintiff bears the burden of proving subject matter 
jurisdiction, Plaintiff must show that the proper notice was given to all three of the persons 
named in subsection (b)(1). Absent such a showing, a civil action in this matter will be barred by 
statute, the Court will lack subject matter jurisdiction, and dismissal of Counts I and II is 
required pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3). 

C. Even if Subject Matter Jurisdiction is Somehow Established. Dismissal of 
Counts I and II is also Warranted Because Plaintiff’s Complaint Fails to 
Allege a Valid Cause of Action 

A civil action pursuant to the SD WA must allege a violation of a requirement of or under 
the SDWA. 42 U.S.C. §3G0j-8(a)(l). While Counts I and II of Plaintiffs Complaint allege that 
“the City has violated the Safe Drinking Water Act,” such an allegation is the essence of a 
“formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.” Nowhere does Plaintiff allege which 
specific regulation or statutory' provision of the SDWA has been violated. Under the Federal 
pleading standard, simply alleging a variety of purported errors or misdeeds is insufficient ~ the 
purported errors or misdeeds must constitute a violation of a specific provision of the SDWA. 
See Twomhly s 550 U.S. at 555, Plaintiffs allegations of a violation of the SWDA are purely 
conclusory and not entitled to acceptance by the Court. 


4 






2 : 1 5-cv- 1 2084-SJ M~ D R G Doc # ? 


Filed 06/23/15 Pg 11 of 14 Pg ID 58 


The insufficiency of Plaintiff’s allegation of a violation is further illustrated by 

comparing them with the promulgated regulations on notice. Federal regulations require that; 

“Notice regarding tin alleged violation of any requirement 
prescribed by or under the Act shall include sufficient information 
to permit the recipient to identify the specific requirement 
alleged to have been violated, the activity alleged to constitute a 
violation, the person or persons responsible for the alleged 
violation, the location of the alleged violation, the date or dates of 
the alleged violation, and the full name, address, and telephone 
number of the person giving notice.” 

40 CFR 135.12(a) (emphasis added). This regulation creates the rule for sufficient notice of an 
alleged SWDA violation. Plaintiffs allegations do not meet this standard, and Plaintiff should be 
held to no lesser standard in a civil action. Plaintiff has thus failed to state a claim upon which 
relief can be granted. Dismissal of Counts I and II of Plaintiffs Complaint is therefore also 
warranted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 

D. Dismissal of Counts III and IV is Warranted Because the SDWA is a 
Comprehensive Remedial Scheme Precluding Parallel Constitutional 
Claims And Plaintiff Has Therefore Failed to State a Claim On Which 
Relief Can Be Granted 

The Supreme Court of the United States has determined that a civil rights claim pursuant 
to 42 IJ.S.C. §1983 may be precluded by other Federal statutes. Smith v Robinson , 468 U.S. 992, 
1009 (1984). To preclude a §1983 claim, the claims under both §1983 and the other Federal 
statute must be “virtually identical,” and the other Federal statute must provide a scheme of 
remedies comprehensive enough to be exclusive. Id. Both conditions must be satisfied in order 
for a §1983 claim to be precluded. Id. The Sixth Circuit has not yet addressed whether the 
SDWA’s civil cause of action precludes parallel claims under §1983.* However, the First Circuit 


f The Sixth Circuit has determined that the whistleblower protections of the SDWA do not preclude a parallel §1983 
claim for violations of First Amendment civil rights, Charvat v. E. Ohio Reg ! t Wastewater Auth., 246 F.3d 607, 614- 

5 






2:15-cv-12084~SJM-DRG Doc #7 Filed 06/23/15 Pg 12 of 14 Pg!D59 

has examined this issue in detail and concluded that the SDWA preempts parallel §1983 claims. 
Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 980 F,2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1982). The First Circuit’s analysis is sound 
and instructive. 

The Supreme Court has held that §1983 suits can be precluded by other similar federal 
statutes. See Middlesex County Sewarage Auth v. Nat 7 Sea Gammers Ass ’n , 453 U.S, 1, 20 
(1981 ) (holding that §1983 claims are precluded by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and 
the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act). In Matoon, the First Circuit held that, 
similar to the statutes examined in Sea Gammers , the SDWA (1) establishes an elaborate 
enforcement scheme, with rights of action on both government and private citizens; (2) civil 
actions can result in compelled compliance, compliance orders, and civil penalties; (3) states are 
invested with primary enforcement authority after the Administrator of the EPA determines that 
the state has adopted sufficient regulations and procedures; (4) private actions are allowed 
pertaining to the nationwide regulations and standards; and (5) citizens may initiate proceedings 
against violators as well as against the Administrator for failure to perform nan-discretionary 
duties. Mattoon at 5-6, Using this analysis, the SDWA clearly provides a comprehensive scheme 
of remedies that should be considered exclusive. 

The only remaining question is whether Plaintiffs claims under §1983 are “virtually 
identical” to their claims under the SDWA, Counts 01 and IV of Plaintiffs Complaint request 
that the Court "find that Plaintiffs (sic) have a liberty or property interest in. safe drinking water, 
that Defendants have violated that right without due process of law . . .” PL Compl. at 16, 18, In 
comparison, Counts I and II of Plaintiffs Complaint ask the Court for a declaratory judgment in 


615 (6th Cir. 2001). However, the analysis was particular to the whistleblower section of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. 
§3001-9, which is different from that of the civil action section relevant to this case. See 42 U.S.C. §300j-8. 

6 



2:15-cv-12084-SJM-DRG Ooc # 7 Filed 06/23/15 Pg 13 of 14 Pg ID 60 


regards to the alleged lack of safe drinking water provided by Flint, and injunctive and/or 
declaratory relief as regards to the same. PI. Compl. at 13-1 5. 

Except for artfully pleading a constitutional claim, Plaintiff’s §1983 claims in Counts III 
and IV and its SDWA claims in Counts I and II are clearly identical, as both revolve around the 
alleged failure of Flint to provide safe drinking water to Plaintiff. The SDWA clearly provides a 
comprehensive remedial scheme. Counts 111 and IV of Plaintiffs Complaint fail to state a claim 
on which relief can be granted, because Plaintiffs §1983 claims are precluded by the SDWA. 
Dismissal of Counts III and IV is therefore warranted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 

IV. CONCLUSION 

Plaintiffs failure to provide the notice required by the SDWA deprives the Court of 
subject matter jurisdiction over Counts I and If and dismissal of those counts, pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) is therefore required by Fed. R. Civ, P. 12(h)(3). In addition, Counts I and II 
fail to state a claim on which relief can be granted because they fail to allege which specific 
statutory or regulatory requirements were violated, warranting dismissal of Counts I and II 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Counts III and IV are parallel Constitutional claims that are 
precluded by the SDWA and Plaintiff has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted, 
warranting dismissal of those counts pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

Mayor Dayne Walling’s Visit to Washington, D.C. for White House Welcome of Pope 
Francis will Include Meetings with Federal Partners 


Flint, Michigan - September 21, 2015 - Flint Mayor Dayne Walling will be travelling to our nation’s capital to 
join a White House delegation welcoming Pope Francis to the White House during his trip to the United States. 
Pope Francis will arrive in Washington, D.C. on September 22, 2015 and will be greeted the following day 
during a ceremony hosted by President and First Lady Obama on the White House’s South Lawn. 

While the welcome ceremony for the Pope is the primary focus of the Mayor’s trip to D.C., he will also be 
meeting with federal representatives to discuss matters important to the City of Flint. Mayor Walling is 
scheduled to meet with officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of 
Justice and the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Those meetings are scheduled for both 
Tuesday, September 22, and Wednesday, September 23.

Yes we are doing filter replacements. This is why we are verifying addresses and contact numbers in a

Brad, 

We are being told the free water filters for people living 
in Flint must be replaced after 100 gallons. What 
happens after that, will there be replacement filters 
handed out when that need arises? 

Thanks.

DRAFT INFORMATION 


Brad, 

Per your request 


l 



FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS: 


WHAT DID WE FIND? 

1) The results of the initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the 
last round of community lead and copper testing. 

2) There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools. Of those 37 samples, 4 exceeded the 15 ppb 
action level. There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level: Eisenhower Elementary 
(which had two samples exceeding 15 ppb). Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each 
had one sample exceeding 15 PPB. The sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than 
the other samples at 101 PPB. 

3) Looking at the data from a health based perspective, the data clearly demonstrates that more 
detailed sampling needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within 
each respective school's plumbing can be identified and addressed. 


WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN? 

1) The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system 
within each school. 

2) We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with 
schools to implement these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to 
address this issue. 

3) The State is identifying staff within DEQ, DHHS, LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist 
schools in conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems. 


WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL? 

1) DEQ's protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and in other States. 

2) Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed 
intervals to identify levels of lead and its likely source. 

3) Once an evaluation is complete, we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive 
plan to address issues on a site specific basis. 


HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND? 



1) Schools should continue protective measures that are currently in place until such time that a 
complete study can be conducted at each school. This includes the continued use of bottled water for 
consumption purposes. 


2) We will be reaching out to schools in order to schedule a complete evaluation, assessment and 
sampling, of their plumbing systems. 


THE INFORMATION BELOW IS FOR A SEPARATE TOPIC 
- Lime Softening has the effect of elevating the pH in water 



- The pH of the water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leaching of lead from pipes into 
the water 

- As per the requirements in the Lead/Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for two 
consecutive monitoring periods and the results of the monitoring demonstrated that further action was 
necessary. 

- The DEQ promptly notified the Flint water system of the need for additional measures and the city of 
Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need.

City of Flint Water Funding Solution.pdf 


Importance: 


High 


Attached is a summary of the funding commitments to address the Flint Water situation. The total state commitment 
is $10.4m; $7. 9m of that amount is GF/GP. [The DHHS number needs to be verified tomorrow morning, but the final 
number should be close to this estimate.] 

The funding will address 4 priority areas: 

1. Provision of filters for residential service; 

2. 50% of the estimated cost to reconnect temporarily to the Detroit Water System; 

3. Funding for testing water samples; and 

4. Other state assistance (e.g., home/school/health facility inspections and follow-up for children with elevated 
blood levels). 

We are preparing a formal supplemental request to transmit to the Legislature tomorrow. John intends to talk with Rep. 
Pscholka and Sen. Hildenbrand about including this funding in HB 4102, the pending supplemental bill now awaiting 
House concurrence. Assuming that they agree, we would ask for final action next week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about our planned approach. 

Nancy

Karen, 

Attached is the requested information. 

Please note that I was having issues getting it into a PDF format that was user friendly. Here it is 
in Excel format and perhaps Eric can convert it. Please also note that it contains a sample 
description as there are multiple samples from each location. The description clarifies where the 
sample was taken.

George, 

I'm hoping to get some edited form of the school testing results that we can put on the website 
for media and the public tomorrow. Can it include just the school name and the parts per billion 
result? With the dates the samples were taken 9 

Do you think there's any other crucial piece of information we need to include? 

I think an excel type format will work will, but it should be saved as a pdf.

Dan Wyant called Brian Whiston last night to let him know of the questionable lead levels they found in three Flint 
elementary schools and that further screening will be done... 

I know that the Gov and Dan Wyant are going to be having a press conf in Flint today. Is there an embargoed press 
release or other background that we can prepare Brian with, if we get calls? 

Thanks.

Hi Jennifer, 


I am looping in Wurfel on this as I just provided her with the attached spreadsheet. There is some confusion out there 
on the $3.5 million and Jonathon Oosting also calied on this, Sara, do you want me to just call Eggert and vvaik him 
through the spreadsheet so he understands? Oosting just called me directly and ! explained It to him, so I can do the

Issue 


Just spoke with Wayne. He has calls in to Flint and we are awaiting written confirmation that the city made the up-front 
payment to DWSD. 

If you need to respond before we receive that (from the city admin, or the mayor) he suggests something along the lines 
of the following: 

Our understanding of the original plan to re-connect with DWSD called for monthly payments from the city. Without 
consulting the State or the Mott Foundation, the city agreed to an up-front payment to DWSD (of the full amount). 

Upon receiving written confirmation that the full payment was made to DWSD, the State will wire to the city, the 
remainder of the $6m appropriation for the reconnection to DWSD.

Journal and Darnell's guest column. 


Interesting that instead of running Darnell's guest column as a guest column, the Journal instead calls it a "statement" 
and runs two paragraphs of it, instead allowing the others to continue criticizing Earley. 

Curious why they would take that approach on this when they run intact guest columns from just about anyone else. 
Seems to me that after the near-daily attacks, the fair thing would have been to run his full statement in the way it was 
intended. 

He should complain.

Hi Dave, 

That's correct. All emergencies and disaster declarations begin and end at the local level through 
the Michigan Emergency Management Act (Public Act 390 of 1976). 

Our third district Michigan State Police emergency management coordinator has been working 
closely working with Genesee County Emergency Management Coordinator Jenifer Boyer. At 
this time, the county has not requested state assistance through the Michigan Emergency 
Management Act. 

Jenifer Boyer would be a good source to talk to about what sort of local declarations have been 
made and operations are taking place at the local level. 

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions. 

Thanks,

Hi Damon, 

I'm including on this email Ron Leix from Michigan State Police, who is the expert in all things 
related to emergencies. 

My impression is that such a declaration request starts with local authorities. Ron, can you help 
me with the process and how it works? 

Damon, it's also important to remember that the state continues to work with Flint leaders on 
their infrastructure challenges. In addition to the $6 million the state recently approved for the 
temporary reconnection to the Great Lakes Water Authority, the state earlier awarded the city $2 
million in grants to improve infrastructure and $2.2 million in savings from restructured loans 
that can be directed to infrastructure repairs.

Subject: Flint Water Inquiry 

There are several groups who are demanding the Governor issue a State of Emerfency related to 
the water & infrastructure situation in Flint. They claim it would open up the door for federal 
assistance. 

My questions are... 

DOES the governor have the power/authority to declare a State of Emergency for issues like 
what's happening in Flint? 

IF such a declaration was made- does it open the doors to federal assistance for example... to 
replace old lead service lines... and/or other infrastructure? 

Has the governor considered/discussed asking for additional monetary help from the federal 


2 



government for infrastructure repairs/replacements in Flint? 

Lastly, the governor has called for a third party review of the decision making that went into 
Flint's water source switch- problems that followed. What's the latest on that effort? Will the 
legislature have a role- Sen. Ananich says Legislature should have a role. 

Thank you

December 2014 



The Michigan Emergency Management Act (Public Act 390 of 1976, as amended) outlines the 
emergency management process for the state of Michigan. If an incident exhausts state resources, the 
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 USC §§ 5121-5207) establishes 
the process for requesting and obtaining a presidential disaster declaration and assistance from the 
federal government. 

STEP BY STEP: Emergency or Disaster Declaration Process 

1 . Disasters are first and foremost local events. Most disasters are handled by local government with 
minimal or no state assistance. At the onset of a disaster or emergency, local emergency 
responders, joined by volunteers and the private sector, are the first to be involved. 

2. A local jurisdiction may declare a “Local State of Emergency” exists when they have sustained 
widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life or property. A local declaration ensures the 
response and recovery aspects of the emergency operations plan have been activated, and local 
resources are being utilized to the fullest extent possible. Authorities may authorize local aid and 
assistance. 

3. If recovery efforts are beyond the ability of local government, the community may turn to the state to 
request assistance. All requests for assistance are channeled through the Michigan State Police, 
Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division. 

4. The Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division reviews 
specific requests for state assistance and makes recommendations to the Governor’s Office. The 
Governor’s authority, granted by the Michigan Emergency Management Act, may include mobilizing 
state government agencies to provide necessary support and assistance to local authorities under a 
“State of Emergency” or “State of Disaster” declaration. 

5. If state and local government resources are unable to cope with the emergency or disaster, the 
Governor may request assistance through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Region V Office in Chicago. 

6. At the request of the Governor, FEMA may conduct a Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) in 
cooperation with state and local emergency management officials. The results of the PDA will be 
reviewed by state officials and the Governor’s Office and used as a basis for determining whether to 
request federal financial assistance. 

7. Should the state request federal disaster assistance, FEMA will review the request and make a 
recommendation to the president, who will make the final determination on any disaster aid to be 
provided to the state. The goal of disaster assistance is not to make individuals, businesses or 
government entities whole again, but to restore the community to a level that meets expected health 
and safety considerations.

City of Flint 


Analysis of Flint River as Wafer Supply 


!. Purpose 

This study evaluates the feasibility of utilizing the City of Flint’s Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and 
Flint River as the primary water supply for the City of Flint. The study evaluates whether the Flint 
River is an adequate source of water for the City of Flint and identifies upgrades needed to reliably 
supply water on a continuous basis. 

II. History 

The City of Flint’s WTP was constructed in 1917 and supplied water to city customers for drinking 
and industrial uses. Records indicate that Flint supplied approximately 16 rngd in 1940 and that by 
the mid-1950s water use had increased to about 45 nigd. This significant increase coincided with 
increases in automobile production and population in the area. The Holloway Reservoir was 
constructed in 1954 to increase water supply capacity to meet the growing demand. Because of 
continued concerns regarding the adequacy of the Flint River for meeting the future water supply 
needs of the area, the city evaluated alternatives for a new water supply and ultimately contracted 
with the City of Detroit in 1 967 for water supply. Detroit continues to supply water to Flint and its 
customers today. Detroit supplies finished water to the city via a single transmission pipeline. For 
reliability, the city’s WTP has been maintained as a backup water supply in the event of a disruption 
to the single supply pipeline. 

Because of recent concerns with the cost and reliability of the existing water supplies, the City of 
Flint, Genesee County, Lapeer County, the City of Lapeer, and Sanilac County are evaluating 
alternatives for their long-term water supply. The most recent study ( Preliminary Engineering 
Re port, Lake Huron Supply. Karegnondi Water Authority: September 2009) focused on two primary 
alternatives: Alternative 1 - continued supply by Detroit, and Alternative 2 - development of a new 
Lake Huron water supply. This study evaluates a third alternative. Alternative 3 provides for 
utilizing the existing City of Flint WTP to treat water from the Flint River. Alternative 3 assumes 
that water will be supplied only to customers within the city. 

To evaluate the feasibility of Alternative 3, the river and WTP will be examined to determine their 
ability to supply water in sufficient quantity meeting current and anticipated regulations. There have 
been many new rules and regulations for treatment of surface water since 1967 when Flint’s WTP 
was last used as a primary water supply, 

III. Regulatory Requirements for Quantity of Source Water 

Regulations require that the quantity of water at the source shall: 

• Be adequate to meet the maximum projected water demand of the service area as shown by 
calculations based on a one in fifty year drought or the extreme drought of record, and should 
include consideration of multiple year droughts. Requirements for flows downstream of the 
intake shall comply with requirements of the appropriate reviewing authority. 

• Provide reasonable surplus for anticipated growth. 

• Be adequate to compensate for all losses such as silting, evaporation, seepage, etc. 

• Be adequate to provide ample water for other legal users of the source.

City of Flint 


Analysis of Fiint River as Water Supply 


IV. Demands 

The alternative of utilizing the city’s WTP and Flint River as a water supply will be evaluated on the 
basis of supplying water to Flint’s direct customers only. Although Fiint currently supplies water to 
GCDC-WWS, for this analysis it is assumed that GCDC-WWS receives its primary water supply by 
another source. Table 1 summarizes the city’s current and projected demands for direct customers of 
the city. Projections have been provided by city representatives.

14.0 

mgd 

15.0

Maximum Day Demand (MDD)

mgd 


Actual water requirements will be greater than the amount of water provided to customers. About ten 
percent additional water must be added for treatment processes and system operation. Water for fire- 
fighting is not included in customer demands and must be added to the quantity of water needed. 

Surface water sources must be adequate to supply water through a drought period. Although the 
MDD is projected to be 18 mgd, the sustained maximum demand over a longer period will be less 
than the MDD. Analysis of records of water use indicates that the 30-day sustained maximum 
demand is about 80% of the MDD. Table 2 summarizes the source water requirements to supply the 
city’s future needs.

V. Drought Flows 

USGS records indicate that the most severe drought in Michigan occurred between 1930 and 1937, 
and that the low stream flows experienced during this period have a recurrence interval of 50 to 70 
years. River flow records which include the drought of the 1930s will be used to evaluate the 
adequacy of the river as a permanent water source. 

VI. Reservoir Losses 

Roth the Holloway Dam and Mott Dam were constructed since the drought period of the 1930s, If 
used to simulate the “design drought conditions”, the records of flow on the Flint River from the 
1930’s should be adjusted for potential impact from the addition of these two dams and resulting 
reservoirs.

City of Flint 


Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


A, Evaporation 

If the two reservoirs had existed during the drought period, the flows in the river would have been 
a little less because of the volume of water which would have been lost to evaporation from these 
two bodies of water'. 

8, Sedimentation 

The July 2001 Flint River Assessment completed by the MDNR indicates that sedimentation 
occurs in the Holloway Reservoir at an accelerated rate, but does not provide specific volumes. 
Sedimentation reduces the storage volume of reservoirs. No investigation to determine the 
amount of sedimentation has been completed in the Holloway Reservoir since its construction, 
but the storage volume of the reservoir has certainly decreased since its construction. 

Mott Dam maintains a fixed water level, so storage for water supply is not available. Therefore, 
sedimentation in Mott Lake is not a concern with respect to water supply. 

C. Seepage 

The land adjacent to both the Holloway Reservoir and Mott Lake has a relatively high 
groundwater table. Any loss of water by seepage from the bottom of the reservoirs seems likely 
to flow back to the river downstream of the respective dams, resulting in little or no impact to the 
quantity of water available for water supply or flow augmentation. Loss from the reservoirs by 
seepage is not considered a significant factor. 

Vii, Other Water Uses 

Since 1967 when Detroit began supplying water to Flint, the Holloway Reservoir has been utilized as 
a backup water source, source of flow augmentation for the river, and for recreational purposes. 
Although the city maintains control over the dam and water levels; the city has leased their 
surrounding lands to the Genesee County Parks and Recreation Commission (GCPRC) for park, 
recreational, and conservation purposes. In 1987, the city and GCPRC adopted the Holloway 
Reservoir Management Plan (HRMP) which defined how water levels in the reservoir were to be 
maintained to achieve the goals above. The HRMP establishes a summer water level of 755 and a 
winter level of 751. Discharge from the reservoir is to be maintained above 65 cfs except when the 
level is less than 75 1 ; outflow from the reservoir is not to exceed inflow to the reservoir. A copy of 
the HRMP is included in Appendix 1 . 

Flow augmentation for the city’s WWTP discharge is another consideration. The city’s NPDES 
permit for their WWTP indicates that a Flint River drought flow of 85 cfs was used to determine the 
permitted limits for WWTP effluent. It appears that the FIRMP requirement to maintain a 65 cfs 
minimum at the Holloway Reservoir was established to provide adequate flow in the river at the 
city’s WWTP outfall. An excerpt of the city’s WWTP NPDES permit is included Appendix 2. 

The existing water supply contract between the city and Genesee County Drain Commissioner 
Division of Water and Waste Services (GCDC-WWS) provides that both the city and GCDC-WWS 
supply the other up to 8 mgd of finished water in the event of an emergency or supply disruption. For 
this analysis, it is assumed that the Flint WTP and river must be able to supply 8 mgd to GCDC-

Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


WWS in the event of an emergency in addition to the quantity consumed by the city’s water 
customers. The need to provide backup to GCDC-WWS is assumed to be limited to a period of two 
weeks. Over a 14 day period, 125 million gallons of water should be reserved to meet the 
commitment for an emergency supply. 

VIII. Analysis of Adequacy of Flint River 

A detailed analysis of the adequacy of the Flint River as a water supply source is included in 
Appendix 3 . This section provides an overview. 

In 1977 when the HRMP was executed, water was not withdrawn from the Flint River for water 
supply. In 1977 without any withdrawal for water supply, the HRMP provided for a minimum 
discharge of 65 cfs from the Holloway Reservoir, to provide for a river flow of 85 cfs at the city’s 
WWTP. If water is withdrawn from the river for water supply, the minimum flow from the reservoir 
must be increased by the rate of WTP withdrawal if the 85 cfs base flow is to be maintained at the 
city’s WWTP, With Flint’s future sustained demand estimated to be 16.7 mgd (26 cfs), a minimum 
flow of 91 cfs (65 cfs 4- 26 cfs) will be needed from the Holloway Reservoir to maintain the 85 cfs 
base flow at the WWTP. 

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) in a 1963 report Water Resources o f the Flint Area 
Michigan examined the Flint River as a water supply for Flint. Using river flow records between 
1930 and 1952, the USGS report includes a Draft-Storage curve for the Holloway Reservoir. If a 
minimum discharge of 91 cfs is to be maintained during a drought period, 6.2 billion gallons water 
would need to be withdrawn from the reservoir to supplement natural river flow. 

In addition to the 6.2 billion gallons of storage to maintain the existing rates of flow in the river plus 
water supply, additional storage is required to provide GCDC-WWS an emergency supply and to 
make up for reservoir losses, The following table summarizes the total storage needed. 


Table 3: Storage Requirements 
Storage to meet sustained demand and WWTP flow 
Storage to provide backup supply to GCDC-WWS 
Storage to make up loss by evaporation 
Storage lost by siltation 
Storage to provide loss by seepage 
Storage Needed to Supplement River Flow 


To provide 7.85 billion gallons of storage, the Holloway Reservoir operating level must be raised by 
at least three feet to 758 feet. Although possible, there are many challenges associated with operating 
the Holloway Reservoir at the 758 feet level, 

• The existing drum gates used to control reservoir level are designed for adjustment over a four 
feet range (751 feet to 755 feet). The design of the dam is such that the existing gates cannot 
simply be replaced with larger ones to increase the upper level to 758 feet. The dam spillway will 
likely need to be reworked to accommodate the larger drum gates. Drawings showing the details 
of the dam are included in Appendix 4.

Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


• Although operation at the 758 water level provides five feet of freeboard to the top of the dam, 
the watershed contributing to the reservoir is quite large and has resulted in quick increases in the 
reservoir level during extreme rain events. The reduction in freeboard will result in a reduced 
safety factor for managing flood events, 

• Seepage through the earthen dam embankment will increase as a result of the increased hydraulic 
pressure with the higher water level. Increased seepage through the dam’s embankment wiii 
reduce the strength and integrity of the embankment and is likely to increase maintenance needs. 

• The 758 feet water level is based on an assumption regarding the loss of the reservoir volume by 
siltation. The depth of siltation should be measured to better determine the quantity of siltation 
and its impact on storage and reservoir level, 

• Recreational activities, the fishery, and adjacent properties will be impacted by use of the 
reservoir for water supply. Normal water levels will be increased by three feet and during dry 
periods, the water levels may vary by several feet. During an extreme drought period, water 
levels may be as much as 1 1 feet below normal levels. 

• If the 85 cfs drought flow at the city’s WWTP cannot be achieved, a new NPDES permit with 
stricter discharge limits may issued by the MDEQ. This could result in higher WWTP costs for 
the city. 

Analysis shows that without modification, the Holloway Reservoir can support a sustained maximum 
day demand of 1 1.6 mgd for water supply through a drought period. 

IX. Dams 

If the Flint River is to be used as water supply, existing dams will continue to be critical for 
management of the flows in the river and water supply. Following is a summary of the dams on and 
adjacent to the river.

Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


A, Holloway Dam 

The Holloway Dam was last inspected in 2008 and was reported to be in good condition, A copy 
of the 2008 Dam Safety Report is included in Appendix 5. Other than routine maintenance, the 
following upgrades /modifications are recommended to provide a water supply of up to 11.6 
mgd: 

o Replacement of drum gate bearings 

o Installation of river flow gage on North Branch of Flint K iver 

o Improved instrumentation to measure and monitor gate positions and water surface level 
If the river is to be used as a water supply of greater capacity than 11.6 mgd, additional 
modifications are required at the Holloway Dam to allow for operation at an increased water 
level. These improvements will include replacement of gates with larger ones and reworking of 
the dam spillway to accommodate the larger gates. The existing embankment should be armored 
to strengthen the dam’s embankment and protect against erosion from wave action. A budget of 
$2.57 million is established for the upgrades to the Holloway Dam to provide adequate capacity 
for the projected future demands, 

B, Mott Dam 

The Mott Dam is under the jurisdiction of the GCPRC. The reservoir level is maintained by a 
fixed weir so the reservoir volume is not available for storage. The dam has been reported to be 
in good condition, 

C. Utah Dam 

Utah Dam is inoperable and in poor condition. A copy of the 2008 Dam Safety Report is 
included in Appendix 6. Recent studies and evaluations conclude that the dam is of little benefit 
and should be removed. The 2010 Hamilton Dam Modifications and Riverfront Restoration PER 
provides a budget of $1.9 M for removal of the Utah Dam, including replacement with a 
pedestrian bridge, construction of a boat launch, and local storm sewer upgrades. 

D. Hamilton Dam 

The Hamilton Dam is in poor condition and considered unstable. A copy of the 2008 Dam Safety 
Report is provided in Appendix 7. The dam has been the subject of extensive study and 
recommended for removal and replacement. The 2010 Hamilton Dam Modifications and 
Riverfront Restoration PER provides a budget of $7. 1 M for the removal and replacement of the 
dam, including ancillary upgrades to adjacent portions of the river. 

The new Hamilton Dam is proposed at a lower elevation than the existing dam to reduce potential 
for flooding. A reduced water level upstream of the dam will reduce the water pool depth at the 
WTP intake, unless the Utah Dam is replaced or another dam is added. Testing of pumps at the 
WTP was completed to determine the impact of a reduced water depth at the WTP intake. 
Allowing for two feet of loss through the WTP intake screens after operation, reduction of tiie 
height of the Hamilton Dam by 1 .5 feet or more will Impact WTP’s ability to draw water from the 
river.

E. Kearsiey Dam 

The Kearsiey Dam is reported in satisfactory condition. Although the dam is located downstream 
of the city’s WTP, water from the dam and Kearsiey Lake supplements the river flow in advance 
of the Hamilton Dam, therefore contributing to the impoundment from which the WTP draws 
water. Water from the Kearsiey Creek also serves to augment river flow at the city’s WWTP 
located further downstream. 

The storage volume of Kearsiey Lake is relatively minor in relation to the storage deficit from 
Section VIII. Supplemental flows to the river from the Kearsiey Creek are included in the USGS 
records included in this analysis 

The dam is an important component of the city’s water supply system because of its potential 
contribution to the WTP intake. Although currently in satisfactory condition, there will be 
ongoing maintenance needs to be addressed. 

F. Thread Lake Dam 

The Thread Lake Darn is reported to be in poor condition. Flow from the Thread Creek 
supplements die river flow prior to the city’s WWTP. The storage provided by Thread Lake is 
negligible and flow from Thread Creek is included in the USGS records of river flow used for 
this analysis. 

The Thread Lake Dam remains a facility of the city which because of its poor condition needs to 
be addressed. However, since the dam appears to be of little benefit to the water supply 
considered in this analysis, a budget for upgrades or removal has not been included in the costs 
for water supply. 

X, Source Water Quality 

Since the Flint WTP is the backup water supply in the event of a disruption to the supply from 
Detroit, raw water at the WTP intake is regularly sampled and analyzed. Available records provide a 
good understanding of the characteristics of the raw water and ranges of variances, and will be helpful 
to design water treatment processes and estimate operating costs. 

Preliminary analysis indicates that water from the river can be treated to meet current regulations; 
however, additional treatment will be required than for Lake Huron water. This results in higher 
operating costs than the alternative of a new Lake Huron supply. 

Although water from the river can be treated to meet regulatory requirements, aesthetics of the 
finished water will be different than that from Lake Huron. As an example, the temperature of water 
supplied to customers during the summer will be warmer than the present Lake Huron supply, 
because of the increased summer temperature in the relatively shallow river. 

A detailed investigation of potential sources of contamination has not been completed. The MDEQ 
lias reported that the Richfield Landfill is considering an application for an NPDES permit to allow 


Page | 7 



City of Flint 


Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


for discharge of stormwater and/or treated leachate to the Holloway Reservoir. If an NPDES permit 
is issued, there may be an impact on the quality of source water. 

If used for water supply, a source water protection management plan should be developed to study the 
watershed, identity potential sources of contamination, and enact safeguards to prevent or control 
future threats. 

XI. Water Treatment 

For comparison with other alternatives, it is assumed that the Flint WTP will treat water from the 
river to provide a finished water of similar quality to the other alternatives being considered 
(continued Detroit supply and new Lake Huron supply). 

A review of the city’s WTP has been completed (Technical Memorandum. Cost of Service Study. 
Flint Water Treatment Plant prepared by Lockwood, Andrews, and Newnam (LAN), dated June 
201 1) to evaluate its ability to treat water from the river on a continuous basis to meet current and 
anticipated regulations and produce high quality finished water. Details regarding this review and 
analysis are provided in Appendix 8. 

Although the WTP has been maintained and operated as a backup water supply, there have been 
numerous changes in regulations and standards since the WTP last supplied water on a continuous 
basis. Although equipment and systems at the WTP have been used sparingly, some existing 
equipment and systems require replacement from deterioration or obsolescence to provide reliability 
for continuous operation. 

Following is a summary of upgrades needed. 

A. Lime Sludge Disposal 

Prior to supply of water by DWSD, the city’s WTP disposed of lime sludge from water treatment 
operations at the Bray Road disposal site. The city is working with !he MDEQ to address 
concerns at the Bray Road site; for this study it has been assumed that new sludge handling and 
disposal provisions will be utilized. Lime residual handling and disposal facilities have an 
estimated project cost of $15.1 million. No costs have been included for remediation of the Bray 
Road site. 

B. Soda Ash Feed System 

Records of analyses of the source water indicate non-carbonate hardness. To remove the non- 
carbonate hardness and provide softening, soda ash should be added during treatment. The 
addition of a soda ash feed system has an estimated project budget of $0.5 million. 

C. Chemical Storage 

Bulk chemical storage of at least 30 days is needed if the plant operates on a continuous basis. 
New storage tanks for liquid carbon dioxide, liquid oxygen, and liquid nitrogen will be needed. 
The project budget for chemical storage is $2.1 million.

Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


D. Electrical and SCADA 

The power requirements of equipment at the WTP exceed the capacity of the substation which 
supplies the plant. Backup power generators at the WTP are not currently operable. Upgrades 
are recommended to power feeders for several of the existing systems. New SCADA is 
recommended to provide control and monitoring of operations at the WTP. The project budget 
for these upgrades is $8.1 million. 

E. Post Chlorination and Zebra Mussel Control 

Zebra mussels are an invasive shell fish which have been introduced to the Great Lakes basin, 
including the Flint River. Zebra mussels can obstruct pipes and water intake screens. A sodium 
permanganate feed system is proposed for zebra mussel control. The project budget is $0.3 
million. 

F. Security Issues 

Additional security measures to guard against malevolent threats or terrorism which target the 
new water source will be required. A project budget for this is $0.3 million. 

G. Pumping System Improvements (Low and High Service Pumps In PS No. 4) 

The pumps are in poor condition and their capacity is not consistent with the projected demands 
of the city. The pumps should be replaced with new, more efficient pumps. The project budget 
for these is $7.8 million. 

H . Filter Transfer Station to Dort Reservoir and UV Inactivation 

Recent IJSF.PA regulations require additional treatment or enhancement of existing treatment 
processes for microbial contaminates such as giardia, Cryptosporidium, viruses, and bacteria, It is 
anticipated that enhanced contact time and ultraviolet light deactivation will be required to 
comply with these new standards. A project budget of $7.0 million is established for compliance 
with the new surface water treatment rules. 

I. Emergency Interconnect 

The GCDC-WWS and City of Flint have a mutual aid agreement providing for each to provide 
the other up to 8 mgd of water as a back-up supply in the event of an emergency with either 
system’s supply. A pumping station and piping interconnect is needed to effectively complete 
this exchange. The project budget for these upgrades is $8.6 million. 

The total of all WTP upgrades above is $49.9 million. 

In addition to upgrades to the treatment plant, there will be increased operating costs associated with 
the continuous operation of the WTP. For comparison with other alternatives for a long-term water 
supply, only the additional operational costs have been determined. 

• Labor - Full scale operation of the WTP and dams on a continuous basis will require additional 
staffing. It is estimated that labor costs will increase by $2,034,000 per year. 

• Chemicals - The cost of chemicals used for water treatment are estimated at $423 per million 
gallons of water produced. 

• Residual Disposal - Disposal costs for lime sludge is estimated to be $453,000 annually. 


Page j 9 



City of Flint 


Analysis of Flint River as Water Supply 


• Power - Increased power costs are estimated to be $ 1 04 per million gallons of water produced. 

• Ozone - Ozone treatment will be needed to meet new treatment standards. A budget of $208,000 
is assumed, 

• Maintenance - Maintenance costs are assumed to be 20% of the O&M budget. Maintenance 
costs of the WTP and other facilities are expected to be relatively high because of the age of the 
facilities. 

XII. Cost Summary 

Upgrades to dams and the WTP will be needed for the Flint River 1 to reliably supply drinking water 
on a continuous basis to Flint’s customers. The cost of these upgrades is presented in the following 
table. Costs have been adjusted to an ENR Construction Cost Index of 8688 to allow for comparison 
with the 2009 Study. It has been assumed that design/construction commenced in 2010, to allow for 
comparison with the alternatives in the 2009 study. 


Tabic 5: Project Costs 

WTP Upgrades $49,888,000 

Hamilton Dam Replacement $7, 1 00,000 

Holloway Dam /Reservoir Upgrades $2,570,000 

Utah Dam Removal $ 1 ,900,000 

Total Capital Cost $61,458,000 

Costs shown are based on upgrades to existing facilities to supply the projected future maximum day 
demand of 18.0 ingd. These upgrades are based on the assumption that the HRMP is modified to 
allow for operation over a greater range of water levels. Other options for supplying the projected 
maximum day demand will result in higher costs. 

Operating costs in the initial year of operation are estimated to increase $7 million above current 
operating costs. Operating costs are projected to increase annually because of inflation and projected 
growth in demand over the study period. 

Figure 1 shows the cost of water for Alternative 3, utilizing the existing WTP and Flint River for 
water supply. The cost of water is comprised of three components: continued purchase of water from 
Detroit during construction, debt for construction of facility upgrades, and ongoing operating costs.

Figure 2 compares the cost of water for all three alternatives. Continued Supply by the City of 
Detroit results in a higher cost for water supply than the other two alternatives. The city’s costs for 
The KWA-New Lake Huron Supply have been based upon the terms of the current KWA Raw Water- 
Supply Contract, and the assumption that the city purchases 18 mgd capacity in the KWA system. 
The KWA alternative is projected to result in the lowest cost for water.

XIII. Implementation 

Planning, design, construction, and start-up will require 52 to 60 months for completion. Additional 
time may be required to address ancillary issues such as modifications to agreements, permits, and 
“non-construction related” environmental issues, 

XIV. Intangibles 

In addition to the upgrades identified for the dams and WTP, other issues will potentially need to be 
addressed if the Flint River is to be used as a water supply. Examples of these include: 

• Environmental impact of work on dams or removal of sediment from the river or reservoirs 

• Impact of construction and reservoir operation on the fishery 

• Impact to recreational users and land owners adjacent to the Holloway Reservoir 

• Potential upgrades to the city’s WWTP if river flows are reduced and stricter effluent limits 
are included in future NPDES permits 

• Impacts of the replacement of the Hamilton Dam at a lower level for improved flood control 
may impact the ability for the WTP to draw water from the river 

• Results of a Source Water Protection Plan which may identify potential threats of 
contamination or other impacts to the water supply 

XV. Summary 

Analysis indicates that the cost of supplying water from the Flint River on a continuous basis will be 
greater than the proposed KWA Raw Water Supply Contract, but less than continued supplied from 
Detroit. Additionally, if the Flint River is to be used for a water supply for city customers, there will 
need to be some modifications to existing facilities, operating agreements, and permits. Upgrades 
will be required at the city’s dams and the water treatment plant to reliably supply water to the city on 
a continuous basis. To meet the future maximum day demand of 18 mgd projected by city staff, one 
or more of the following will be required. 

• Modify the Holloway Dam and Reservoir to provide additional storage 

• Modify the I IRMP to provide for more variance in water levels and/or modify limits on minimum 
discharge 

• Modify the WWTP NPDES permit based on reduced flows in the river and provide resulting 
upgrades to WWTP for higher treatment 

• Provide other raw water storage reservoirs 

Addressing the preceding items is likely to require a great deal of time and effort because of the 
impacts on many other parties. Without making the modifications above, the river is limited to 
supplying a maximum day demand of about 1 1 .6 mgd.

HOLLOWAY RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT PLAN 


GENERAL OBJECTIVE; 

To operate Holloway Dam in a manner that optimises summer recreation on the . 
Holloway Reservoir while preserving downstream usages of the waters of the 
Flint River and assuring availability of a back-up water supply for Flint. 

GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURE: 

Spring Rill - The City of Flint shall operate the dam with the intention of 
capturing a sufficient quantity of spring run-off to maintain the reservoir 
at a minimum elevation of 755 feet no later than May 1 of each year. 

Summer Operation. - The City of Flint shall maintain a minimum outflow of 65 
cf-s until the. level of the reservoir falls to an elevation of 752.7 feet. 

At any time that the level reaches elevation 752-7 feet the city shall 
operate the data such that the outflow does not exceed inflow, on any given 
day, provided, however, that the city shall not be obligated to make more 
than one adjustment to flow during any given day. 

Winter Drawdown. - The City of Flint shall operate the dani to gradually 
drawdown the reservoir during the first two weeks of November to an eleva- 
tion of 751 feet in order to prevent structural damage to the dam from 
freezing. 

Notification - The City of Flint shall provide prior notification to the 
Genesee County Parks and Recreation Commission before making a chaagS' in dam 
operations which result in significant drawdown, ' 


- 1 - 



Maintenance end Construction - Routine maintenance shall be scheduled to 
avoid conflicts with major events and peak usage periods on the reservoir. 

& minimum of 30 days notification shall precede all maintenance and 
construction involving significant drawdown. The Genesee County Parks and 
Recreation Commission shall promptly receive copies of all dam maintenance 
permit applications made by the City of Flint to the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources. 

Gauging of Water Flow into Reservoir - The City of Flint shall be a 
cooperator with the U.S.G.S,. and State of Michigan to establish a stream 
gauge on. the north branch of the Flint River upstream of the Holloway 
Reservoir and be a cooperator on the annual maintenance, and operation of the 
existing gauge on the south branch of the Flint Rivar and the new gauge on 
the north branch of the Flint River. 

EMERGENCIES: . 

In emergency situations affecting public health, safety and welfare

Appendix 3 - Analysis of Adequacy of Flint River as a Water Supply 



Technical Memorandum 

Analysis of Adequacy of Flint River as Water Supply 


1.0 Quantity of Water Required 

Recommended Standards for Water Works, 2003 Edition indicates that the quantity of surface water at 
the source shall: 

« Be adequate to meet the maximum projected water demand of the service area as shown by 
calculations based on a one in fifty year drought or the extreme drought of record, and should 
include consideration of multiple year droughts. Requirements for flows downstream of the 
intake shall comply with requirements of the appropriate reviewing authority. 

• Provide reasonable surplus for anticipated growth 

* Be adequate to compensate for ail losses such as silting, evaporation, seepage, etc. 
o Be adequate to provide ample water for other legal users of the source. 

2.0 Demand Summary 

City staff has indicated the future maximum day demand of the city is 18 mgd. 

in addition to the water used by customers, some water will be required for water treatment processes 
and filter backwash. An allowance for WTP Backwash and Process water of 2 mgd is assumed. 

Water used for fire-fighting is not included in customer demand or sales. An allowance 0.7mgd for 
replenishing water used for fire-fighting is assumed. 

The maximum day demand represents the quantity of water which must be supplied on the particular 
day that the highest use (demand) occurs. Treatment and pumping must be designed to deliver the 
maximum day demand. During peak periods, storage from the Holloway Reservoir can be utilized to 
supplement the natural river flow. For analysis of the river as a source, the maximum month wili be 
used as the demand. 

A review of the city's water demands and precipitation records suggest that maximum month demand is 
about 80% of the maximum day demand. 

The maximum sustained demand to be withdrawn from the river is computed in the following table;

Future Maximum Day Demand (Source Water) 


16.7 mgd 


3.0 Additional Demands and Requirements 

In addition to the demands from Section 2, the following demands must be accounted for: 

3.1 Mutual Aid 

The City and GCDCAWWS have a mutual aid agreement to supply each other water in the event of a 
disruption in supply or other emergency. The agreement provides that the city will supply GCDC-WWS 
up to 8 mgd. 

For this analysis, it is assumed that an emergency will be corrected within 14 days. The volume of water 
that may be required is therefore: 14 days * 8,000,000 gal/day = 112,000,000 gal. This volume wiil be 
reserved from the reservoir volume. 

3.2 Evaporation 

Both the Holloway and Mott dams have been constructed since the drought period of the 1930's, which 
is being used as the base river flow for analysis. Evaporation from the Holloway Reservoir and Mott 
Lake will reduce the amount of available from the river. The NWS publishes an atias which shows 
evaporation rates. Evaporation is primarily a factor during the "growing season"; the atlas shows that 
about 24" of water is lost via evaporation from open water surfaces in Genesee County over the May 
through October period. Loss by evaporation will be offset by the addition of rainfall directly upon the 
water surface. Since the analysis is based upon drought conditions, the low rainfall having a recurrence 
rate of .100 years will be used, During the May through October period, 11.5 inches of rain is estimated 
during the 1 in 100 dry year. The net loss by evaporation Is therefore 12.5 inches. 

The following table summarizes the loss by evaporation, over the six month period from May through 
October.

3.3 Siltation 

The July 2001 Flint River Assessment completed by the MDNR indicates that sedimentation occurs in the 
Holloway Reservoir at an accelerated rate, but does not provide quantities. Measurements of the silt 
accumulation in the reservoir have not been completed. Accumulations of several feet have occurred in 
other reservoirs. Sedimentation of an average of 1 foot across the Holloway Reservoir will result in the 
loss of 643,000,000 gaiions of storage, or about ten percent of the total volume available. 

Mott Lake is not used as a water storage reservoir, its level Is controlled by a fixed weir. Although 
siltation likely occurs in Mott Lake too, it has no impact on storage for water supply. 

3.4 Seepage 

Seepage is not believed to have a significant impact on the availability of water at the WTP. Seepage 
through the embankments of either the Holloway or Mott dams or through the bottom of the reservoirs 
seems likely to migrate back to the Flint River, although perhaps downstream of the reservoirs, prior to 
the WTP. 

3.5 Flint WWTP 

The City's WWTP discharges treated wastewater to the Flint River. The NPDES permit issued to the 
WWTP has established limits for the treated effluent, based on a drought flow In the river of at least 85 
cfs. 

3.6 Holloway Reservoir Management Plan 

In 1977 the City and Genesee County executed the Holloway Reservoir Management Plan [HRMP) which 
established parameters for the operation of the dam and reservoir. In 1977, water was no longer 
withdrawn from the river for water supply and the HRMP appears to have been developed to address 
four primary issues: 

<* Availability to utilize the reservoir for water supply as a backup or alternative supply 
» Provide for physical maintenance of the dam 
o Provide for the recreational use of the reservoir 
® Provide flow augmentation to Flint WWTP 


ROWE Professional 

p n fi Services Company j u i y 2011 




The HRMP establishes a summer operating level of 755 and a winter level 751. The summer level 
maximizes the volume of water available during the dry period in the event that the river is to be used 
as a water supply. The higher level also supports recreational activities on the reservoir. The 751 winter 
level provides protection against damage from freezing during the winter. The HRMP establishes a 
minimum discharge of 65 cfs from the dam, presumably to provide a minimum flow of 85 cfs in the river 
at the WWTP. 

4.0 Analysis 

It is assumed that the demands and other requirements identified above are to be maintained in the 
event that water is withdrawn from the Flint River for water supply. In 1963, USGS published Water 
Resources Flint Area Michigan, which includes an analysis of the river as a water supply. This publication 
includes design information regarding the Holloway Reservoir and its operation for wafer supply. 

In 1977 when the HRMP was executed, water was not withdrawn from the river for water supply, If the 
HRMP required a minimum discharge of 65 cfs at the Holloway Dam to provide for adequate flow in the 
river at the WWTP, the minimum discharge from the Holloway Dam should be increased by the amount 
of water withdrawn for water supply if the current river flow at the WWTP is to be maintained. 

65 cfs + 16.7 mgd (25.8 cfs) ~ 90.8 cfs (58.7 rngd) 

Figure 1 shows the sustained discharge which can be maintained from the Holloway Reservoir during a 
drought period. This graph is based on USGS records of flow in the river between 1930 and 1952. This 
period includes the drought period of 1930 to 1937, which is USGS considers the most severe drought: in 
Michigan history, having a recurrence period of 1 even/ 50 to 70 years. This period was prior to the 
construction of Hoiloway Dam, so river records reflect the natural flow of the river without impact by 
dam operations.

Figure 1 indicates that about 6,2 billion gallons of storage is needed to maintain a sustained discharge of 
58.6 mgd from the reservoir to provide the minimum river flow of 85 cfs at the WWTP. 

In addition to the 6.2 billion gallons of storage, additional storage is required to provide GCDC-WWS an 
emergency supply and to make up for reservoir loss by evaporation. 


Table 3: Storage Requirements to Maintain Current Conditions plus Water Supply 


Storage to meet sustained demand and WWTP fiow:

For this analysis, it is assumed that storage is available from the Holioway Reservoir to supplement the 
natural river flow. 


* The Holloway Reservoir was designed to provide storage for water supply in the 1950's 

« The Mott Dam is a fixed weir, so storage is not available, The dam is owned by the Genesee 

county Parks Department and provides recreational benefit, 

« The Hamilton Dam impoundment is iimited to the river channel; storage volume is negligible. 
■ The Utah Dam is inoperable. 



ROWE Professional 
Services Company 


July 2011 







« The Kearsley Dam is not directly located on the Flint River, but on the Kearsley Creek just prior 
to its confluence with the Flint River. The Kearsley Creek discharges to the Flint River 
downstream of the City's WTP so storage from the river is not available for water supply; 
however, discharge from the Kearsley dam can be used to supplement downstream river flows, 
including the flow in the river at the WWTP, The Kearsley Reservoir can provide a maximum of 
650 million gallons of storage. 

« The Thread Lake Dam Is not located on the Flint River, but the Thread Creek discharges into the 
Swartz Creek which discharges into the Flint River just west of the downtown area. The Thread 
Lake dam provides a maximum storage volume of 100 million gallons of storage. Discharge from 
the Thread Lake dam could be used to supplement downstream river flows, but not for water 
supply. 

• For this analysis, storage from neither the Kearsley Reservoir nor Thread Lake is included. Both 
dams were constructed prior the Holloway Reservoir and discharges from the Kearsley Dam and 
Thread Lake Dam are assumed to be included in the analysis presented in the USGS publication. 

Following is a capacity curve for the Holloway Reservoir, from the USGS Water Resou rces F lint Area - 

Figure 2: Holloway Reservoir Storage Capacity (excerpt from USGS Water Resources Flint Area 

Michiganl 



Figure 2 indicates that a Holloway Reservoir level of 758,0 feet provides storage of 7.85 billion gallons. 

Review of design drawings of the Holloway Dam indicates that the dam was designed to use drum gates 
to maintain the normal water level(s) of the reservoir. The drum gates can rotate to allow for reservoir 
levels ranging from a low level of 751 feet to a high level of 755 feet. If the reservoir is to be maintained 


/^pgfcy ROWE Professional 
Services Company 


July 2011 






at a higher level than the current summer level of 755 feet, modifications will be required to the drum 
gates. 

According to the original dam design drawings, the dam embankment was constructed to elevation 763 
feet (however, the USGS reports shows the top elevation as 760 feet). If the reservoir level is raised to 
7S8 feet, only about five feet of freeboard will be provided to guard against overtopping. There are 
three concerns regarding increasing the reservoir level from 755 to 758 feet. 

The Increased hydraulic pressure resulting from the higher water level on one side of the dam will result 
in increased seepage through the embankment, and a reduction in its integrity. 

The reservoir has a fetch of about three miles east from the dam. Figure 3 shows that a 37 mph wind 
sustained for one hour duration from the east can result in waves capable of two feet. The original 
design drawings show rip rap armoring on the reservoir side of the dam embankment to an elevation of 
757 feet. Rip-rap armoring should be extended to at least two feet higher than the 758 feet level to 
protect against wave action.

The reservoir is tributary to a large watershed. There have been rapid increases in river flow (and 
reservoir level) soon after intense rain events in the watershed, A rain storm in June 1996 resulted in a 
1.62 foot increase in the water level of the reservoir resulting in the opening of dam gates and discharge 
of 7,740 cfs. Reducing the freeboard also reduces the volume available for flood management.

GENESEE COUNTY, MICHIGAN 

2.0 Conclusions and Recommendations 


The Holloway Dam was inspected on October 19, 200B in accordance with Michigan P.A. 451, 
Part 315 criteria- The dam, including spillway and embankments was found to be in good 
condition. A summary of comments/recoinmendations is as follows: 

1. The City of Flint should continue their operation and maintenance procedures as 
outlined in the “Holloway Reservoir Operation and Maintenance Plan". 

2. The Emergency Action Plan should be exercised annually and Notification List 
concurrently updated. 

3. Small brush should be removed from the left and right embankments. 

4. Minor spalls and cracks in the spillway concrete should be monitored. These do not 
require immediate correction, but should be planned and budgeted in the City's long 
term Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). 

5. The seepage monitoring weirs should be placed back into operation by repairing the 
eroded channel. Periodic observations of seepage rates and observed fines 
deposition should be performed and logged for long term data comparison, 

6. Warning signs on the concrete abutments should be re-painted. 

7. The security fence in the downstream right embankment should be repaired. 

8. Monitor the sioughed area in the downstream right embankment and repair as 
needed. 

9. Further inspections should be performed in accordance with P.A. 451, Part 315 
regulations.

GENESEE COUNTY, MICHIGAN 

3.0 Project Information 


The Holloway Dam is located on the Flint River in Richfield Township, Genesee County, 
Michigan (Section 11, T8N, R5E). The dam and lower one fourth of the reservoir are in 
Genesee County while the upper three fourths of the reservoir are in Lapeer County, The dam 
was built in 1954 to maintain a base flow in the Flint River for water supply and sewage dilution 
requirements. The Holloway Dam was previously referred to as the Richfield Storage Dam. 
Presently the reservoirs uses are primarily, base water flow implementation, sewage dilution 
and recreation. The dam consists of earth embankments and a 248 ft long gated concrete 
spillway structure. The total length of the dam is approximately 3,350 ft between the natural 
moraine banks. The top of the embankment serves as a gravel road for maintenance purposes. 
A steel framed walkway spans the top of the spillway structure for operation and maintenance of 
the gates. The embankment side slopes are 3 horizontal to 1 vertical on the upstream face and 
2 horizontal to 1 vertical on the downstream face. 

3.1 PERTINENT DATA 

The embankment /s comprised of two zones: an upstream section and key trench of compacted 
impervious clay; and a larger downstream section of essentially granular material, 
predominantly sand with some gravel. 

The plans show a sheet pile cutoff wall along the full length of the dam near the upstream toe, 
extending 23 ft below the base of the embankment and two feet into the embankment. A 
subdrain system, originating just downstream of the centerline of the crest and transverse to the 
dam axis, is also shown. The plans indicate that this subdrain system is formed by tile drain 
pipes with a center-to-center drain spacing of 15 ft. Plan details indicate a graded filter 
surrounding the tile drain pipes. The pipes empty into a collection ditch at the toe of the 
downstream slope. The right embankment has been modified by installation of fill at the toe 
with a bench located mid point on the slope. Weep drains were extended with 6” PVC pipe. 

The outlet works of the dam consist of a reinforced concrete spillway controlled by seven gates. 
There is a control house on each end of the spillway, A telemark water level recording gage is 
in the left control house. 

The following is a tabulation of principal data obtained from the construction drawings. 

Hazard Classification - High (per 1978 USACE report}. 

Length of Dam - Overall length of the dam including the concrete spillway structure and the 
right and left embankments is approximately 3,350 ft.

4.0 Field inspection 


An inspection of the facilities was performed by Dana M. Dougherty, PE (Stantec) on October 
19, 2008. The weather on the date of inspection was clear wilh temperature at approximately 
55°F. The impoundment elevation was near normal (summer) i.e, 755. Flow was passing over 
the drum gates as well as through the left (looking downstream) sluicegate. 

The following items were noted: (Referenced photographs can be found in Appendix G.) 

4.1 SPILLWAY 

Overall the spillway appeared to be in excellent condition. Recent preventative maintenance 
work includes painting of miscellaneous metals including handrails, gates, and support beams, 
installation of new galvanized steel grating on the gate operator platform and patching concrete 
at the upper downstream end of the taintor gate piers. 

Some minor items were noted with regard to concrete condition including: 

1. There was spalled concrete on the top of the upstream right wingwaii. The face of 
the wail exhibited cracking and efflorescence at this location (Ref. Photos #3 and 
#4). 

2. There was a small crack in the right abutment immediately above the drum gate. 
There is no evidence of movement or displacement at this crack (Ref. Photo #6). 
This should be monitored. 

3. Minor alligator cracking was noted in the taintor gate piers (Ref. Photos #7 and #8). 
These do not pose any immediate concern but should be monitored. 

4. There were cracks in the left abutment and left downstream retaining wails. No 
displacement was noted. These cracks should be monitored for future movement 
(Ref. Photos #9 and #10). 

5. The upper portion of the downstream end Of the left downstream retaining wall has 
alligator cracking and effervescence. This should be monitored (Ref. Photo #12). 

6. The warning signs that are painted on the upstream abutment/wingwall faces are 
faded and difficult to read. These should be repainted. 

4.2 RIGHT EMBANKMENT 

Overall the condition of the right embankment appears to be good with no significant erosion, 
seepage, settlement, sloughing or animal burrows noted. The following specific items were 
noted:

| 1. There was a minor amount of erosion beneath the riprap on the upstream 

i embankment face immediately adjacent to the spillway. 

S. 2. Some brush has begun to grow on the upstream slope. This should be selectively 

removed (Ref Photos #14 and #16). Small natural growth such as wildflowers and 
grasses should remain. 

3. Considerable brush was observed on the downstream embankment face and within 

; the toe-of-slope drain. This should be removed (Ref, Photos #1? and #20). 

4. For the most part weep tiles are dry. There is one section midway in the 

> embankment where the weep tiles are active. Some sloughing of the sfope was 

i observed in this area. It appeared that this has been addressed through addition of 

a blanket drain with geotextiie fabric. This should be monitored for further 
displacement. 

? 5. A short section of the security fence was in disrepair. This should be corrected (Ref. 

Photo #23). 

6. The seepage monitoring weir is not functioning. Flow was passing around the weir 
through an eroded section. This should be corrected (Ref. Photo #24). 

i 4.3 LEFT EMBANKMENT 

The observed condition of the left embankment was good to excellent. There was no evidence 
of significant erosion, seepage, settlement, sloughing or animal burrows. The following specific 
; items were noted: 

1. A minor amount of small brush should be removed from the downstream slope (Ref. 
i Photo #28).

5.0 Structural Stability 


The assessment of stability is based on visual observations made during our field inspection 
(10/19/08). 

No deficiencies were noted that would impact the structural integrity of the dam; however minor 
items were noted that should be proactively addressed to miiigate potential future deficiencies. 
Over all the condition of the facility remains good.

6.0 Hydrology and Hydraulics 


The MDEQ has estimated the required spillway capacity at the Hotioway Dam to be 9900 cfs 
(reference Appendix B). This equates to the 200 year frequency flood which is mandated by 
statute -P. A. 451, Part 315, Section 324.31516. 

Headwater rating curves previously produced by the USACE (1978) and Acres international 
(1993) indicate that this discharge capacity can be met at an impoundment elevation of 
approximately 755. This would allow for approximately 8 feet of freeboard. Thus/the spillway 
discharge capacity is sufficient to meet P.A. 451, Part 315 requirements. Furthermore, the 
spiilway capacity at overtopping (Ei. 763) is approximately 40,000 cfs or Vz PMF. 

The spillway capacity has also been determined with the assumption that the drum gates fail to 
operate and are locked in the up position (reference Ayres, Lewis, Norris & May, Inc. (ALNM) 
Report - 1996). The resultant 200 year impoundment elevation is computed to be 
approximately 761 or two feet of freeboard. Therefore, the required spillway design capacity 
can be met through operation of the taintor gates only.

7,0 Operation and Maintenance 


The dam is operated and maintained by staff from the City of Flint Water Treatment Riant. 
Routine operation and maintenance is performed in accordance with the Holloway Reservoir 
Operation and Maintenance Plan which is on file at the City of Flint WTP. 

Impoundment elevation is continuously monitored via an on-site level transducer. 
Instantaneous level information is available remotely to assist operations personnel in 
maintenance of the impoundment elevation, 

During summer months, the drum gates are in a raised position and taintor gates closed. The 
impoundment elevation is maintained between 755.0 and 755.75 by operating the drum and/or 
taintor gates as needed. 

The impoundment elevation is lowered in the winter to approximately elevation 751.0. The 
drum gates are lowered during this period. 

Emergency backup power is available to operate the taintor gates in case of a power loss. An 
Auxiliary Generator Power System Report is available at the WTP. 

The City has performed routine maintenance of the facilities on an "as needed" basis. The most 
recent work consisted of painting exposed steel components including the taintor gates and 
access platform support steel. 

In addition to routine surveillance by operations staff, supervisor staff also performs an annual 
inspection of the facilities. Noted deficiencies are scheduled for correction the following year.

2.0 Conclusions and Recommendations 


The Utah Dam was inspected on October 19, 2008 in accordance with Michigan P.A. 451, Part 
315 criteria. The dam was found to be in fair to poor condition. A summary of 
comments/recommendations is as follows: 

1. The stability of the exposed portion or the structure is poor and is no longer capable 
of serving its intended purpose, 

2 . The operating components of the facility (floodgates) have been decommissioned for 
sometime and are no longer functional. 

3. The purpose of the dam (impound water for (he upstream water treatment plant) is 
no longer needed as the Hamilton Dam, which is located downstream, provides this 
capability. 

4. The Hamilton Dam is currently being evaluated for potential reconstruction and 
should the decision be made to proceed with that project the Utah Dam will serve no 
useful future function. 

5. The spillway hydraulic capacity is deficient with regard to P.A. 451 , Part 315, Section 
324,31516 rules. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the partially open gates 
impede high flows resulting in an increased backwater, 

6. The City should consider full or partial removal of the dam. It is possible that the 
foundation and submerged portion of the piers may be reused to support a new 
pedestrian crossing bridge. The minimum removal effort would consist of removing 
the gates from the dam. Due to the aforementioned deficiencies and related public 
safety liabilities the City should take immediate action perhaps concurrent with the 
proposed Hamilton Dam reconstruction.

3,0 Project information 


Utah Dam is located on the Flint River in the City of Flint, Genesee County, Michigan {T08N, 
R07E, Section 32) at the south end of Whaley Park. The site location map is shown in 
Appendix A, 

Utah Dam is owned by the City of Flint and plans for the dam are on file with the City. It was 
designed by the Ambursen Dam Company of New York and San Francisco and built around 
1928. The dam was constructed to maintain a reservoir at El. 711 to provide sufficient head on 
the City's water treatment plant intake pipe. The pool created by the dam was limited to the 
main channel of the Flint River. The dam was built between the two banks of the river and has 
a total length of 240 ft. It consists of a concrete gravity structure with six spillway bays and 4 ft 
wide piers. Each bay has a 12 ft high by 25 ft long vertical lift gate. 

There are two bridge decks on the structure. The upper deck is approximately 1 1 ft wide and It 
is used to move the gate hoist along the length of the dam. The gate hoist travels the length of 
the dam on two No. 40 rails, each of which is supported by 15 inch 'T beams. The beams arc 
supported by the piers. 

The lower bridge deck is separated by the vertical lift gates, The downstream side of the deck 
is 7 ft wide and it serves as a pedestrian waikway. The upstream side of the deck is 5 ft wide 
and it is used by the operator to gain access to the upper deck via a steel ladder. 

Presently, the dam serves as a walkway over the Flint River and as a backup for Hamilton dam 
for providing a head on the water intake pipe. The gates of Utah Dam are currently locked open 
above the normal backwater elevation created by Hamilton Dam, which is 2.2 miles 
downstream. Elevations given In this report are referenced to National Geodetic Vertical 
Datum. 

Six spillway bays and vertical lift gates are contained within the structure. Pertinent data about 
Utah Dam is give below. 

Height of Dam - The total height of the dam, defined in P.A. 451, Part 315 as the difference in 
elevation between the natural stream bed (Ei. 696.8 ft) and the design flood elevation (El. 717.2 
ft) is approximately 20.4 ft. 

Crest Width of Structure - 30 ft as measured along the lower deck. 

Sill of Vertical Lift Gates - Ei. 697,3 ft. 

Sketches of the dam are included in Appendix A.

4.0 Fieki inspection 


An inspection of the facilities was performed by Dana M. Dougherty, P.E. (Stantec) on October 
19, 2008. The weather on the date of inspection was dear with temperature at approximately 
55°F. The impoundment elevation was approximately 1.9 ft beiow normal elevation. The City 
was in the process of lowering the Hamilton Dam impoundment per directive from the MDEQ. 
This directive requires that the Hamilton Dam impoundment be iowered 3.25 ft. 

The following items were noted {Reference photographs can be found in Appendix C): 

1. The concrete condition on the downstream face of the dam is fair to poor. The right 
downstream retaining wa!i shows significant spalling in its top and outside corner. 
The le ft downstream retaining wall has significant spalling and cracking. The pier 
noses (three of five) are spalied. The access platform or walkway or the darn, 
concrete is in fair to poor condition. There is effervescence and cracking in the 
access platform support beams. There is no displacement. (Ref. Photos #1 and #5.) 

2. The concrete condition of the upstream dam face is fair to poor. The noses of all 
piers show effervescence and some alligator cracking. This is also true for the right 
and left upstream retaining walls. There does not appear to be any substantial 
structural cracking in any of these members or displacement. There is spalling of 
concrete at the top of the piers as well as at the top of the abutment walls where the 
access platform rests. There is also some indication of spalling in the access 
platform beams and in some cases at the bottom of the beams themselves (Ref. 
Photos #2 and #6). 

3, The gates are randomly open. The left gate, Bay No. 1 , is 2 feet above the water 
level on this date. Bay No. 2 and No. 3 from the left, are 4 feet above water level on 
this date and Bay No. 4, 5, and 6 are 6.5 feet above water level. All dimensions 
reference water level to the bottom of the gate. 

4, The superstructure appears to be in very poor condition, Concrete is in fair to poor 
condition. The operating platform, which housed a single moveable gantry crane for 
all six gates, has spalling in the beams as well as the piers. Protective railings are ail 
intact, but in poor condition and require painting (Ref. Photos #7 and #8), 

5, The top of the right embankment has a paved walkway with chain link fence on eilher 
side of the walkway. This is also true for the left embankment. There is also lighting 
at the site, utility poles in each embankment with a light fixture (Ref. Photos #3 and 
#4). 

6. The embankments have some tree growth which should be removed.

7, On the date of the inspection, the water level is about 10,6 feet below the 
operating/wa'Kway platform (El. 706,6 NGVD), 

8. There is a 4 foot wide opening in the fence on the left downstream face of the dam, 
next to the utility pole, which allows access and is a safety issue. Also, the safety 
fencing that was installed on the upstream side of the dam, between the walkway 
and the gates, has been removed and is a safety issue.

5.0 Structural Stability 


The assessment of stability is based on visual observations made during our field inspection 
( 10 / 10 / 08 ). 

The overall structural condition of the Utah Dam is categorized to be fair to poor. Substantia! 
deteriorated concrete is evident with numerous spalls, cracks, and some exposed reinforcing 
steel. The superstructure concrete is in the poorest condition with the gate lift support structure 
no longer capable of supporting its intended function t.e. gate operation. 

The condition of the access platforms and exposed portions of the piers is somewhat better than 
the superstructure but still would be categorized as poor. The submerged portion of the peirs 
and foundation were not inspected as part of this report, however experience with similar 
structures would imply that their condition would be better than the exposed components. 

In conclusion, the Utah Dam structural stability will no longer support gate operation. 
Furthermore, continued use of the access platforms for pedestrian crossing will be dependent 
on future evaluation, repair and/or modification of those components.

6.0 Hydrology and Hydraulics 


The MDEQ has established the required spillway capacity at the Utah Dam to be 11,800 cfs 
(reference Appendix B). This equates to the 100 year frequency ffood which is mandated by 
statute, P.A. 451, Part 315, Section 324.31516, for dams classified as low hazard such as the 
Utah Dam. 

The hydraulic capacity of the Utah Darn is greatly impacted by the downstream Hamilton Dam, 
The norma! impoundment elevation of the Hamilton Dam impoundment is approximately El. 
708.0 (NGVD) while the gate sil! elevation of the Utah Dam is 697.3. Thus, the Utah Dam is 
partially submerged under norma! conditions. 

Overtopping of the right embankment occurs at or near Et. 714.0. The 1993 Acres Report 
(Appendix B) indicates that overtopping of this embankment will be experienced at flows over 
7,830 cfs. The FEMA Flood Insurance Study (Appendix B) shows the 100 year flood elevation 
at the Utah Dam to be approximately EL 716.0. Thus the right embankment is overtopped 
under high flow conditions due to backwater impacts from the Hamilton Dam. It should be noted 
that the FEMA Flood Insurance Study assumes that ali six gates are operable at Hamilton Dam, 
Since 1991 only three gates have been operable thus the backwater impact would be greater 
than shown on the FEMA maps. 

The Utah Dam’s hydrautic capacity is further diminished by the fact that the floodgates are 
currently locked in a partially open position. The bottom of gate elevation for each bay 
(numbered left to right locking downstream) is approximately: 


Bay No. 1 

708.5 

Bays No. 2 and 3 

710.5 

Bays No. 4 through 6 

713.0 


Under high flows (100 year El. 716.0) the gates will impede flow thereby further exacerbating 
flood conditions. 

For the above described reasons, it is concluded that the Utah Dam does not meet spillway 
capacity requirements as required by statute.

7.0 Operation and Maintenance 


The Utah Dam is operated and maintained by staff from the City of Flint Water Treatment Plant. 
The floodgates are currently nonfunctional and are locked in a partially open position. Power 
has been disconnected from the gate operators. The impoundment elevation is maintained by 
the downstream Hamilton Dam thereby negating the usefulness of the Utah Dam. 

The City staff therefore maintains a minima! surveillance effort at the dam. Minima) preventative 
maintenance has been performed in the recenl past. It is the City's intent to remove ail or a 
portion of the structure as funds become available. Until that time maintenance will be limited to 
those items necessary to insure public safety with regard to the pedestrian bridge crossing.

2,0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 


The Hamilton Darn was inspected on October 19, 2008 in accordance with the Michigan PA 
415, Part 315 criteria. The dam was found to be in poor condition which supports the 
conciusion found in previous dam safety reports. Specific comments/recommendations are as 
follows: 

1. The stability of the exposed structural components including gate piers, access and 
operating platforms, and abutments is poor. These components are no longer 
capable of serving their intended purpose. 

2. Three of the floodgates have been decommissioned while the reliability of the 
remaining gates is suspect. With three gates operating inadequate freeboard exists 
at the right embankment (looking downstream). In addition upstream flood 
elevations will be greater than those included in the FMEA Flood Insurance maps. 

3. The MDEQ mandated drawdown should be adhered to until the dam is 
reconstructed. 

4. The City should proceed immediately to implement the preferred option from the 
2008 Reconstruction Feasibility Study. 

5. In the interim, the City should exercise the Emergency Action Plan (EAR) annually to 
insure an efficient implementation when and if needed.

HAMILTON DAM 

CITY OF FLINT 

GENESEE COUNTY, MICHIGAN 

3.0 PROJECT INFORMATION 


Hamilton Dam is located on the Flint River in downtown Flint, Michigan near the Flint Branch of 
the University of Michigan campus, and approximately 800 ft. upstream from the Saginaw Street 
Bridge. 

Plans for the current dam are on file with the City of Flint, but original design data is not 
available. The dam was designed by Fargo Engineering Company of Jackson, Michigan, and 
was constructed about 1920 by Price Brothers Company of Lansing, Michigan on the site of a 
previous miff dam. The dam was constructed to sustain a head for the upstream water 
treatment plant intake. 

The existing structure is a reinforced concrete gravity dam with six gated spillway bays. Each 
bay has a tainter gate on the fixed crest of a concrete spillway. The six bays, each 33 ft. long, 
and the five piers, each four feet thick, make a total length of 218 ft. There is an end sill below 
the spillway and an 18 ft. concrete apron beyond the end sill. The gates are operated during 
flood flows. 

The original 1920 dam had seven bays with tainter gates. In 1964, the southern (left) most 
gate, its spillway and headrace were removed. 

A fish ladder was constructed through the right abutment sidewalls in 1978. Also in 1978, the 
right concrete abutment was modified to install an Archimedean screw pump. 

Repairs to Hamilton Dam were carried out in the summer of 1992. Steel sheet piling was 
placed just upstream of the gates for Bays 1, 2 and 6 because of the deteriorated condition of 
the gates. The sheet piles were to maintain the headpond in case of gate failure. The top 
elevation of the sheet piles was placed near the top of the tainter gates (Elev. 707.8 ft,) in a 
closed position, Gate repairs were completed in Bays 3, A, and 5. These repairs included the 
complete removal of the existing gates and replacement with new gates, repair of buttress and 
sill concrete, repair of gate trunnions, replacement of lift chains, and painting of ali exposed gate 
steel. 

The top deck of the structure is divided lengthwise into a pedestrian walkway and the gate hoist 
rails for the two gate hoists. The hoist rails consist of two T beams (18 inch and 15 inch) that 
are supported by the piers. The two hoists for raising the spillway tainter gates are driven by 
attached electric motors. 

A U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's bronze disk is set flush with the bridge deck in the walkway at 
the second pier from the right end. Unless otherwise noted, data given in this report is based on 
the assumption that the El 715.06 ft. elevation given for this benchmark is on National Geodetic 
Vertical Datum (NGVD).

PROJECT INFORMATION 
December 2008 


The terrain near the dam and reservoir is urban and gentiy rolling. Five borings from the original 
plans show sand with an occasional pocket of clay or gravel in the soils overlying a soft 
sandstone which is 40 or 50 ft. below ground surface. 

Six spillway bays and tainter gates make up the structure. Only Gates 3, 4 and 5 are currently 
operable. Sketches and pertinent data about Hamilton Dam are shown in Appendix A. 

Hamilton Dam was classified by the U.S, Army Corp of Engineers as High Hazard in the 1S80 
Phase i Inspection Report. This classification remains in effect to date. 

Plans for the original Dam construction in 1920 and plans for repairs performed in 1992 are on 
file with the City of Fiint. Past inspection reports on file include the following:

PROJECT INFORMATION 
December 2008 


Department of Environmental Quality issued an order to the City of Flint to drawdown the 
Hamilton impoundment 3.25 ft. to an elevation not greater than 705.25 NGVD for the purpose of 
public health, welfare and safety protection. The depth of necessary drawdown was computed 
by the M0EQ to eliminate the danger of loss of life downstream in the event of a sudden dam 
failure. 

A permit under Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams was issued for this activity on September 
30, 2008. The City of Flint has subsequently abided by the conditions of this permit and has 
lowered the normal impoundment elevation to the prescribed elevation, it should also be noted 
that the MDEQ. permit requires permanent deflation of the Obermeyer (Inflatable) Dam.

4,0 FIELD INSPECTION 


An inspection of the facilities was performed on October 19, 2008 by Dana M. Dougherty, PE. 
The weather on the date of the inspection was clear with temperatures at approximately 55‘F. 
The impoundment elevation was below normal by approximately 1.5 ft. The City was in the 
process of lowering the impoundment per directive from the MDEG, This directive requires that 
the impoundment be lowered 3.25 ft. The floodgate in Bay #3 has been opened to accomplish 
this task. 

The following items were noted during the field inspection (referenced photographs can be 
found in Appendix C): 

1 . The condition of the exposed concrete including piers, slabs, abutments is poor with 
numerous spalls, cracks and exposed reinforcing steel (Ref. Photos #1 through #4, 
#7, #8, #10). 

2. The floodgates in Bays 1, 2 and 6 have been decommissioned by placement of steel 
sheeting across the face of these bays (Ref. Photos #2 and #8). 

3. The City reports that the remaining floodgates (Bays 3 through 5) are operative, 
however, Bays 4 and 5 have not been operated with any frequency and thus their 
reliability is suspect. 

4 . The access waikway/platform remains closed to the public due to safety concerns 
(Ref. Photos #3 and #4). 

5. Overall the condition of the dam continues to worsen with the structural integrity of 
numerous components compromised.

5.0 STRUCTURAL STABILITY 


The assessment of stability is based on a visual observation made during our field inspection 
(10/19/08) and visual observations made during preparation of the 2008 Reconstruction 
Feasibility Study, as well as the 1989 condition survey (concrete corings). 

The overall structural condition of the Hamilton Oam is poor. Exposed surfaces including gate 
piers, access and operating platforms and abutments all exhibit conditions that indicate these 
components have exceeded their useful life. Numerous spalls, cracks and exposed reinforcing 
steel exist. 

In conclusion, the Hamilton Dam structural stability is deficient and thus this facility represents a 
potential liabifity with regard to public health, welfare and safety.

GENESEE COUNTY, MICHIGAN 

6.0 HYDROLOGY AND HYDRAULICS 


The dam is regulated under State of Michigan P.A. 451 Part 315 statute. Guidelines that 
accompany this statute require high hazard potential dams with heights less than 40 ft. to be 
capable of passing a 200-year flood or the flood of record whichever is greater. For the 
Hamilton Dam, the 200-year flood controls and has been computed by the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality to be 13,000 cfs (reference Appendix B), 

The computed maximum impoundment elevation for the 200-year flood event varies dependent 
on assumptions made with regard to the number of floodgates that are operative. In 1981, 
calculations were performed by the United States Geologic Survey and form the basis for the 
FEMA Flood Insurance mapping that is used to this day. The USGS assumed that all six 
floodgates were operational, The USACE also computed the maximum impoundment elevation 
in their 1981 National Dam Safety Inspection Report. They assumed that just two gates were 
operational due to the fact that the gates could not be locked in an open position and only two 
operators existed. In 1993 after decommissioning of Gates 1, 2 and 6, Acres International 
Corporation computed the maximum headwater elevation assuming that gates were operational 
in Bays 3, 4 and 5. 

The results of these various studies is as follows (refer to Appendix B for more information):

* USGS added 0.95' to I he computed impoundment elevation for the purpose of floodplain mapping. Therefore the floodplain 
mapping indicates a 200-year Hood elevation of approximately 710.0 NGVD. 


It should be noted that there is uncertainty as to whether or not adequate freeboard exists at this 
site. The Acres report indicates that freeboard is sufficient based on the fact that the upstream 
right streambank area was raised in the mid 1980's. However, a recent survey conducted as 
part of the 2008 Reconstruction Feasibility Study indicates the elevation of this area to be 
similar to that shown in the 1981 USACE report i,e. + 711.5 NGVD. Thus, it would appear that 
inadequate freeboard currently exists.

7.0 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE 


The Hamilton Dam is operated and maintained by staff from the City of Flint Water Treatment 
Plant. Floodgates in Bays 1, 2 and 6 are currently non-functional. Floodgates in the remaining 
bays can be operated, however their reliability is diminished due to the deteriorated condition of 
the operating slab. 

City staff maintains the impoundment elevation by operating the gates on an as needed basis. 
The impoundment is currently being maintained at the MDEQ mandated level of 705.25 NGVD 
i.e. 3.25 ft below normal. 

The City has performed minimal maintenance to the structure in anticipation of reconstruction.

Appendix 8 - Cost of Service Study - Flint Water Treatment Plant 



Technical Memorandum 
Cost of Service Study 
Flint Water Treatment Plant 



I. Introduction 

This Technical Memorandum describes the proposed improvements needed at the Flint Water Plant to 
treat Flint River water on a continuous basis. The primary foundations tor this evaluation were the 
"Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation — Phase IP' report dated December 2003 and the "Preliminary 
Engineering Report, Lake Huron Water Supply, Karegnondi Water Authority" dated September 2009, 

The findings, as presented in the following sections, address the improvements required for the water 
plant to produce finished water in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water 
regulations. In addition, operation and maintenance costs for continuous operation have been evaluated 
and included in order to determine the total cost associated with using the Flint River as a source of 
water. 

Improvements, as proposed in this evaluation, along with those previously made during the Phase ! 
improvements program, will produce a finished water quality equal to the current water quality as 
received from the QWSD. The design parameters are as follows: 

1) Minimum Day Demand — 10-mgd 

Average Day Demand — t5-mgd (14-mgd in 2010 increasing to 15-mgd in 2050} 
Maximum Day Demand - 28-mgd 

2} Turbidity - 0.20 NTU 

3) Hardness — 80 to 100 mg/I as CaCOj 

4) Cryptosporidium — 3-Log Inactivation 

5) Giardia — >3-Log Inactivation 

6) Viruses — >4-Log Inactivation 

7) Taste and Odor - Eliminated with pre-ozonation 

8) Trihalomethanes - Less than 80 pg/l 

9) HAAS — Less than 60 pg/l 

As part of this investigation, an inspection of the Flint Water Plant was performed on May 3, 2011. The 
purpose of this inspection was to determine if the recommendations in the Phase il report, as referenced 
above, needed to be revised due to changed conditions or water supply needs. Based on findings from 
this meeting, the major adjustment to be made is the reduction of average day demand from 20-mgd to 
14-mgd and maximum day demand being reduced from 36-mgd to 28-mgd. Required improvements as 
recommended in this study have taken these new demands into account. The conceptual design of these 
new facilities would allow cost effective expansion to 36-mgd, as needed, to meet future demands. 


II. Required Capital Improvements 

The following describes the required improvements as required for the Flint Water Plant to operate on a 
continual basis using the Flint River as a water source. Most of these improvements are more fully 
described in the Phase II report and are not repeated to avoid duplicative effort.

A, 


Lime Sludge Disposal 


Lime sludge is proposed to be pumped from the east and west softening basins to two new 42 -ft diameter 
thickeners (25-ft SWD) located adjacent to the plate settling building. Decant from the thickener will 
flow by gravity to the primary clarifier influent channel. Thickened sludge (12% solids) will be pumped 
to a new plate-and-frame filter press located at the north end of the WTP 1 primary settling basin. A new 
two-story building would be constructed at that location to house the pumping facilities and presses. 

Each press, located on the second floor, will have a 225-cf per hour capacity and will drop the 
dewatered sludge into a first floor bunker area. The dewatered cake will be transferred to a lime storage 
concrete bunker located approximately 60 feet north of the sludge press building. The storage bunker 
{100-i't x 192 -ft) will have the capacity to store three to four months of dewatered lime sludge cake. 

About every three months, contract haulers will remove the lime sludge and place on agricultural lands 
that are permitted for final disposal, 


The capacities of these facilities are based on average day flow of 1 5-mgd, maximum day demand of 28- 
mgd and water quality softening requirements. Based on raw water quality data provided by the City of 
Flint, a lime dosage of 209 mg/I, soda ash dosage of 47 mg/I and carbon dioxide dosage of 37 mg/I were 
used to estimate lime sludge quantities and flows.

Additional Chemical Storage 


During the Phase ! improvements, the MDEQ did not mandate 30-day chemical bulk storage 
requirements since the plant was a redundant water supply to the DWSD. However, if the facility 
becomes a continuously operated treatment plant, then additional chemical storage must be added to 
meet the minimum storage volume requirements. To comply with the regulations, new oxygen, nitrogen 
and carbon dioxide storage facilities must be provided as follows,

D. Electrical and SCADA Improvements 

Section 9, relating to power and controls, of the Phase II study was prepared by Dmytryka jacobs 
Engineers (DjE). The scope of the Phase II work did not include detailed investigations of the water plant 
site-wide power distribution nor the secondary power distribution within each of the facility structures. 
However, a number of observations and basic recommendations were presented in Section 9 by DJE. 

The Flint Water Plant currently uses 2400V as primary power throughout the facility. Ali of the power 
feeders in the plant site are 5kV rated and it appears the existing switchgear is also rated at 5kV, Most of 
the major electrical improvements installed during Phase I were dual voltage (2400/4160) equipment in 
anticipation of the plant power being changed to 4160V in the near future. This change would aiiow the 
existing network of power feeders to handle approximately twice the power and would eliminate running 
new feeders to various portions of the plant. 



Page 4 of 12 



The current sub-station has two 2.5MVA transformers running in parallel for a total capacity 5 MVA, 
These old transformers are not equipped with cooling fans. The full connected load to these transformers 
is estimated to he 6,97 MVA while the estimated power load at 36 MCD is 4.22MVA, Based on these 
estimates there is sufficient power for the plant with both sub-station transformers in service. Even 
though the transformers are owned by Consumers Energy, it could take weeks to replace one of these 
main transformers in the event of a unit failure, which will result in reduced treatment and pumping 
capacity. The sub-station switchgear was installed in I960 and is antiquated and difficult to maintain. 

The two existing Fairbanks Morse generators are currently inoperable and would cost approximately $1M 
to rehabilitate. The DJE team recommended installing two new emergency generators in lieu of re- 
building the existing units. 

Section 9 of the Phase II report provides sufficient detail for the purposes of this report, but a detailed 
electric system evaluation of the entire plant should be performed prior to any major improvements to 
this facility. 

While LAN did not perform a detailed review of the WTP electrical system during our site visit, it appears 
that all of the DJE findings are still pertinent. We, therefore, concur with the improvements as 
recommended by DJE in tbc Phase I report.

E. Post-Chlorination and Zebra Mussel Control 

The previous report recommended changing the disinfection system from gaseous chlorine to sodium 
hypochlorite due to the potential for hazardous gas release and the requirements imposed by new federal 
regulations. Previous treatability studies have not addressed the potential impact of re-growth in the 
system due to ozonation by-products. These impacts should be addressed prior to proceeding with final 
plans for using river water. 

The Flint River is known to be infested with Zebra mussels and mitigation measures wifi have to be 
implemented if the plant is placed into continuous operation. A sodium permanganate feed system is 
proposed to address these concerns.

G. PS No. 4 - Low and High Service Pumps 

Section 7 of the Phase I! report included recommendations to replace two of the low lift pumps and two 
of the high lift pumps along with various other improvements. During the site visit, it was apparent the 
condition of this facility has continued to deteriorate. Furthermore, with the reduction in water system 
demands, the various pump capacities are no longer properly sized to efficiently meet the new plant flow 
ranges. The pumps and motors are oversized and are operating outside their best efficiency ranges and 
should be replaced due to age, condition and cost to operate. 

Additionally, some of these pumps cannot be operated due to excessive vibrations in the shaft and steady 
bearings. Existing vibration monitors are functioning as designed and are shutting the power off to the 
motors to avoid damage. 

For low lift service, it is proposed to install two 10-mgd and two 15-rngd (nominal ratings) vertically 
mounted pumps equipped with low voltage inverter duty motors. The motors would be powered by low 


Page 6 of 12 



voltage variable frequency drives. This will provide a firm rated capacity of approximately 35-mgd in 
low lift capacity. 

For high lift service, it is proposed to install one 10-mgd, two 15-mgd and one 20-mgd (nominal ratings) 
pumps equipped with medium voltage inverter duty motors. These motors will be power by medium 
voltage variable frequency drives. This combination of pumps will provide a firm rated capacity of 40- 
mgd.

microbial contaminants, additional treatment technologies and enhancement of existing processes must 
be implemented to comply with these regulations. 


As required under the enhanced surface water treatment rules, it is essential for water utilities to address 
giardia, Cryptosporidium, viruses and bacteria in finished water. The level of treatment is dependent on 

Page 7 of 12 




the source water classification. The City of Flint will need to perform a two-year source water study to 
determine the bin placement for the Flint River, For the purposes of this report, a Bin 4 placement was 
selected due to the nature of the watershed and, therefore, it is assumed enhanced Ct and UV 
inactivation will be required. 

Reservoir No. 3 does not provide sufficient Ct to meet the current regulations, therefore, Dort Reservoir 
will need to be placed into the process train. Since Dort Reservoir docs not match the hydraulic profile 
of the plant, an intermediate pump station will be required. This new facility wiil also include a UV 
inactivation system to comply with the enhanced water quality regulations. 

This proposed facility, located west of the filters and south of Dort Reservoir, will house three 14-mgd 
(nominal rating} variable speed pumps with inverter duty, low voitage motors for a firm rated capacity of 
28-mgd. Housed in a separate part of this same structure will be the UV system that will be equipped 
with three 1 2" medium pressure units with a rated capacity of 28-mgd.

I. Emergency Interconnect Pumping Station 

The City of Flint and Genesee County DWWS have entered into an agreement to provide 8-mgd of back- 
up service to each other under emergency conditions. There are several alternatives for pumping station 
locations and configurations to accomplish this interconnect. For the purposes of this report, a station 
located west of the filter building was selected as the most practical from and operational cost 
perspective. While the opinions of cost presented below indicate that these pumps wilt be housed in 
their own structure, it is feasible to house the pumps in the filler transfer station for potential savings. 

Preliminary design for this pumping station include two constant speed 8-mgd pumps equipped with soft 
starts and medium voltage motors. A reverse flow control station wiil be included within the same 
structure to allow for flow from the DWWS to assist the City of Flint, Approximately three miles of 24- 
inch pipeline will be needed to connect the two systems.

III. Cost of Additional Operation 

The City of Flint currently operates the water treatment plant periodically during the year to maintain the 
systems and to meet regulatory requirements. The water treatment plant is staffed with various 
classifications of employees to operate and maintain the facility for these minimal operations. 

As pari of this work, and to develop all costs of providing water service from the Flint River, it is 
necessary to determine the probable cost for operating and maintaining this facility for continuous 
operation. Water quality differences between the Flint River and Lake Huron are significant and require 
different treatment chemicals and dosages. Most noticeable is the fact that Lake Huron water does not 
require softening which negates the need for softening process and the associated lime sludge disposal. 

The primary cost parameters that are included in this difference are labor, chemicals, residual disposal 
and electrical power. Each will be discussed in the following seciions. These costs were projected 
through the year 2050.

Labor 


Additional staffing was discussed and developed with representatives from the City of Flint to provide full 
time coverage on a 24/7/365 schedule, plus provide staff for residua! management and operations of the 
various dams. Hourly rates and fringe benefits were based on current budget figures and inflated at a 
rate of 3% for future costs. The following table outlines the proposed staffing a cost for this operational 
element.

This estimate represents approximately $2,034,000 per year of additional labor. 
B. Chemicals 


Chemical costs are based on the projected average day water demand of 14-mgd and the average dose 
for each of the chemicals based on the raw water quality information and other operational records. 
Further, data from the previous treatability work performed during the Phase I improvements was also 
incorporated into these estimates. Chemical suppliers and other water utilities were contacted to obtain 
current chemical purchase costs which were adjusted by the ENR ratio back to an index of 3688. Where 
necessary, transportation costs to the Fiint, Mi area were included. The following summarizes the 
chemical costs associated with treating the Flint River water.

In addition to the above, the cost of ozone will need to be added which is approximately $20.08 per 
million gallons per day per mg/1 dose. This cost includes oxygen, nitrogen and power costs. 

C. Residual Disposal 

This category is divided into two groups: clarifier sludge collected in the plate settling basins and lime 
sludge from the softening process. The clarifier sludge is pumped from the clarifier basins by zone (six 
zones per train, three trains, total of 1 8 zones) to the plant main drain. As part of the Phase I work, the 
main drain was connected to a new wastewater pumping station located south of the filter gailery 
building. This pump station discharges the collected residuals to the city's sanitary sewer system. Nearly 
all of the filter wash water is recirculated back to the head of the ozone facility for re-use. 

The cost to treat clarified sludge discharged into the sanitary sewer system is calculated as follows: 


Page 10 of 12

Primary Sludge (#/d 1 3,435 

% Solids 2% 

Sludge (gal s/d ay) 80,500 

Sludge (cf/day) 10,762 


Based on the City of Flint's current wastewater charges of $1 .00 per 100 cf, the annual cost would be 
$39,200 per year. 

Lime/Soda Ash softening generates large quantities of residual wastes that have high disposal costs. The 
treatment proposed in this study involves pumping the sludge, at about 4% concentration, from the 
softening basins to two gravity thickeners, where it will concentrate to about 12% solids. After 
thickening, sludge will be pumped to the fitter presses to be dewatered to approximately 55% solids. 
The filter presses will drop the cake into a lower bunker where it will be removed by an end loader to 
the main storage bunker. About every three months, the sludge will be loaded onto trucks and applied 
to agricultural land. 

The volume of sludge is estimated as follows:

Based on the preceding, 471 tons of softening sludge at 55% solids will be handled each week based on 
average flow and chemical dosage, Several Michigan water facilities were contacted to obtain lime 
sludge hauling and disposal costs. From this data a rate of $1 8.50 per wet ton was selected as a 
reasonable rate for disposal cost. This rate will result in an annua! cost of $453,000. 

I>, Power 

Practically all of the additional power costs are associated with low lift, intermediate transfer and high 
service pumping. Additional power costs will be used for process and handling of the softening sludge. 
The City of Flint is currently paying $0.07 per kwhr for service at the water plant. Power costs are 
calculated as follows: 


TDH (ft) - High 190

Solids Handling per MGD $4,98 

Total Power Cost per MGD $104.49 


Annual costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the Flint Water Plant are summarized in 
the attached tables following this section. 

IV. Project Implementation Schedule 

There are a number of issues that will impact the implementation schedule for this work. The source 
water studies to define bin number associated with Cryptosporidium and giardia will take approximately 
two years. Part of these studies can be performed concurrently with design, but sufficient work will need 
to be performed to avoid impacting design schedule or work. A planning period of one year should be 
allowed for preliminary water quality and regulatory evaluations prior to initiating design work. Design 
of this project will require 10 to 12 months, with an additional three months required for permitting. 

After permits are received, allow three months for bidding and contract execution. Major equipment 
procurement and construction will take from 24 to 30 months. Plant commissioning will take about 2 
months, 

Total time required from notice to proceed to project completion 52 months to 60 months. This time 
frame does not include financing issues.

Proposed Scope of Upgrades to Flint WTP 


1. Introduction 

The City of Flint plans to utilize their existing WTP to provide water on a continuous basis. The city plans 
to treat water from the Flint River until construction of the proposed KWA supply is complete and the 
WTP can then be used to treat water from Lake Huron. An evaluation of the WTP to provide treatment 
of water from both sources is in process to define the scope of upgrades needed to provide reliable 
service. In addition to the different treatment requirements of each source, the WTP has not been 
operated on a continuous basis for 40+ years so facilities are also being evaluated to identify equipment 
which should be replaced because of its age, condition, or obsolescence. 

2. Preliminary Scope of Work 

Based on, the WTP evaluation, the following scope of proposed upgrades has been developed. This 
summary is preliminary, provided for review and comment by interested parties, Comments received 
will be used to finalize the scope of work to be implemented at the Flint WTP. 

The proposed upgrades have been categorized into two phases. Phase 1 is work that will be completed 
as soon as practical so that the WTP can be utilized to treat water from the river in 2014. Phase 2 work 
is needed to provide long-term service with the proposed KWA Lake Huron water source. Phase 2 work 
will be completed in 2015 to 2016. 

Work is proposed to be contracted except where noted "by city" the work is planned to be completed 
by City staff. 

Item 1 - Chemical Systems ! Ozone 


Additional storage of nitrogen and oxygen will be provided for redundancy and 30 day capacity. 
Existing ozone units will be serviced to prepare for continuous operation. 


New alternative coagulant chemical feed system will be added for treatment of raw water from Lake 
Huron. —

Item 5 - Low and High Service Pump Station No. 4 

As a result of decreased demands, pumps at Pump Station No. 4 are "over-sized" and do not efficiently 
operate. Some of the pumps experience vibrations in the shafts and steady bearings. The existing pump 
station will be rehabilitated to replace "over-sized" pumps and obsolete equipment and provide needed 
maintenance. Proposed work includes: 





• 25 mgd Low Service Pump No. 4 - upgrade motor to inverter duty, rehabilitate pump and piping, 
install new valve, a ndJnstall new VFD 

15 mdg Low Service Pump No. 6- rehabilitate pump shaft and bearings 

• Install two new High Service Pumps (15 mgd @190 feet TH, vertically mounted pumps with 800

Item 8 - Raw Water Piping Connection 


The proposed KWA raw water pipeline will connect to the existing 72" PCCP finished water supply line 
near Center and Pierson Roads. (East of this connection, the 72" PCCP will be utilized by GCDC-WWS for 
distribution of finished water in the GCDC-WWS service area.) Raw water from Lake Huron will be 
conveyed to the WTP site via the 72" PCCP pipeline. On the WTP site, the 72" pipeline will be tapped for 
a 42" pipe and for a 36" pipe to convey raw water for treatment. The following work is proposed: 

• Piping connections 

• 900 feet of 42" water main 

• 100 feet of 36" water main 

• Roadway and site restoration 

• Storm sewer relocation 

• Control valve rehabilitation and replacement

3. Other Items to Address to Finalize Scope of Work 

In addition to the upgrades proposed above, the following issues/questions need to be addressed 
before finalizing the scope of proposed upgrades to the WTP: 

a) Options for handling / disposal of lime sludge from softening operations (during period Flint 
River is water source) 

b) Requirements for CT and enhanced treatment 

c) Impacts of using river as continuous supply (quantity, quality monitoring & control, reservoir 
operating levels) 

d) Chemical storage options

Bill and Liane, 

Please have the attached documents reviewed and comments provided relative to the City of Flint water supply needs 
and relative to the impacts that are possible to the Detroit System. 

Treasury needs an assessment as to the need for the alternative water supply and it's impacts so they can provide input 
to the financial managers. 

We need comments by next week and will likely meet with the Director on Thursday. 

Bring in whatever staff you need for the review and ple3ase try to have your assessments by Wednesday morning. 

Sorry for the tight time frame but this one is out of my hands. I will also be looking at the report.

STATE OF MICHIGAN CONTRACT NO. 271N3200089 


CITY OF FLINT WATER SUPPLY ASSESSMENT 


At the request of the Treasurer, Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. (TYJT) makes the following recommendation to the 
Department of Treasury concerning Flint's water supply alternatives. Based on the financial analysis performed of the 
various options presented by DWSD to continue treated water service to Flint compared to Flint being supplied by the 
new KWA untreated water system, TYJT believes that several of the options presented by DWSD are lower in cost 
currently and over the long run than the one offered by KWA. TYJT also believes that DWSD's most recent offer 
(subsequent to the submittal of our report) to build a smaller parallel water main from Imlay to Flint, funded by the 
entire DWSD base of customers, is the best solution offering the least cost alternative and the required redundancy by 
MDEQ. 

Furthermore, since a majority of the KWA system has not been designed and none of the system has been constructed, 
there is an additional risk that the cost of the KWA system may actually be higher than estimated due to potential 
construction delays and unforeseen conditions. This risk to Flint could be substantial since the city is responsible for 30 
percent of the KWA design and construction costs while still having to purchase water from DWSD during the 
construction period. 

Finally, there are other issues that were identified in our report that may result in risks to Flint if it were to join KWA that 
should be considered by the Treasury in determining how Flint's potable water should be supplied. These issues are 
related to redundancy and reliability, other items affecting cost, and Flint's desire to control its own destiny related to its 
water supply. These are described further below. 

• DWSD's supply to Flint is via a 72-inch water main from Imlay City. This main also supplies Imlay City, Mayfield and 
the Greater Lapeer County Utilities Authority (GLCUA). The volume of water contained within the 72-inch main is 
approximately 30 million gallons. If Genesee and Flint move to KWA then the three remaining communities' 
consumption would most likely not be large enough to maintain fresh water in DWSD's pipeline (due to loss of 
chlorine residual). DWSD may consider shutting down the 72-inch line completely due to the water quality 
concerns, which would then create an additional burden for Imlay, Mayfield and GLCUA to finance treated water 
supplies. 

• The KWA supply option is counter to the Treasury's Competitive Grant Assistance Program (Formerly EVIP Grant). 
This program has been put in place to allow for communities to consolidate their services and save money. Two 
existing customers of DWSD (Flint and Genesee County) along with the potential of others customers (GLCUA, 
Mayfield, Imlay City) separating from another water system is in contradiction to the program. 

• There is a concern over the ability of smaller systems (KWA) over larger systems (DWSD) to pay for future unfunded 
mandates and regulations. Obviously, identifying regulation requirements over 30 years is hard to determine. 
However, it is widely accepted that a large system has greater ability to respond to unfunded mandates because the 
cost can be distributed over a large customer base, 

• Although Flint will be responsible for 30 percent of the construction cost, they will only have a minority vote on the 
KWA board. Furthermore, there are other communities (Lapeer County, the City of Lapeer, and Sanilac County) that 
sit on the board and vote. However, they are not purchasing water nor contributing to the construction costs. Their 
position on the KWA Board will not provide them an ability to "control their own destiny," as they have stated to the 
Treasury.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Tucker, Young, Jackson, Tull, Inc. (TYJT), at the request of the State Treasurer performed an analysis of 
the water supply options being considered by the City of Flint. The City of Flint is presently supplied 
potable water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). This supply is from a single 
72-inch water main that terminates at a master meter located at Potter and Baxter. Additionally, 
downstream of the DWSD master meter, Flint supplies its customer Genesee County. The City of Flint 
also operates a water treatment plant that uses the Flint River as its source of supply to provide back up 
and redundancy to the DWSD supply as required by MDEQ 

The Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is planning on constructing a raw water supply system that 
could provide Lake Huron water to the Flint Water Treatment Plant. Flint's existing plant would be 
upgraded to treat the new raw water source. 

The State Treasurer has appointed an emergency financial manager for the City of Flint. As such the 
Treasurer has requested TYJT to provide an analysis of the water supply options to assist the Treasurer 
in determining any potential risk and the best course going forward for supplying potable water to the 
City of Flint. 


Report Organization 

The following sections of this report are described below: 

Section 2 - The basis of the analysis is described in this section. The options include the KWA option and 
several options offered by DWSD. 

Section 3 - A significant amount of information and data was collected including memorandums, 
reports, drawings, financial reports, and other documents. This section summarizes the information 
used in the analysis. 

Section 4 - This section describes the evaluation of the cost of supply for the Flint options. The costs are 
comprised of the initial cost of operations plus the annual rate of escalation/inflation. 

Section 5 - The evaluation process used to analyze the construction costs associated with the KWA 
supply system is described in this section. Additionally, the cost of financing the capital requirements is 
described. 

Section 6 - This section presents the financial review of the options considered to supply potable water 
to Flint. A summary of these options is also provided. 

Section 7 - In addition to the financial analysis other considerations were identified that should be 
considered in understanding the risks and determining the best option to supply Flint. They include 
items related to cost, redundancy and reliability, and Flint's ability to control their future cost of water 
supply.

2. FLINT WATER SUPPLY OPTIONS 

Two water purveyor options were evaluated; the KWA water supply system and continued supply from 
OWSD. Both suppliers would provide water from Lake Huron as the source. The KWA system is a raw 
water supply, which means that the water would have to be treated by Flint before distributing the 
potable water to its customers. The DWSD supply is potable or "finished" water and would not need 
additional treatment. 

Additionally, an option for the Flint WTP to supply the City of Flint without being supplied from either 
DWSD or KWA was initially considered. The preliminary investigation evaluated the cost associated with 
the required improvements to the plant and to the Flint River dam system. Although it appeared that 
this was a viable option, Flint in a meeting on December 20, 2012 with the Treasury, stated that the City 
did not want to pursue the option and it is no longer being considered. 


Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA ) Lake Huron Water Supply 

The KWA water supply system schematic is shown in Figure 2-1. The system is comprised of an intake in 
Lake Huron that supplies water to the Lake Huron Pump Station (LHPS). The LHPS lifts the water and 
pumps it through an approximately 22 mile long 60-inch pipeline. The pipeline terminates at a 5 MG 
reservoir and is then pumped from the Intermediate Pump Station (IPS) through approximately 26 miles 
of 60-inch and 18 miles of 30-inch pipeline to the existing Flint WTP. Downstream of the IPS, 
approximately halfway to the Flint WTP, the 60-inch line would also supply a new Genesee County WTP. 

The raw water transmission system has a 60 MGD capacity and is sized to deliver a maximum of 18 MGD 
to the Flint WTP with an average day supply of 12 MGD. Improvements at the Flint WTP would also be 
required to treat the lake water as the plant is currently designed to treat the Flint River water. 

The term of the KWA contract for Flint is 40 years,

DWSD Water System 

The DWSD system schematic is shown in Figure 2-2. Flint is currently supplied by DWSD at Master 
Meter FL-1, located at Potter and Baxter. Flint typically gets its water from the Lake Huron WTP, located 
in Fort Gratiot, Michigan; near the Lake Huron shoreline. Water is treated and pumped at the Lake 
Huron WTP and supplied through a 120-inch pipeline to an intermediate pump station called the Imlay 
Pump Station, The Imlay Pump Station has 20 MG of reservoir capacity. Depending on the time of year 
and the DWSD system demand, water is either bypassed directly to Flint or it is re-pumped at Imlay. It 
should be noted that the DWSD supply to Flint is part of a very large water system and during 
emergencies or outages water can be supplied from the south up to Flint in lieu of the Lake Huron 
facility.

Figure 2-2: DWSD Water System 


The pipeline from Imlay to FL-1 is a 72-inch pipeline. It has been estimated that the 72-inch line serving 
Flint has a capacity in excess of 90 MGD. 

DWSD has presented several contractual options to Flint and all of them are based on Flint signing a new 
30 year contract. The options shown in Table 2-1 are based on two different supply points; one at the 
current master meter location FL-1 at Potter and Baxter (P&B) and the other at the location of the Imlay 
Pump Station. The reason for the varying options is to provide a lower water rate at the Imlay Station, 
since the DWSD rate formula is based on distance and elevation factors related to the supply location. 

The rates are also dependent on the maximum amount of water DWSD supplies. As example, if DWSD 
supplies a maximum day demand of 18 MGD that would equal the entire amount of water required by 
Flint. 

For the options less than the maximum of 18 MGD means that the Flint WTP would supplement the 
difference by supplying water treated from the Flint River. These options are known as "blending" and 
would allow for Flint to blend two sources of water to supply its customers; the Flint River using the Flint 
WTP and Lake Huron from DWSD system.

4. COST OF SER VICE 

Information provided by DWSD, Flint, and representatives of the KWAwere used in the cost of service 
evaluation. To evaluate the annual escalation/inflation rate over the planning period, the rate 
adjustment for OWSD was estimated based on the recent rate adjustment history. For the KWA system 
both the estimated cost of operations when the system begins supplying water and the annual rate 
adjustment or inflation was evaluated. The existing cost of operations and escalation for the Flint WTP 
was based on actual costs provided and then adjusted depending on the scenario considered. This 
section describes the evaluation process and the rates used in the analysis. 


DWSD Water Supply 

The City of Flint has been a customer of DWSD since 1967. The Flint WTP has been maintained as a 
backup to the DWSD system. As indicated previously, several options were provided by DWSD 
depending on the type of service Flint was to select. The unit cost of water for each of these options is 
shown in Table 4-1. These rates are based on DWSD's FY13, which are current until July 2013.

Table 4-1: Cost of DWSD Supply Options 


To determine annual escalation rate, DWSD's last 10 years of history was used along with other large 
urban water systems in Michigan, The water systems used for benchmarking comparison were: Lansing, 
Grand Rapids, and Saginaw. 

Table 4-2 identifies the annual and average rate of increase to Flint based on supplying water either to 
the current FL-1 at Potter and Baxter or Imlay. Note the last three years of the rates (FY 2011 through 
FY 2013) assumes that Flint's cost would be based on the new 30 year contract; FY 2011 being the first 
year that the new contract was available.

Table 4-3: O&M Inflation Rates of Other Large Water Systems 


Based on the information analyzed from DWSD and the other communities, it was determined that a fair 
annual rate of inflation for operations and maintenance cost for the analysis should be 4.4%. The 4.4% 
has historical significance from Flint's current water supplier and falls within the range of the other 
communities. 


KWA Water Supply 

The initial projected O&M cost for the KWA supply would be comprised of KWA's O&M costs as well as 
Flint's O&M costs. Because there was limited information provided, the initial estimated rate of 
$1.50/MCF was used. This rate is based on information from the cost comparison analysis attached to 
the letter to Mr. Kurtz, dated October 31, 2012. 

The KWA cost evaluation used an annual O&M inflation rate of 5 %. To validate this rate a similar 
analysis to DWSO's operations and maintenance annual rate of inflation was used. First, in discussions 
with Flint and the Genesee County Drain Commission {GCDC), they believed that the annual rate of 
inflation for the new KWA system would be similar to the GCDC Water & Waste Services (WWS). 
Additionally, two large transmission systems were used to benchmark the inflation rates: the 
Southeastern Oakland County Water Authority (SOCWA) and the Ypsilanti Utility Community Authority 
(YUCA). Although both of these systems transmit finished water opposed to raw water, they were 
considered similar enough for comparison as they are comprised of only large water mains, pumping 
facilities and storage. 

Once again audited financial statements were used to calculate the inflation rates. A summary of the 
findings are shown in Table 4-4. Based on the fact that the information analyzed showed a large 
difference between the two systems, it was determined that the KWA assumption of 5% was a good rate 
of inflation to use in the financial analysis. This rate is almost equally between the GCDC rate and the 
other two transmission systems.

Flint WTP 

The Flint WTP currently serves as a backup supply to the DWSD service to Flint. To maintain backup 
operations, the City of Flint operates the plant approximately 20 days each year. Flint indicated that the 
average production rate when they operate is 11 MGD. 


For the blending options and the KWA supply considered, Flint would be required to operate its plant all 
year around. Therefore, their operating and maintenance costs were evaluated and adjusted to 
determine an annual cost associated with year-round operations. 


The Flint WTP provided three years of operating costs for the assessment. Additionally, reports listed in 
Section 3 were also used as reference to determine both operating costs for the plant processing Flint 
River water (blending options) and Lake Huron raw water (KWA option). 


Major cost centers were analyzed to estimate annual operation and maintenance. They included: labor, 
utilities, chemicals and residual management. In general, as recommended by the Flint plant staff, labor 
and overhead were increased from the current costs by two-thirds. Additionally, variable costs for 
power, chemicals and residual cost were increased to estimate full time treatment at the Flint WTP. 

Data from the KWA Preliminary Report and annual operating data for the Flint WTP (provided 
separately) were analyzed to make these forecasts. 

The annual operating and maintenance costs developed for Flint WTP used are shown in Table 4-5.

$5,895,097 


Lake Huron (Supplied by KWA) 12 $7,913,118 

Table 4-5: FY 13 O&M Costs for Year-round Operations 


It was determined that a fair annual rate of inflation for operations and maintenance cost for the Flint 
WTP plant should be 4.51%. The 4.51% is an average of Lansing, Grand Rapids and Saginaw facilities.

5. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

Large capital investments would be required by Flint and GCDCto construct the KWA supply system. 
Furthermore, some of the options presented by DWSD (supply point from Imiay) would require the 
purchase by Flint of DWSD's 72-inch water main. Performing the financial analysis; therefore, required 
an analysis of the KWA construction cost estimate for the transmission system and Flint WTP 
improvements. 

Revenue bonds were also identified as the source of financing the new supply system and associated 
improvements. This section describes the assumptions made and the interest used for financing the 
improvements. 


KWA Supply System 

The most current cost estimate of the KWA system was presented in the document titled; Lake Fluron 
Supply Study, KWA, Appendix 20, October 2012 Preliminary Report Update, Final Report (DRAFT), 
October 4, 2012. The cost of construction is estimated at $272,421,558. Flint's portion would be 30% or 
$81,726,467. 

Due to the significance of this expenditure, a detailed review of the cost was performed and is 
presented in this section. The analysis was performed based on the main elements of the supply 
system: the lake intake, the two pumping stations, and the transmission pipeline. Additionally, an 
analysis was performed related to construction contingencies and other costs such as engineering, legal, 
and administration. 


Lake Intake 

KWA representatives indicated in a meeting in November that the design documents for the intake were 
at 90% and that it was planned for advertisement in January 2013. A summary of the estimate is shown 
in Table 5-1. 



Intake and Crib $22,076,850 


ELAC at 25% 5,519,213 

Property 2,300,000 

Total $29,896,063 

Table 5-1: KWA Intake Cost Estimate 

Based on the evaluation, it appeared that the cost estimate was reasonable. Given that the design was 
nearly complete, the engineering, legal, administration, and construction contingencies (ELAC) at 25% 
were also found to be appropriate. 


12 



Pumping Stations 

KWA representatives indicated that the pump stations were estimated at a level of design less than 15%. 
Therefore, in addition to an evaluation of their cost estimate, other water pumping station costs were 
used for comparison. Additionally, contractors were also contacted for costs. Table 5-2 summarizes the 
KWA cost estimate compared to our cost estimate performed for the Treasury.

Table 5-2: Pumping Stations Cost Estimate 

Two things to note regarding the difference in the cost estimates; firstly, there is a large difference in 
the cost estimates of the pumping stations. The estimate developed for the Treasury used several other 
pumping stations construction costs from Southeastern Michigan and discussions with contractors. 
These costs were then computed on a $/MG's for comparison. 

Secondly, our estimate for the Treasury is based on an ELAC of 30% instead of KWA's 25%. Although 
25% was acceptable for the intake, it is believed to be too low for the pumping station estimate given 
that the engineering effort is less than 15%. 


Transmission Main 

Although the specific route for the transmission main was not provided, an estimate was calculated 
based on the general information provided. Once again, the KWA estimate was based on a level of 
design less than 15%. The estimate performed for the Treasury used the line items provided by KWA for 
the pipeline and also consulted with contractors to evaluate the cost of construction. The comparison is 
shown in Table 5-3. 

Although the cost of construction of the pipeline is similar, a value of 30% was used for ELAC due to the 
level of design. Additionally, KWA did not believe there would be any additional costs for easements; 
however, this did not seem practical. Therefore an estimate for acquiring the easements was added to 
the Treasury estimate and is based on the 277 easements identified by KWA. The cost shown includes 
surveying, legal, engineering, administration, etc.

Other KWA Costs 

In prior estimates of the construction cost, KWA used an ELAC of 37%. In this case it could be 
considered that the engineering effort associated with the design would have been included. However, 
It is believed that KWA's reduced ELAC of 25%, does not include the design effort. Additionally, it would 
be prudent to assume that the owner would want a construction manager during construction of this 
large project. A summary of these costs are shown in Table 5-4.

Table 5-4: Other Costs 


Summary Comparison 

A summary of the two cost estimates are shown in Table 5-5. Based on the comparison, the estimate 
performed by TYJT shows a higher cost to Flint by approximately $25,000,000. 

Note that there are two other costs shown in the summary that were not previously addressed; power 
and backup power. Regarding the cost of providing power to the pumping facilities, the cost of 
$4,000,000 appears reasonable. 


14 



The KWA has repeatedly indicated that backup power is not needed. Backup power is a standard 
practice in the water industry. Furthermore, a loss of power at either pumping facility will prevent the 
supply of water to both Flint and Genesee County. For these reasons, the cost of providing backup 
power was included in our estimate for the Treasury.

Flint WTP Improvements 

The KWA analysis identified capital costs required to convert the existing WTP from river water 
treatment to treating lake water. The cost estimate was identified as $7,100,000 in the 2009 report. 
This number was used in the our analysis, since additional information was not provided. For the 
purpose of the financial analysis; however, the $7,100,000 was increased by 3% each year for three 
years to account for inflation. 


DWSD Imlay Station Supply Options 

The options identified by DWSD to supply service to Flint at the Imlay Pump Station would require Flint 
to purchase the 72-inch water main from Imlay to Master Meter, FL-1. The pipeline is approximately 25 
miles long, The estimated cost provided by DWSD for estimating purposes is $4,700,000. 


Financing 

The cost of financing the revenue bonds for the capital work was investigated. Based on conversations 
with local financial advisors knowledgeable in bond financing, an interest rate of 5% for the 25 year 


15 


period was considered acceptable. This is based on a Standard and Poor's bond rating of A without 
insurance. 

Additional costs associated with the bond include the reserve and bond issuance fee. The bond holders 
will require a reserve of approximately 10% of the loan to be held for the 25 year payment period. The 
cost associated with the bond issuance has been estimated at 2.25% of the principal borrowed for the 
KWA project and 3% for the smaller loan associated with the Flint WTP improvements or the purchase 
of the 72-inch main. 

Furthermore, since no revenue will be generated to pay on the bonds for the first three years that the 
system is being constructed, the cost associated with capitalizing the interest was also included. 

Finally, interest on the reserve will be provided back to KWA and Flint. Although the interest is currently 
less than 1%, it was determined that a 3% rate would be more prudent long-term.

6. FINDINGS 

Using the information described in the previous sections, a cost evaluation was conducted for the KWA 
supply and the DWSD options. Individual worksheets for each option are provided in Appendix B. For 
the purpose of comparison a 30 year period was used. This period includes the 3 year construction 
period, the 25 loan period and an additional two years to get a sense of the cost of operation after the 
loans have been paid. 

There were three separate cost sheets prepared for the KWA option. The first cost sheet (KWA) is based 
on the cost estimate provided by KWA. The costs provided assumed no overruns or delay in 
construction. With KWA's own assumptions of an overrun in construction of 15% and a one year delay 
in operations, the KWA estimated cost becomes $686,375,920 through Year 2042. 

Since this cost estimate did not appear to include the financing of revenue bonds, another cost sheet 
(KWA-1) was developed that included KWA's cost estimate without overruns with the additional finance 
costs associated with the revenue bonds. A final cost sheet (KWA-2) includes the cost associated with 
the revenue bonds based on the estimate provided by TYJT for the Treasury. 

A summary of the cost sheets provided in Appendix B are shown in Table 6-1. Figure 6-1 shows the 
cumulative annual costs associated with each option.

* $686,375,920 with 15% overrun in construction and a one year delay in operations 

Table 6-1: Total Cost of Options through 2042 


Based on the analysis, it is prudent to assume the KWA water supply option costs would be somewhere 
between the KWA-1 and KWA-2 options. Therefore, the analysis indicates that the two DWSD options 
of supplying 8 MGD on a maximum day and up to 8 MGD on average are the least cost options for Flint. 
These options allow Flint to maximize the use of existing assets; the City of Flint's (the Flint WTP) and 
DWSD's (the existing 72-inch main). 

Additionally, in recent conversations with the Treasury another option was discussed that could 
potentially be the most cost-effective solution. Currently the Flint WTP serves as a backup if service is 


17 


lost through either the DWSD or KWA pipeline. If the a twin pipe paralleling the DWSD 72-inch water 
main were constructed with interconnects with the 72-inch line, then the new water main could serve as 
the backup to Flint and the Flint WTP could be abandoned or potentially sold to Genesee County for 
their use. 

The construction of the parallel pipeline would be considered in the DWSD capital expenditure as a 
Common to All (CTA) cost. This means that the capital cost of the pipeline would be shared by all DWSD 
customers and not just by Fiint. Preliminary analysis of this option appears to be the most cost-effective 
of all the options discussed. However, a more thorough cost analysis is warranted and this approach 
would require an agreement between Flint and DWSD.

7. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 

As part of the investigation other issues were identified that may result in risks to Flint that should be 
considered by the Treasury in determining how Flint's potable water should be supplied. These issues 
are related to redundancy and reliability, other items affecting cost, and Flint's desire to control its own 
destiny related to its water supply. These are described further below. 


Redundancy/Reliability 

In one of the first meetings related to this task assessment, which was held on November 1, 2012, the 
Genesee County Drain Commissioner, Mr. Jeff Wright, stated that one of the main reasons for pursuing 
the KWA supply option related to the tack of reliability of the DWSD system. Fie pointed to the 
Northeast blackout of 2003; a widespread power outage that occurred throughout parts of the 
Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada, on Thursday, August 14, 2003. He 
stated that Flint and Genesee County were out of water for several days. 

It is worth noting that this was a power outage of historic proportions that affected millions of 
Americans. However, DWSD did begin supplying water again relatively quickly in comparison to other 
major cities impacted by the same power outage. 

Furthermore, the KWA supply system offers less redundancy to Flint than the current DWSD system. 
Under both options, Flint is supplied by a single pipeline; however, DWSD has backup power at ail of its 
major facilities supplying Flint. The KWA system will not have a redundant power at its pumping 
facilities. This would be a major risk. 

Currently, backup to the DWSD system for Flint is Flint's WTP using the Flint River as the source of 
supply. KWA has stated that the Flint River source would also be used as backup to Flint if the KWA 
supply through its pipeline was lost. However, since the Flint WTP would be upgraded to treat Lake 
Huron water under the KWA option, using the Flint River as a backup source would require the Fiint 
WTP to maintain two process treatment streams. 

In addition to Flint and Genesee County, the DWSD's 72-inch main supplies Imlay City, Mayfield and the 
Greater Lapeer County Utilities Authority (GLCUA). The volume of water contained within the 72-inch 
main is approximately 30 MG. Only supplying these three remaining communities would cause the 
waterage to increase dramatically; somewhere in excess of three weeks old, before reaching the 
customers' master meters. Since the half-life of chlorine in the DWSD system is approximately 5 days, 
the chlorine would most probably be near zero requiring re-chlorination of the finished water upstream 
of the master meters. 

Re-chlorinating is a costly and risky process due to the instability of chlorine gas. It is unknown whether 
DWSD would pursue this improvement or possibly abandoned the 72-inch pipeline. 

If Flint is supplied by the KWA system, then DWSD supplying their other customers along the 72-inch 
water main may be reconsidered. Since the KWA system is a raw water supply, the communities would 


19 



either have to build a treatment facility to treat the water from KWA or find another water source for 
their communities. 


Additional Cost and Risk Considerations 

The design of the KWA supply and the construction of the system have not been completed; therefore, 
final costs and time to complete are unknown. Cost overruns and delays in completion will both 
negatively impact Flint's final cost. As example, if the project is not completed within the three year 
period, payment on the bonds will be due, but the revenue source needed from the sale of water could 
not be provided. 

Furthermore, there is always a risk with large water system construction; especially those including an 
intake in the Great Lakes, pumping stations and rehabilitation of older water treatment plants. These 
risks include the potential of explosive gases in tunneling below Lake Huron, changing site conditions 
associated with the large number of miles of pipe installation and rehabilitating an older WTP, and the 
startup and debugging of the entire pumping system. 

Flint has indicated that they have a high water loss. Not addressing this issue prior to sizing the Flint 
supply pipeline from KWA could cause the water main to be oversized along with its incremental cost in 
construction. 

Also, the KWA supply option appears to run counter to the Treasury's Competitive Grant Assistance 
Program (Formerly EVIP Grant). This program has been put in place to allow for communities to 
consolidate their services and save money. Two existing customers of DWSD (Flint and Genesee County) 
along with the potential of others customers (GLCUA, Mayfield, Imlay City) separating to from another 
water system is in contradiction to the program. 

Finally, there is a concern over the ability of smaller systems (KWA) over larger systems (DWSD) to pay 
for future unfunded mandates and regulations. Obviously, identifying regulation requirements over 30 
years is hard to determine. However, it is widely accepted that a large system has greater ability to 
respond to unfunded mandates because the cost can be distributed over a large customer base. 


Flint's Autonomy 

Flint has indicated that a major point of consideration is that they have no control over the rate 
increases issued to Flint by DWSD. All other counties supplied by DWSD have representatives on the 
Board of Water Commissioners (BOWC). The BOWC is one of the governing bodies that approve the 
water rates. Since Flint and Genesee County do not have a representative on the BOWC, Flint believes 
they are held "hostage" to DWSD's rates and cost of service. 

This issue was stated in Flint's handout at the November 1, 2012 meeting. The handout is titled, "Flint 
Water Supply Future." However, it is worth noting in the same handout, Flint also identifies similar 
concerns with the governing board of the KWA system. Notably, that although Flint and Genesee 
County will be the only customers and Flint will be responsible for 30 percent of the construction cost, 


20 



they will have a minority vote on the KWA board. Furthermore, there are other communities (Lapeer 
County, the City of Lapeer, and Sanilac County) that sit on the board and vote. However, they are not 
purchasing water nor contributing to the construction costs.

PURPOSE OF Meeting with DWSD for the Indefinite-scope, Indefinite-delivery Contract 

MEETING: Number 00383, 2012 Professional General Architectural/Engineering Services - 

City of Flint Water Supply Assessment 

PREPARED BY; Dave Guastella 


A meeting was held at the DWSD Main Office Building on November 19, 2012 to discuss the water 
supply options being presented by DWSD to the City of Flint. The main items discussed generally 
followed the attached DWSD Discussion/Questions that were provided to the Department prior to 
the meeting. A summary of the key points discussed are provided below. 

DISCUSSION ITEMS 

1. Question/Discussion Item: Verify that the four options presented at the November 1, 2012 
meeting are still available for consideration: 

a. Supplied from Potter & Baxter using the new model contract (assume a Maximum Day 
Customer), 

b. Supplied from Imlay Station, 

c. Finished un-pumped supply from Lake Huron WTP, and 

d. Raw un-pumped supply from Lake Huron WTP, 

DWSD prefers to focus on the first two supply point listed; from the current location at Potter 
& Baxter and at the Imlay Pump Station as these apply specifically to Flint. 

DWSD provided the attached summary regarding the current costs to Flint based on the 
various options that DWSD is offering. The savings associated with each option is provided as 
well. As example , if Flint were to purchase water from the supply point located at Imlay 
Station, the current cost to Flint would be $5,661,000 and it would be a savings of nearly 50%

compared to Flint's current rate. 


2. Question/Discussion Item: What additional capital improvements will be required for each 
option? 

Iflmlay Pump Station is selected as the supply point then Flint would need to purchase the 72- 
inch water main and an agreement to supply Lapeer would need to be worked out. DWSD 
believes that this could be worked out through a "wheeling" charge over the 72-inch main or 
possibly moving the supply point downstream of the Lapeer connection.. DWSD estimates the 
value of the water main at $4.7M. Flint could bond for this amount or DWSD could include the 
cost into Flint's rate. 

3. Question/Discussion Item: Are there other options being presented that should be 
considered (e.g., blending)? 

Only the two options indicated above are currently being considered and both would include 
blending; DWSD providing 2/3 of the supply and the Flint WTP providing the other 1/3. 

4. Question/Discussion Item: To evaluate each option over the 25 year planning period, provide: 

a. Annual water rate for Flint for 2002 through 2012, and the 

b. Projected annual rate adjustment for each option. What are the proposed measures 
to keep the rate adjustments down in the future? 

DWSD provided the attached historical rates from 2002 through 2012 for the existing water 
contract with Flint. The attachment also includes what the rates would have been if Flint had 
signed the new model contract or had taken service from Imlay. These rates were provided 
back to 2010. 

DWSD believes that 5% would be a good estimation to assume for their annual escalation in 
rates over the 25 year planning period. 

5. Question/Discussion Item: Flint stated a 10% increase in the capacity charge. What number 
did DWSD provide Flint? 

It was unclear to DWSD where the 10% increase in capacity charge stated by Flint came from. 
DWSD's information provided shows an average of 6.3%. DWSD offered a meeting with TYJT 
to discuss how the fixed and commodity charges are allocated. 

6. Question/Discussion item: Flint financial comparison is based on the initial Cost of 
$14,413,858, which includes $2,725,538 for Flint WTP operating cost; i.e, DWSD charge is 
$11,688,320. Flow good is this number? 

DWSD indicated that the charge of $11,638,320 is good through 6/30/13. based on their 
existing contract with DWSD. 

7. Question/Discussion item: KWA's initial charge to Flint is based on 12 MGD. Is DWSD charge

based on 12 MGD? 

Yes, 12 MGD from DWSD would be a maximum with Flint supplying 6 MGD for a total of 18 
MGD (2/3 vs. 1/3).

PURPOSE OF Meeting with the City of Flint for the Indefinite-scope, Indefinite-delivery 

MEETING: Contract Number 00383, 2012 Professional General Architectural/Engineering 

Services - City of Flint Water Supply Assessment 

PREPARED BY: Dave Guastella 


A meeting was held at the City of Flint Municipal Center on November 20, 2012 to discuss the water 
supply option being presented by the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) to the City of Flint. The 
main items discussed generally followed the attached KWA Discussion/Questions that were 
provided to City prior to the meeting. A summary of the key points discussed are provided below. 

The questions submitted are repeated in the Discussion Items for easy reference. A summary of the 
action items generated from the meeting follow the Discussion Items. 

DISCUSSION ITEMS 

1. Question/Discussion Item: Is the maximum day demand of 18 MGD for Flint the maximum day 
demand (MDD) throughout the 25 year planning period? If not, what is the 25 year projected 
MDD? 

KWA would supply up to 18 MGD. 18 MGD has been assumed as the maximum day demand and 
12 MGD is assumed as the average day demand throughout the 25 year planning period. 

2. Question/Discussion Item: Copy of the intake contract documents and engineer's estimate. 

The intake contract documents are approximately 90% complete and are not available for 
distribution. However, the updated Appendix 20, dated October 4, 2012 includes the most recent 
cost estimate of the intake based on the current design in process. 


Comments: Meeting minutes were recorded based on the understanding of the author. Piease contact the 
author within three days if you have any different understanding of the meeting. These minutes will be 
considered approved unless comments are provided within three days. 




3. Quostion/Discussion Item: Documentation of the Flint WTP improvements required and cost 
estimate. 

The costs are approximately $7M as presented in the September 2009 Preliminary Engineering 
Report. However ; this estimate has been updated. Some processes have been eliminated. John 
O'Brien will provide the updated costs and the description of the planned improvements to the 
plant. 

4. Question/Discussion Item: Confirm Flint's allocated percentage of the KWA capital improvements 
(30%?). 

Yes, the allocation is based on 18 MGD/60 MGD total capacity. 

5. Question/Discussion Item: Copy of the proposed KWA operating agreement for Flint. 

John O'Brien will provide the operating agreement as well as the Capacity Contract and Articles of 
Incorporation. 

6. Question/Discussion Item: What is the annual operating agreement adjustment projected for the 
25 year planning period? 

This information is provided in Appendix 14, Table 14.2 of the September 2009 Preliminary 
Engineering Report. Operating cost based on Table 1. Used 12 MGD as average day demand 
(ADD). Assumed 5% as the annual increase in operating costs. John O'Brien indicated that these 
operating costs were based on Genesee County's operating costs. John O'Brien will provide the 
last 10 years of audited financial statements for the water fund. 

To assess operating and maintenance costs for the Flint WTP, Duffy will provide multiple years of 
financial statements for the water fund. Duffy did not believe they had 10 years, but they will 
provide what they have. 

Regarding operation and maintenance costs, Flint believes that these costs will increase by 2/3 of 
what they are now. 

7. Question/Discussion item: Need the route of the pipelines and the locations of the facilities 
proposed. Purpose is to identify constraints that impact costs (i.e., utilities, environmental (e.g. 
wetlands), easements, etc.). 

KWA will not release the route due to concerns regarding speculation of land and easements. John 
O'Brien did indicate that the Lake Huron pump station would be at Fisher and M-25. The 
intermediate pump station site is near a location of the Lapeer/Sanilac/St. Clair border; where all 
three meet. 

8. Question/Discussion Item: KWA's initial charge to Flint is based on a 12 MGD average day 
demand. What is the basis of this number? Are there population projections and water use 
figures available that were used to determine the Flint demand for the 25 year planning period? 

Comments: Meeting minutes were recorded based on the understanding of the author. Please contact the 
author within three days if you have any different understanding of the meeting. These minutes will be 
considered approved unless comments are provided within three days. 



This was answered in Question No. 1 above. 


9. Question/Discussion item: Is there a transition plan and cost during construction of the KWA 
system identified? 

Flint is looking for an agreement with DWSDfor back-up supply from the 72-inch main at the 
Genesee border. 

10. Question/Discussion Item: The October 4, 2012 Preliminary Engineering Report Update states: 
"no backup power is planned for the pumps" (LHPS) and "No backup power is planned for 
pumping" (IPS). In case of power loss, how would Flint supply its customers? 

Flint indicated that they have adequate storage to supply the system for 6 to 7 days. Flint has 55 
MG of storage and Genesee County has 65 MG for 2.5 days. 


11. Guestion/Discussion Item: The latest plan shows only a 5 million gallon ground reservoir is 
planned for balancing between LHPS and IPS. How is redundancy maintained? 

In cases of emergency, Flint indicated that the back-up for the KWA system will be the same as it is 
now with DWSD; they will use the Flint River as the source water. Flint currently operates their 
plant four times a year. 

When questioned as to whether the WTP will be able to treat both lake water from the KWA 
system and river water Flint indicated that once the improvements identified in the September 
2009 Preliminary Engineering Report are completed they will be able to accomplish both 
treatment processes. Flint will provide a schematic of the treatment trains at the WTP and a copy 
of the Flint transmission system. 

Genesee County indicated that additional redundancy would also be provided from the new 
Genesee County WTP. 

Regarding hydraulic transients ; Genesee County indicated that a model analysis has not been 
included, but capital costs for mitigating transients have been included. 

12. Question/Discussion Item: Related to the construction cost: 


a. Does it include an additional traffic lane since the construction will occupy half the right of 
way? Not required, all roads are county roads; however, there are a few State road 
crossings. 

b. Does it include costs/fees for permit requirements such as inspection cost by the 
jurisdictional authorities? As a point of reference, the permit fee costs for the Flint 
Transmission System came out to be $5,8 million. Not required; all of the counties have 
waived any fees. 

c. Does the cost of the steel pipe segments include corrosion protection measures such as 


Comments: Meeting minutes were recorded based on the understanding of the author. Please contact the 
author within three days if you have any different understanding of the meeting. These minutes will be 
considered approved unless comments are provided within three days. 



anode stations and related O&M? Yes; however , the KWA has not settled on using steel 
pipe. PCCP pipe may be used. Steel shown in estimate because it is highest in cost and 
therefore the pricing is conservative. 

d. SCADA monitoring stations require power. Is the cost of bring power to the SCADA 
stations included? Again, as a point of reference for the Flint Transmission System we 
estimated $800,000 for power to SCADA and valve operators. Yes, Genesee County did 
emphasize that the SCADA system will be simple and straightforward because a lot of 
controls are not required. 

e. Other items discussed at the meeting included: 

• The 2009 plant improvement cost is still good; however, there will be some 
reduction, such as a sulfuric chloride feed system that was eliminated. Plant 
capacity now is 36MGD, but will be 18 MGD. 

• The KWA Lake Huron Pumping Station (LHPS) is now only high lift pump station. 

• Genesee County will provide the distance of the intake pipe from the crib to the 
LHPS. 

• The intake project is almost ready to bid; waiting for the COE permit. 

• Genesee County is estimating the construction for the pipe lines and pump 
stations will begin July 2013. 

• The route has been flown for survey. 

• Genesee County is estimating construction will be complete and the project will 
be placed in service by Jan 2016. 

• Genesee County to provide a list of assumptions that the $272 million cost 
estimate is based on since the route is now known. 

13. The Flint River is identified as a backup: At what capacity? MDD or emergency supply? 

The Flint River would serve as a back up supply. 

14. Where did the 40 years come from (Flint hostage to Detroit}? DWSD's new contracts are 30 years 
with openers to revise terms of supply (volume and pressure) after the first two years, then three 
years, and then in five year increments thereafter. 

The 40 years was stated in error. The reference was to DWSD's requirement to sign a 30 year 
contract. 

After 40 years Flint will own 30% of the project and can sell their share of ownership if they want. 
Conversely, with DWSD, they continue to pay for the capital projects but have no ownership. Flint 
believes they will know what they will be charged for the next 25 years versus DWSD that can't 
commit to a fixed escalation.

Sara- 

Wanted to update you on a couple of potential stories that you could see over the weekend. 

First Nancy Kaffer of the Freep is writing a column for Sunday to do with Flint and the choice of KWA 
over DWSD. She had FOIA'd a doc from MEDQthat had a 2013 report from Andy Dillion that says that 
KWA is a risky proposition and that DWSD was a better option. I let her know that the report was just a 
starting point in the process and as more information became available a joint decision was made by the 
EM, council and other key city leaders. 



Fet me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks.

Subject: NPR Interview-Road Salt 

Today I was interviewed by Rebecca Thiele of public radio WKAR-Kalamazoo. 

The interview was prompted by the findings of Western Michigan University, Carla Koretsky, regarding 
the impact of road salt on a small deep kettle lake within the City of Kalamazoo. We are funding a CMI 
monitoring grant for Dr. Koretsky to conduct additional assessment of several urban lakes and the 
associated watersheds. I provided the reporter with the 2 attached reports and the link for a another 
report prepared by the USGS ( http://pLibs.usgs.gov/sir/2011/S233/ ). These reports all have sections 
devoted to chlorides and correlate high chloride concentrations in lakes and streams with urban land 
use. 

Questions-roughly & answers- briefly-no particular order 

1. From the 2007 NLA report, Mi lakes have higher conductivities and chloride concentrations than 
lakes nationally and within the upper Midwest ecoregion. Why? Speculated that compared to 
the rest of nation, particularly compared to the southern states, we have more sources including 
road salt. Compared to other states in the upper Midwest ecoregion we have more lakes in 
urbanized watersheds. 

2. Will monitoring be conducted at other Kettle Lakes with urbanized watersheds to document the 
extent of the problem? Acknowledged that elevated chloride levels have been documented in 
urbanized areas of Michigan and concentrations in Woods Lake in Kalamazoo are problematic 
which is why we are funding additional work to document the extent of the problem and 
sources. We will routinely continue to monitor Michigan's resources for chlorides but the site 
specific nature of the problem precludes specific sampling for the issue. We do not have a 
Water Quality Standard for chloride but we have not identified toxicity issues where elevated 
concentrations have been found. 

3. Will construction of roadside retention ditches solve the problem? Explained that best 
management practices for the typical NPS pollutants our agency addresses may not be 
appropriate for salt. I made sure the reporter had a contact in MDOT. 

Air date for the story is unknown.

I. City and State officials have exposed and continue to expose Flint residents to 

dangerous amounts of lead in drinking water 

A. The City, Emergency Manager, and State Treasurer chose the Flint River 
as a primary drinking-water source 

In the fall of 20 1 1 , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency 
in the City of Flint and appointed an emergency manager to take control of the City’s 
operations and finances. 2 Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and the City Council were stripped of 
all authority except as specifically allowed by the Emergency Manager, and the City was 
placed in state receivership. 3 Under Michigan’s Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act, an

Emergency Manager has “broad powers” to “rectify the financial emergency and to assure 
fiscal accountability of the local government.” 4 

While under control of the Emergency Manager, the City faced decisions about the 
future of its drinking-water supply. For fifty years, the City had purchased drinking water 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit), which sources water from 
Lake Ehiron. 5 In response to rising water rates charged by Detroit, in March 2013, the City 
Council voted to join the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA), a newly formed municipal 
water supply system. The KWA was planning to build a pipeline to distribute water directly 
from Lake Huron to mid-Michigan communities, including Genesee County, where Flint is 
located. 6 The City Council’s vote did not become effective until several weeks later, after 
both the Emergency Manager and State Treasurer approved the decision. 7 

The City’s contract with Detroit was set to expire in April 2014, at least eighteen 
months before the KWA pipeline was scheduled to be completed. 8 Faced with a year-and-a- 
half gap in the City’s water supply, the Emergency Manager declined to negotiate a short- 
term contract with Detroit and decided instead to use the Flint River as a primary drinking- 
water source. 9 The City had previously explored — and rejected — the Flint River as a 
primary drinking-water source. This is because the Flint Water Treatment Plant would have 
required fifty million dollars in upgrades to treat the river water and “produce finished water 
in conformance with the current federal and state drinking water regulations.” 10

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule, Flint’s water system 
could not use the Flint River as a water source without first obtaining approval from the 
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The Lead and Copper Rule 
required MDEQ to approve both the City’s proposed addition of a new water source (the 
Flint River) and the long-term change in water treatment (from treatment through Detroit’s 
water plant to treatment at the Flint Water Treatment Plant). 11 In April 2014, MDEQ 
approved the switch to river water. 12 The City immediately began pumping Flint River 
water through the City’s distribution pipes and into residents’ taps. 

B. Dangerous lead contamination results from the City's switch to river water 

In the twenty months following the switch in water sources, residents’ drinking water 
has been at times cloudy, discolored, and foul-smelling. 13 Residents reported that they have 
experienced hair loss, skin rashes, and vomiting after drinking the water. 14 In the summer of 
2014, the City was forced to issue several boil-water notices after tap water tested positive 
for total coliform bacteria. 15 The City’s subsequent treatment of the water to kill disease- 
carrying pathogens resulted in elevated levels of total trihalo methanes, a disinfection

Because Flint River water is also highly corrosive, dangerous amounts of lead began 
to leach out of pipes and into the City’s drinking water. 17 Lead in drinking water occurs 
primarily from corrosion of pipes and other plumbing materials that contain lead or lead 
solder. 18 The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to manage lead levels by 
controlling corrosion, which is often accomplished by adding corrosion-inhibiting 
chemicals. 19 Water systems must implement and maintain an “optimal” corrosion-control 
treatment program that “minimizes the lead . . . concentrations at users’ taps.” 20 

Flint did not consider how to control the corrosivity of the river water before 
switching water sources, nor did MDEQ require the City to implement any corrosion- 
control measures. Rather, beginning in April 2014, the City did not use any form of 
treatment to control corrosion. 21 The City waited until after its residents were drinking the 
river water to assess whether it posed a risk of increased lead exposure. MDEQ endorsed 
this approach. In June 2014, Flint’s water system initiated the first of two six-month 
monitoring periods to test tap water for lead under the Lead and Copper Rule; the second 
six-month period ran from January to June 2015. 22 During these monitoring periods, the 
water system used flawed testing methods that appear to have been designed to underreport 
the lead content of residents’ drinking water. 23

Flint’s monitoring data showed that some residents’ water contained lead at 
concentrations above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion (ppb). 24 These high 
lead levels put residents at risk of abroad array of serious, irreversible health effects, 
including cognitive impairment, kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. 25 When the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) learned of these high lead sampling results in 
February 2015, it notified MDEQ officials that the sampling results raised significant 
concerns about corrosion from lead pipes in Flint’s distribution system. 26 Nonetheless, 
throughout the monitoring periods, the City and MDEQ maintained that these high lead 
levels were isolated and that the data, taken together, demonstrated Flint’s compliance with 
the Lead and Copper Rule. 27 

C. Community advocacy and independent testing prompt long past due 
response from City and State officials 

As the City concluded its second six-month round of sampling in July 2015, and 
notified some Flint residents of elevated lead levels in their tap water, the community 
became increasingly concerned. A small coalition of local groups, including Water You 
Fighting For and Concerned Pastors for Social Action, began working with researchers at 
Virginia Tech to conduct their own lead sampling of Flint’s water. The Virginia Tech 
scientists found that ten percent of the more than 250 samples collected from Flint 
residences had lead levels of 25 ppb or more, well above the federal action level for lead. 28 
Several samples exceeded 100 ppb, and one sample exceeded 1000 ppb. 29 Though aware of

the Virginia Tech sampling results, MDEQ officials continued to insist that Flint’s water 
was safe to drink. 30 

In September 2015, a medical study conducted by a local pediatrician confirmed the 
kinds of adverse health impacts that residents had voiced concern about for months: the rate 
of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels had nearly doubled since the City changed 
its drinking-water source. 31 State officials and the Governor reacted by “ downplay [ing] and 
in some cases attempt[ing] to discredit” the pediatrician’s findings, and dismissing citizen 
concerns as “near-hysteri[cal].” 32 

Subsequent testing by MDEQ revealed that at least four schools in Flint had lead 
levels in their drinking water above the federal action level. 33 At Freeman Elementary 
School, water tested had lead levels over 100 ppb, more than six times the federal action 
level. 34 This increase in lead exposure is particularly dangerous in Flint, a community where 
residents are already at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels and lead poisoning. 
Michigan ranks fifth worst in the country for harmful exposures to lead. 35 Tow income is a 
risk factor for lead poisoning, and more than a third of families in Flint live below the 
poverty level, three times the national average. 36 Children in Flint also face high risk of lead

exposure from lead-paint dust, as nearly ninety percent of Flint’s housing stock was built 
before 1978 (when the federal ban on high-lead paint went into effect). 37 

Finally, in late September 2015, the City abandoned its assertions that Flint’s 
drinking water was safe. Nearly seven months after the City first saw dangerously high 
levels of lead in some residents’ water, Flint issued a drinking-water advisory and called for 
state financial assistance to switch the water system back to Detroit’s supply. 38 Two weeks 
later, Governor Snyder requested six million dollars from the state legislature to reconnect 
the Flint water system to Detroit. 39 With additional funding from the City and a private 
foundation, the switch was completed in mid-October. 40 

Following the switch back to Detroit water, some government officials began to ask 
questions about what went wrong in the course of Flint’s change in water sources. 41 
Governor Snyder created a task force to review water management and testing in Flint, 42 
and EPA established its own task force “to provide the Agency’s technical expertise through 
regular conversations” with the City and MDEQ. 43 Governor Snyder has also announced

plans to launch an “education campaign soon to help schools statewide learn how to get 
their water tested” for lead. 44 

Despite this proliferation of task forces and campaigns, neither the City nor MDEQ 
has announced changes in the City’s lead monitoring practices in the wake of Flint’s public- 
health crisis. Rather, Flint and MDEQ have maintained that these practices are accurate 
and adequate, despite the near certainty that they are underrepresenting lead contamination 
in many of Flint’s high-risk homes. 

II. City and State officials are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Lead 

and Copper Rule 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (the Act) authorizes citizens to sue any governmental 
entity “who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement” under the statute. 45 These 
requirements include the national primary drinking-water regulations for lead and copper 
set forth in the Dead and Copper Rule. 46 The Dead and Copper Rule obligates water systems 
to monitor and control for lead in drinking water. 47 

Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has failed to comply with the Fead and 
Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring water for lead, notifying the public of tap-water 
monitoring results, reporting monitoring results to MDEQ, and controlling corrosion from 
lead pipes. 48 These violations systematically result in the City’s underestimating lead levels 
in its drinking water, masking a public-health crisis. The violations are ongoing and likely to 
recur in the future: Flint’s water system presently is obligated to monitor for lead every six 
months, and there is no indication that Flint has changed or disavowed its inadequate 
approach to monitoring. 49 


44 See Lori Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 13,

47 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 141.86. 

48 Flint’s water system is subject to the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule because it is a

49 See Tamaska v. City of Bluff City, 26 F. App’x 482, 485 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Chesapeake Bay 
Found, v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, 844 F.2d 170, 171-72 (4th Cir. 1988)). A water system is required to 
monitor tap water for lead every six months if it (1) exceeds the action level for any monitoring 
period, or (2) “fails to operate at or above the minimum value or within tire range of values for tire 
water quality parameters specified by the State ... for more than 9 days in any six-month period.” 40 
C.F.R. § 141.86(d)(4)(vi)(B). Flint’s water system failed to maintain applicable values of 
orthophosphate and/or pH designated as the optimal water quality parameters by MDEQ. In 
addition, had the water system conducted monitoring in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule 
during the January to June 2015 period, it likely would have exceeded the lead action level.

Under the Act, a “supplier of water” is “any person who owns or operates a public 
water system.” 50 The City of Flint owns Flint’s water system. 51 Upon information and belief, 
the State officials administering Flint’s receivership and the City presently operate Flint’s 
water system. As discussed above, Flint’s Emergency Manager exercised the authority of 
the local government in the place of Flint’s mayor and city council. The Emergency 
Manager managed the water system and conducted its affairs, including making the 
decision to use the Flint River as a primary drinking-water source. 52 In April 2015, 

Governor Snyder removed the Emergency Manager and appointed a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board to oversee the City’s affairs until the receivership is terminated. 53 
The Board has control over the City’s budget, and must approve all decisions adopted by the 
City Council. 54 The Michigan Focal Financial Stability and Choice Act requires the State 
Treasurer to sit on a receivership transition advisory board for any municipality for which 
the governor appoints such a board, and Governor Snyder has appointed the State Treasurer 
(or his designee) to chair Flint’s Board. 55 The City Administrator reports to the Board, 
manages the City’s daily administrative operations, and directs City department heads in 
carrying out the daily activities of the City. 56 To date, the City remains in receivership, and 
its actions remain subject to approval of the Board. 57

and Beverly Walker-Griffea, Members of the Board; and Natasha Henderson, Flint City 
Administrator, are responsible for the violations of the Act by Flint’s water system which 
have endangered and will continue to endanger the health of Flint’s residents. 

A. Flint's water system is in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule's tap- 
water monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements 

The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify a pool of sampling 
sites prior to the commencement of a monitoring period. 58 This requirement is designed to 
target residences at high risk of lead contamination in drinking water, such as homes served 
by lead service lines. 59 In violation of the Rule, Flint’s water system does not select sampling 
sites for lead monitoring based on a pre-established sampling pool. For Flint’s most recent 
completed monitoring period, January- June 2015, the Director of the City’s Department of 
Public Works admitted that Flint “thr[ew] bottles out everywhere just to collect as many 
[samples] as we can, to try and hit our number.” 60 Similarly, email correspondence shows 
that the City has, during several monitoring periods, asked its own employees to submit tap- 
water samples, without regard to whether the employees were part of a pre-selected 
sampling pool. 61 

Under the Lead and Copper Rule, water systems that contain lead service lines also 
must draw fifty percent of their tap-water samples from sites served by a lead service line. 62 
Flint’s water system does not comply with this requirement. The water system reported to 
MDEQ that all the sample sites it used during the January-June 2015 monitoring period 
were residences served by lead service lines. 63 Flint’s Utilities Administrator, however, 
admitted that he was not able to verify that all homes sampled were served by lead service 
lines. 64 This is because City records concerning the locations of lead service lines in the 
distribution system are stored on 45,000 paper notecards. Flint began converting these 
notecards into an electronic spreadsheet this fall, well after the January-June 2015 
monitoring period. 65

Flint’s water system has also failed to sample the same sites across monitoring 
periods or document the reasons for declining to sample the same sites, as the Lead and 
Copper Rule requires. 66 Sampling new sites from one monitoring period to the next is 
permitted only if a site “is no longer accessible” to the water system or “no longer fits the 
requirements of a priority site.” 67 Records show that in the January-June 2015 monitoring 
period, Flint’s water system retested only thirteen of the one hundred sites it sampled in the 
previous monitoring period. 68 It did not provide the required explanation for these 
departures from the previous monitoring period’s sampling sites. 69 Upon information and 
belief, Flint’s water system concentrated its monitoring in areas where it anticipated low 
lead levels, due to recent infrastructure improvements, and selectively retested sites that had 
previously yielded low lead levels. Such selective sampling violates the Lead and Copper 
Rule’s intention that water systems “do not use only those sampling locations with the 
lowest lead or copper levels.” 70 

Flint’s instructions to residents for the collection of tap-water samples also violate the 
Lead and Copper Rule. The Rule allows residents to collect the tap-water samples used to 
monitor lead in drinking water, so long as the water system instructs residents of the 
sampling procedures required by the regulations. 71 Tap-water samples must be “first-draw 
samples,” meaning that the sample must be collected after water in the tap has stood 
motionless in the plumbing system for at least six hours. 72 Flint’s instructions direct 
residents to flush their taps for five minutes prior to letting the water sit for the six required 
hours. This “pre-flushing” has been shown to “result in the minimization of lead capture 
and significant underestimation of lead levels in drinking water.” 73 The water system’s pre- 
flush instruction “negates the intent of the [Lead and Copper Rule] to collect compliance

samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions,” 74 and goes “against the intent of the monitoring 
protocol, since it changes the normal water use of the homeowners in the sample.” 75 

Flint’s water system is violating the Lead and Copper Rule’s reporting requirements 
by representing to MDEQ that Flint’s monitoring practices are in compliance with the Rule. 
The City’s water system did not provide documentation to MDEQ justifying its selection of 
new sample sites in the January-June 2015 monitoring period, and, upon information and 
belief, is not accurately reporting information concerning whether sampled sites meet 
required regulatory criteria. 76 

The Lead and Copper Rule also requires Flint’s water system to notify each resident 
whose tap water was sampled of the lead results. 77 Upon information and belief, Flint has 
failed and continues to fail to properly notify all residents whose tap water was tested for 
lead of the individual monitoring results. 

B. Flint's water system has failed to maintain optimal corrosion-control 
treatment 

The Lead and Copper Rule required all large public water systems, including Flint’s 
water system, to install an “optimal corrosion control treatment” program by January 1 , 

199 7. 78 After a system has optimized its corrosion-control treatment, the regulations require 
the system to “continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment.” 79 
Since April 2014, Flint’s water system has not maintained an optimal corrosion-control 
treatment program. Historically, the water system complied with the corrosion-control 
requirements by purchasing treated water from Detroit. When Flint switched its water 
source to the Flint River in April 2014, it did nothing to treat the Flint River water to 
control corrosion. This failure to maintain optimized corrosion control violates the Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

Although Flint’s water system has resumed its purchase of treated water from 
Detroit, it has not disavowed its erroneous interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule’s 
corrosion-control requirements. Nor has it committed to maintaining optimized corrosion 
control when it switches water sources again this summer to the KWA pipeline. Flint’s 
water system’s failure to maintain an optimized corrosion-control treatment program is 
likely to recur in the future.

III. The State of Michigan's failure to maintain a schools testing and remediation 
program violates the Safe Drinking Water Act 

The Act requires each state to establish a program “to assist” schools and day care 
centers in “testing for, and remedying, lead contamination in drinking water.” 80 Test results 
must be made available at schools, with notification to parents and teachers. 81 Michigan, 
upon information and belief, does not maintain a program for school lead testing, 
remediation, and notification. 82 Accordingly, Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Wyant 
are presently in violation of the Act’s schools provision. 83 

IV. Intent to Sue 

The City of Flint and Michigan state officials have been and continue to be in 
violation of the Tead and Copper Rule’s requirements for monitoring and sampling tap 
water for lead, notifying the public of and reporting to the State tap-water monitoring 
results, and corrosion control. Governor Snyder and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant are in 
violation of the Act’s requirement to maintain a program to assist Michigan schools with 
testing and remediating lead in school drinking water. These violations are likely to 
continue and to recur in the future absent a judicial decree ordering City and State officials 
to comply with the Act. If the City of Flint and the Michigan state officials identified above 
fail to cure their noncompliance with the Act within sixty days, Concerned Pastors for 
Social Action, Melissa Mays, ACTU of Michigan, and NRDC will file suit in federal 
district court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and litigation costs, as appropriate. 

The name, address, and telephone number of each person giving notice pursuant to 
this letter are:

82 Although MDEQ recently announced “an education campaign” to help Michigan schools 
learn how to test their water for lead, MDEQ has yet to release the details of this effort, including 
whether it will offer the kind of assistance with testing, remediation, and notification contemplated 
by the Safe Drinking Water Act. See Higgins, Michigan to launch lead education effort statewide, supra 
note 44 (Ex. 51).

WDET) will be call screening. 

• Michigan Radio station manager Steve Schram will greet the governor upon arrival. (No record of RDS meeting him 
previously). The news director is Vince Duffy . Expect that he may join brief meet and greet too. 

• Listeners can tune in via WUOM 91.7 FM in SE Ml, WFUM 91.1 FM in Flint, and WVGR 104.1 FM in West ML Will 
also be carried live on all other public radio stations across the state. 

• Will also steam live with video at michiganradio.org 

• Taking advance and during broadcast Qs via social media - hashtag #MICallling on Twitter; and at "Michigan 
Calling" on Facebook. 

• Callers with Qs can dial 866-255-2762. 

• There will be two brief 1-2 minute breaks at 9:19 a.m. and again at 9:39 a.m. 

• The UM media team will be having videographer and photographer on site and the student newspaper Michigan 
Daily will also likely be on site too. 

• They will have strong screening in place to help ensure appropriate grouping of topics and that the show isn't 
dominated by callers with agendas like Progress Ml. 

• Progress Ml is undertaking push to have their members call-in to "hold the governor accountable and ask the tough 
Qs about his pro-corporate agenda." 

• Comms team is pushing out to various and key stakeholders via the RPA report, a Reinvention News newletter to 
subscribers, and on social media. The roads coalition is also pushing out. We will also advise it to media on Friday. 

• FYI: WDET (one of public radio affiliates in Detroit) announced this week that Stephen Henderson has been named 
permanent host of their newer 9-10 a.m. hour show called "Detroit Today." Stephen will still retain his Free Press 
post and DPTV MiWeek co-hosting with Nolan and Christy McDonald, http://wdet.org/shows/detroit-

Subject: PIO report 

Sorry I missed the meeting. Had a couple conflicts. Here’s what I want to share with you: 

1 . Farm Discharge in Fulton: We’ve got an active manure discharge to surface waters from a 
farm in Fulton. Ch. 3 is on their way out there right now. Short story, a CAFO ‘manifested’ its 
liquid manure to another farmer, that guy applied it to his fields in a bad spot, and then the 
weather warmed up. Because of the location, I’m confident Lynn Henning will turn this into a 
circus very soon. 

2. Composting woes in Cooper Township: There’s a spicemaker in Kalamazoo County, 

Cooper Township, has for several years been composting its organic byproducts. They’re 
doing this in full accordance with the law, and they’re doing it the way it is supposed to be 
done. Neighbors of the agricultural field where they’re doing the composting are unhappy, like 
most neighbors of composting. They’ve gotten in touch with state officials early this year, and 
they’re picking up neighborhood momentum, calling DEQ and MDARD directors yesterday 
when they didn’t get what they wanted from district and division DEQ staff. Likely this issue will 
be in the press soon. 

3. Flint Water: had a meeting yesterday with a company Baird put in the room to discuss their 
ozone technology. It was a good conversation but a non-starter for several reasons (Flint 
already has an Ozone system to modify its water, this company hasn’t had its system certified 
for use on public drinking water supplies, and the problem they propose to address is not at 
the water plant but throughout various sections of the distribution system). More broadly, 
Harvey is looking for a ‘thing’ the state can be doing for Flint that will position SOM / RS 
positively. Suggestions range from handing out home water filters (think Britta faucet mount) to 
passing out jugs of water. After consulting with our experts in the Drinking water program, what 
we’ve really come to at DEQ is that if there’s funding from treasury (or some charitable donor 
foundation), the best short-term use of dollars would probably be to hire a company to ‘pig’ the 
lines in the distribution system. This is a routine maintenance activity in municipal systems that 
involves an in-line device under pressure that clears funk out of the lines. The good news on 
Flint : Flint EM Jerry Ambrose noted yesterday that the city has some work to do on its system 
in the weeks ahead; the TTHM issue is quickly going away; the ‘brown water’ folks are loud but 
really few in number; the consultants are doing their work to make suggestions to help the city 
prioritize its needs; and, broadly, nobody seems to be targeting the administration recently. 


i 



4. Net pen aquaculture in the Great Lakes: We’ve gotten three proposals from companies that 
want to raise rainbow trout in the open waters of the Great lakes. The most imminent proposal 
is from a Canadian company looking to put offshore net pens in Little Bay DeNoc. This would 
be the first time a Great Lakes state got into the net pen business in the lakes. The three QOL 
agencies have come together to form a work group and study the issue, bringing in experts 
from Canada, Wisconsin, academia, industry, government, etc. Suffice to say, we want to 
support the growth of aquaculture, but we won’t put the lakes in harm’s way so the bar is high. 
We’re planning to lead this story with AP yet this week. Will consult with you all to make sure 
you’re in the loop prior to pulling the trigger. Draft talking points enclosed. 

5. Sulfur Dioxide in Detroit: Our Air Quality folks are hosting a permit hearing for DTE tomorrow 
night. Detroit News is covering it today. See story 

here: http://www.detroitnews.com/storv/news/locaj/michiqan/2015/03/09/michiqans-tactics- 
cutting-air-pollutiQn-fire/246832Q9/ 

6. DEQ fracking rules: We expect them to emerge from JCAR this week. No hearing. They then 
move to the Office of the Great Seal, where they are officialized and become Rules. This is 
good news. This rule package protects water supplies, standardizes some best practices 
related to well monitoring for neighbors of fracturing sites, and increases public access to 
information about gas and oil development.

RE: Flint 


Not yet, but hopefully will be. Think got Dennis and Harvey on same page about tying in other HHS/Hurley news to part 
of action plan on Friday's announcement. DEQand DHHS teams trying to finalize policy and messaging drafts now for 
review. 1:30 p.m. mtg to walk through details and see where at. 

Also - heads up and FYI - we just had a major protocol and near security breach with WJRT TV 12 getting up to 2nd floor 
without our knowledge or escort. Apparently DK Security and other EO team though they were part of pastors meeting 
happening. (Apparently invited by the pastors). That's caused some excitement have been dealing with. They're on our 
comms floor now - doing a stand up with them and letting them catch pastors after meeting outside.

Hi there Charlie - 

More than happen to help and walk you through history and past efforts as well as comprehensive action plan that the 
Governor and Administration just outlined this past week. Called earlier and got VM, left a message. 

Please just let me know what you may need or want, or call back at office line below. (Our IT team has my cell phone 
currently due to some tech issues and repairs so unfortunately that's not an option at the moment - though hopefully 
that will be addressed and fixed asap).

RE: Treasury 


Many thanks, Jeremy, Much appreciated. 

To be dear then, there WERE other reports and documents since that 2013 date? I thought there had been at least two, 
but couldn't recall exact timing or access the reports. Well want to make sure we have handy if so. 

Think it was great Matt D talked to Nick about that. I think the story overall turned out well and covered potential 
pension without overhyping or scaring.

Sara- 

Wanted to update you on a couple of potential stories that you could see over the weekend. 

First Nancy Kaffer of the Freep is writing a column for Sunday to do with Flint and the choice of KWA over DWSD. She 
had FOIA'd a doc from MEDQthat had a 2013 report from Andy Dillion that says that KWA is a risky proposition and that 
DWSD was a better option. I let her know that the report was just a starting point in the process and as more 
information became available a joint decision was made by the EM, council and other key city leaders. 


Let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks.

Re: Flint and DWSD- IMPORTANT 


From Matt Schenk tonight, after I asked him about whether another offer is in the making: 

Sue did reach out to flint to get their latest requirements so that we can make another offer. 

I am back on Monday to get a sense of where we are. I know that Orr was also briefed and had some concerns about 
how losing flint as a customer could negatively impact our value. 

I will shoot a quick email to Kevyn to see if he needs any more information.

I think Ed should respond to McCormick. ! wouldn't have reacted quite so negatively, but then that's me. I would 
encourage him to always stress that they are open to new proposals, but haven't seen one. But, I'm in no position to 
rewrite emails. I do think that a dean closure on both sides is warranted. It's not like KWA wouldn't still need a 
negotiating posture with DWSD. 


What was Sue's response to the request for a last best offer? I take it she wasn't interested, or at least didn't feel that 
she could offer any more than previously done? Schenk's about as good as you can get in public life, so with Sue if they 
don't have an offer, I can't figure out what we can do more. I'm really surprised that DWSD hasn't responded with a 
final counter. 

Sounds like the well is pretty poisoned (no pun intended).

Redacted 


7) Water Issues 

a) Two more areas had five day boil- water notices - resolved, broken 24” valve was a major 
contributor to the problem. 

b) Flint will continue to investigate why conditions develop which are favorable for more 
severe problems to occur. Pursuing these investigations may include seeking additional 
professional assistance to review both systems and processes. 




c) General Motors Water Issues - working through lawyers at this point. However, if this 
should become an issue for the GCDC with DWSD we would hope Treasury will be 
supportive of the GM-GCDC franchise customer agreement.

POTENTIAL WAYS THE STATE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP KWA 
EXPEDITE PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION 


1 . Eliminate frost law restrictions (this would add two months of construction) 

2. Additional financing: - Contracts have been let 

Reason: - Need cash to allow subcontracts 

- Need cash to expedite pipe production 

- Funding can come through mega or warrants to 
pipe manufacturer or additional rules on 
DWRF/SRF 

- Funding could come from the roadway funding as 
direct grants to local road commission to free up 
funds for pipeline work 


3. Act 233 Agencies - State Permit - similar to public schools 

Reason: - Projects bigger than local community 

- Public safety of the larger community outweighs 
local politics 

- Big project - locals not equipped to handle

Subject: FOIA request from ACLU 

We have now received a FOIA request from Curt Guyette with ACLU regarding using the Flint River as a source of 
municipal drinking water. This request is much more extensive that the previous request from Rep. Phil Phelps, which 
we denied as he was only asking for applications, permits or waivers to use the Flint River. In that request we indicated 
that Treasury did not have any such records and referred him to DEQ. However, this request is somewhat broader. The 
actual request is attached, but here is what he is asking for: 

Under the provisions of Michigan's Freedom of Information Act, I respectfully request that the Michigan Department 
of Treasury, or its agents, provide me with the following records, documents and any other related materials covering 
the period from Jan. 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014: 

0) <! — [if IsupportLists]— ><!— [endif]-->AIl reports, studies, analyses, memoranda, and similar 
records evaluating the suitability and/or feasibility of using the Flint River as a source of 
municipal drinking water. 

(2) <! — [if ! supportLists] — ><! — [endif] — >A11 reports, studies, analyses, memoranda and similar 
records that include evaluations of the economic impact of using the Flint River as a source 
of municipal drinking water. 

(3) <! — [if ! supportLists] — ><! — [endif] — >A11 documents, reports, memoranda and similar 
records involving permit applications and waivers related to the use of the Flint River as a 
municipal water source. 





(4) <! — [if ! supportLists] — ><! — [endif] — >A1I communications, including but not limited to 

electronic communications, sent and received by the Michigan Department of Treasury, or 
its agents, related the use or potential use of the Flint River as a municipal water source 
and/or the water quality of the Flint River. Included in this request are all communications 
containing information, comments and opinions about the use of the Flint River as a 
municipal water source, the economic impact of using the Flint River as a municipal water 
source as well as communications related to any permitting process involving the Flint 
River. This request for communications includes, but is not limited to, all communications 
with any elected or appointed government officials; and any unit of municipal, county, 
state or federal government regarding or related to items (1), (2) and (3) listed above. 

Randy: I know you have already checked your records (in response to the Phelps request) and provided some to 
me. However, due to the fact that this request is different than the previous request, please let me know if there are 
any additional records which you may not have previously provided. 

Wendy: I believe you already performed a search of e-mails belonging to Andy Dillon, Kevin Clinton, Brom Stibitz, and 
Ashley Gelisse. Again, let me know if you think there are any additional records. 

I do not believe I have received records from anyone else yet. 

Please note that he is only asking for records from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014. 

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

To Whom It May Concern, 

Under the provisions of Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act, I respectfully request that the 
Michigan Department of Treasury, or its agents, provide me with the following records, documents and 
any other related materials covering the period from Jan. 1, 201 1 to June 30, 2014: 


(1) All reports, studies, analyses, memoranda, and similar records evaluating the suitability 
and/or feasibility of using the Flint River as a source of municipal drinking water. 

(2) All reports, studies, analyses, memoranda and similar records that include evaluations of 
the economic impact of using the Flint River as a source of municipal drinking water. 

(3) All documents, reports, memoranda and similar records involving permit applications and 
waivers related to the use of the Flint River as a municipal water source. 

(4) All communications, including but not limited to electronic communications, sent and 
received by the Michigan Department of Treasury, or its agents, related the use or 
potential use of the Flint River as a municipal water source and/or the water quality of the 
Flint River. Included in this request are all communications containing information, 
comments and opinions about the use of the Flint River as a municipal water source, the 
economic impact of using the Flint River as a municipal water source as well as 
communications related to any permitting process involving the Flint River. This request 
for communications includes, but is not limited to, all communications with any elected 
or appointed government officials; and any unit of municipal, county, state or federal 
government regarding or related to items (1), (2) and (3) listed above. 


Exempt Records 


Should you decide to invoke a FOIA exemption as the basis for withholding any record responsive to 
this request, please include in your full or partial denial letter sufficient information for the ACLU of 
Michigan to appeal the denial pursuant to MCL 15.235(4)(a). To comply with legal requirements, the 
following information must be included: 

1. Basic factual material about each withheld item, including the originator, date, length, 
general subject matter, and location of each item; and 

2. Explanations and justifications for denial, including the identification of the category within 
the governing statutory provision under which the document (or portion thereof) was 
withheld and a full explanation of how each exemption fits the withheld material. 

If you determine that portions of a record requested are exempt from disclosure, please redact the 
exempt portions and provide the remainder of the record to the ACLU of Michigan. 

Format of Records Requested 

To reduce or avoid the costs and labor of printing and/or photocopying records, we request that records 
be provided in electronic format wherever possible if that is the least-costly option, including but not 
limited to records that are stored or maintained in electronic format. We will provide a USB drive or 
other media storage device for the records at our expense if requested. 

Fee Waiver Request 

The ACLU of Michigan requests that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 
MCL 15.234(1) (waiver of fee is appropriate where search for and provision of copies of the public 
record can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public). The ACLU of Michigan will use 
the information to contribute significantly to public understanding of water issues in Flint. The ACLU 
of Michigan will make all records received available to the public. The ACLU of Michigan is a non- 
profit organization registered as a charitable organization in Michigan, with no commercial interest in 
obtaining the requested information. 

Willingness to Pay Fees Under Protest 


While a fee waiver should be granted for the reasons set forth above, the ACLU of Michigan is seeking 
these records regardless of the MDEQ’s ultimate decision on the fee waiver request. The ACLU of 
Michigan thus is willing to pay fees in keeping with the applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements, if necessary and under protest, to enable the timely delivery of the records. Fees must be 
limited to actual costs of labor and copying, and the means for copying must be the most economical 



available. MC'L 15.234(1) and (3). Furthermore, fees may only be assessed based on procedures and 
guidelines published by the MDEQ. Id. at (3). 

Please notify me if costs exceed $500. 


Record Delivery 


Pursuant to MCL 15.232(2), we expect a response to this request within 5 business days. We request the 
MEDQ, in responding to this request, to comply with all relevant deadlines and other obligations set 
forth in the Michigan FOIA. To reduce or avoid the costs and labor of printing and/or photocopying 
records, if it is the most cost-effective way we request that records be provided in electronic format 
wherever possible, including but not limited to records that are stored or maintained in electronic format. 
We will provide a USB drive or other media storage device for the records at our expense. 

Please produce the requested records on a rolling basis; at no point should the search for - or 
deliberation concerning - certain records delay the production of others that the Michigan Department of 
Treasury has already retrieved and elected to produce. 

Please contact me so that I can pick obtain these records as soon as possible. If you find that this request 
is unclear in any way please contact me immediately so I can clarify the request or otherwise expedite 
and simplify your efforts to comply. 

Sincerely,

Re: Increase in average day and maximum peak day by GCDC 

Dear Mr. Wolfson: 

The Genesee County Drain Commissioner's Office, Division of Water and Waste Sendees 
("GCDC”) has been working diligently to fulfill the demands of the various state and federal agencies, 
Governor Snyder, and the people of the City of Flint ("Flint”), to provide Flint with water from the 
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department ("DWSD”). These efforts include placing approximately seven 
(7) miles of the seventy-two inch (72”) water transmission pipeline ("Pipeline”) that GCDC purchased 
from Flint back into service, pressurizing the Pipeline, disinfecting the Pipeline, flushing the Pipeline, and 
performing Bac-T testing on the water inside of the Pipeline. Once these efforts have materialized and 
GCDC has received two (2) negative Bac-T tests, GCDC will be in a tactical position to furnish DWSD 
water to Flint as early as midweek. 

On October 8, 2015, I sent you a letter after GCDC received a formal request from Flint for 
GCDC to provide DWSD water to Flint pursuant to a previous written agreement between GCDC and 
Flint. As of today, I have not received your response, hi the October 8, 2015, letter I requested the 
following: 

GCDC has received a fonnal request from Flint to receive DWSD water via GCDC per 
GCDC's contract with Flint. GCDC's rates are currently based on 12 mgd average day 
and 25 mgd maximum peak day. Does DWSD have the capacity to increase demand to 
GCDC to 28.5 mgd average day and 51 mgd peak day? If so. could you please provide 
GCDC with the rates for 28.5 mgd average and 51 mgd peak day through June 30, 2016? 

Attorney Anthony Chubb from Flint has provided me with a proposed WATER SERVICE 
CONTRACT BETWEEN CITY OF DETROIT AND CITY OF FLINT ("Contract”). Tins Contract 
makes the assumption that Flint has a separate connection to the DWSD water distribution system. The 
interconnect between the DWSD water system and the Flint water system is owned by GCDC. Flint does 
not have a separate connection to the DWSD water distribution system. Any water that Flint receives 


WWW. M CG R A WM O RRIS.CO M 




Mr. Wolfson 
October 12, 2015 
Page 2 


from DWSD is required to flow through GN-01. Additionally, GCDC has received no communication 
from DWSD on this subject since the Flint water issue surfaced. Simply stated, DWSD has the ability to 
sendee Flint with water only through the interconnect owned by GCDC. 

GCDC is working diligently to move forward with Flint receiving DWSD water; however, 
GCDC cannot do anything until it has an agreement with DWSD and Flint as to how the DWSD water 
will be transmitted to Flint. Right now, Flint is requesting GCDC to provide DWSD water GN-01 
pursuant to the written agreement between GCDC and Flint. Additionally, Flint has also request DWSD 
to provide Flint with water with the understanding that DWSD has no way to transmit the water to Flint. 
There is no question that Flint wants and eventually w ill be serviced with DWSD water; however, DWSD 
and Flint cannot continually ignore the fact that GCDC owns and operates the interconnect between 
DWSD and Flint. 

GCDC has been working diligently to assist Flint in receiving DWSD water; however, DWSD to 
date has been unwilling to provide GCDC the information it needs so that Flint may switch over the 
DWSD water. When you have prepared your response, please send it to kkilby@mcgrawmorris.com or 
contact Director John O’Brien at 810-732-7870. 


Sincerely, 


MCGRAW MORRIS P.C.

GCDC has received a fonnal request from Flint to receive DWSD water via GCDC per GCDC's 
contract with Flint. GCDC s rates are currently based on 12 mgd average day and 25 mgd maximum 
peak day. Does DWSD have the capacity to increase demand to GCDC to 28.5 mgd average day and 51

peak day through June 30, 2016? 

As you are aware, time is of the essence. I would respectfully ask that if at all possible you could 
provide answers to the above two (2) questions stated above by 5:00 p.m. today. It is anticipated that if 
DWSD has the capacity and all of the issues between Flint and GCDC are resolved, GCDC anticipates 
providing Treated Water to Flint within the next seven (7) days. 

If you should have any questions or concerns regarding this communication, please feel free to

i am not sure how you are reading that?... I see $10mm going to DWSD from Flint. 

Just keep in mind we are sending them $4mm. We already sent them $2mm. They were to put in $2mm of their own & 
$2mm was suppose to come from Mott. And can't say for sure but Mott may have only kicked in $lmm at this 
point, [but that is between the City & Mott] Sygo was going to call Mott to iet them know what we are doing.

Great to see the Op-Ed, I'm tired of seeing good people getting kicked around without a chance to set the record 
straight. 


l 


Frankly, the everyday Flint citizen has been very poorly served by these folks, and without help the city would have been 
bankrupt and my guess the problem exacerbated. Every single one of us is very disappointed and disheartened by the 
lead issue, and no one, especially you and i, thinks lead is acceptable at any level even though the feds recognize that a 
certain level is to be expected. A regular Flint citizen has every right to be ticked off by the findings, and I certainly don't 
blame them for being irritated they have this problem, need bottled water and filters, etc., but it's the old pipes that are 
the problem. 

Lead doesn't magically appear or disappear because of the Flint River water, which we all, including you, expressed a lot 
of reservation about using. But, the river was always the back-up long before EM's and state involvement, and the locals 
went forward with the same understandings. Frankly, the response to the "dirty" water and the smell obviously 
precipitated chemical cures which may or may not have facilitated the leaching. Some of the levels will be relieved by 
the Lake Huron water, but not the essential issue in old cities throughout the country where the only resolution to lead 
levels is getting rid of old houses with lead issues and old pipes. Quite an undertaking, but without a viable city it could 
never be tackled.

Subject: PRESS RELEASE: Emergency Manager Transition Update to City Council 

For Immediate Release 

EM Updates Council, Requests support for Emergency Loan and District Court Consolidation; 
Adjusts Salaries for Mayor and Council 

Flint, Michigan - April 13, 2015 - By letter to City Council issued today, Emergency Manager 
Jerry Ambrose congratulated City Council for their recent actions committing to restoring and 
maintaining the City’s financial solvency. Mr. Ambrose stated that recent actions to adopt a 
series of ordinances requiring commitment to establishing appropriate financial reserves and an 
improved planning and budgeting process indicate that the Council understands the need to 
restore and maintain Flint’s financial solvency. “While there is much yet to do, these are positive 
steps in the right direction,” said Mr. Ambrose. “The ongoing challenge will be to adhere to the 
requirements the City Council has adopted themselves.” 

Mr. Ambrose’s letter also reiterated the priority issues currently facing the City - developing a 
long range financial plan, beginning with the upcoming FY16 and FY17 budget; continuing to 
address concerns with water safety, quality and affordability; and stabilizing resources for public 
safety. “These are clearly the top priority issues, and ones which require the cooperation of all if 
they are to be successfully addressed,” stated Mr. Ambrose. “Unfortunately, resources are 
extremely limited, and we must make decisions which address the most critical issues in a 
financially sound manner - and that often means we cannot do everything everybody wants.” 


Some of the ingredients of restoring Flint’s financial solvency on a sustainable basis, according 
to Mr. Ambrose, include obtaining a $7 million loan to finance the accumulated General Fund 
deficit and approving the consolidation of the 67th and 68th District Courts. Both issues are 
pending before City Council and Mr. Ambrose is hopeful for a quick positive response. “The 
terms and conditions offered with this loan equate to a good deal for the City and will enable it to 
begin to more quickly rebuild its financial solvency. Approving the court consolidation will 


l 



reduce City expenses by $8.4 million over the next 10 years and will help to provide some 
stability in funding other public safety services.” 

Mr. Ambrose also presented Council with actions he is taking to continue the progress towards 
transition, including an updated purchasing ordinance and an order officially defining the role of 
the new City Administrator as the chief administrative officer for the City. “Moving the City 
forward in today’s environment requires professional managers, clear responsibilities, and 
modern practices,” said Ambrose. “These actions move in that direction, and hopefully move the 
Council forward in truly becoming the governing body of the City, focused on policies and 
accountability for moving the City forward based on its vision, mission, and goals.” 

Recognizing the increasing role of the Mayor and Council as the City transitions to home rule 
with oversight by a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Mr. Ambrose announced that he is 
reestablishing the salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place before the City was most 
recently placed into state receivership. He noted that Council meetings are now held twice per 
month, with committee meetings held once per month, and the Mayor is now much more 
engaged in a Chief Executive role. Continued receipt of the re-established salaries, however, will 
be contingent upon attainment of certain training levels. These training levels were established in 
prior orders of the Emergency Manager, and Councilmembers will have until November 1, 2015 
to obtain it, or their salary will be reduced to the current level.

Much progress has been made in preparing for the transition, including action by the City Council 
to complete the following: 

• Final adoption of the Capital Improvements Plan 

• Final adoption of ordinances regarding planning, budgeting, funds balance, and deficit 
elimination 

• Update of the Strategic Plan’s Vison, Mission, and Goals 

• Adoption of budget priorities to guide development of the F Y1 6/F Y 1 7 budget 

Additionally, our new City Administrator Natasha Henderson is on board and is assuming duties 
as the experienced and professionally trained chief administrative officer for the City. 

There are several issues which we are continuing to address, including: 

• Water safety, quality, and affordability continues to be a top priority. The City’s water 
supply today is safe, as measured by the same MDEQ standards that have been in place for 
years, and steps are being taken to improve treatment and distribution processes in order to 
address issues of discoloration and odor, and to assure continued safety. Reviews of our 
pricing structure are also underway to assure that customers are treated equitably while 
generating sufficient revenue to operate the system. 

Public safety continues to be an area of critical concern. The independent study of our 
police and fire organization provided a number of recommendations focused on how to 
best deploy the resources we have, and also confirmed that the staffing levels afforded by 
our limited resources are extremely low in comparison to comparable municipalities. 

This emphasizes the critical continuing importance of renewing the two voter-approved 
public safety millages and working to assure continuing state support through the 
assignment of state troopers and through financial support of the City lock-up. Loss of 
any of this support would be a disaster for the City. 

• Achieving and then maintaining financial stability will continue to require constant 
attention. Approval of the ordinances regarding financial stability and the anticipated 
approval of the $7 million loan provide additional tools with which to work. Attention will 
need to be paid to not only developing and adopting budgets for FY16 and FY17 but doing 
so in the context of understanding the impact of those budgetary decisions into the 
following three years. Essential to this is making the budget decisions which truly address 
achievement of the stated vison, mission and goals for the City as adopted by the City 
Council. Unfortunately, the challenges in doing so will be great, as the City will continue 
to be faced with the reality of a structural deficit, where for the foreseeable future current 
expenditure patterns exceed revenue streams - a difficult position, given the City’s already 
low level of services. Complicating this further is the potential impact of the retiree health 
care lawsuit, once the final outcome is decided.

• Finally progress continues with modernizing the operations of the City and setting the 
framework for future development. With the Master Plan and Capital Improvement Plan 
in place, focus is now turning to implementation, including updating the Zoning Ordinance. 

As we move forward with preparing for transition, there is much work yet to do. Today I am taking 
three actions consistent with our path: 

• Adoption of an updated purchasing policy - 1 am enacting the revisions to the Purchasing 
policy which were reviewed by Council within the past few months. These changes are 
made with the goal of assuring that the process of obtaining goods and services is consistent 
with the expectations of the Strategic Plan. There must be proper oversight and 
transparency, with a goal of obtaining goods and services that best meet the needs of City 
departments. The process must ensure competitive procurement, conducted in a timely and 
ethical manner. The City Council has an. important role in assuring compliance with the 
policy, which is not the same as conducting purchasing operations. 

• Confirming the role of the City Administrator - Before the search for a new City 
Administrator was begun, it was determined, within the context of the Seven Point 
Transition Plan, that an experienced and professional City Administrator would be selected 
on the basis of an open competitive process, and that the duties of the City Administrator 
would be structured in a manner which assures the ability to manage and direct the 
administrative affairs of the City in a professional manner. While those duties and 
expectations were described in the job description of the City Administrator and in 
recruitment materials, I am now formally enacting them in Emergency Manager Order 
Number 3. 

• Re-establishing salaries for Mayor and Council - As we are moving towards transition, the 
duties and responsibilities of the Mayor and City Council are expanding towards the 
traditional roles of a City operating under home rule. Council meetings are now held twice 
per month, with committee meetings held once per month. The Mayor is now much more 
engaged in a Chief Executive role. Consequently, I have determined to re-establish the 
salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place immediately prior to the appointment 
of an Emergency Manager in November, 2011. Continued receipt of the re-established 
salaries, however, is contingent upon attainment of certain training. The re-established 
levels, and the contingency regarding training, is found in Emergency Manager Order 
Number 4. 

Over the next several weeks, there will be much work with respect to finalizing the loan application 
and developing the FY16 and FY17 budgets along with FY18, FY19, and FY20 projections. Work 
will also continue with implementing improvements of the water system, and reviewing our 
associated rate structure. Evaluation and implementation of the recommendations for best use of 



Flint City Council 
April 13, 2015

police and fire resources will continue, including corrective action for the police evidence room 
issues. Summer street maintenance and repair programs, as well as sidewalk repairs will soon be 
underway. Public meetings regarding the zoning ordinance are being held, with a recommended 
updated ordinance expected for consideration in late spring. A revision to the City’s business 
licensing ordinance is expected soon. These are but a few of the many activities to be expected as 
the City makes the best use of its resources to provide the best level of service it can within the 
resources it has. 

I look forward to working with you as we move towards transition to home rule under the guidance 
of a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. Please contact me if you have any questions.

For Immediate Release lMeo^@dtyoff»nl.com 

EM Updates Council, Requests support for Emergency Loan and 
District Court Consolidation; Adjusts Salaries for Mayor and Council 

Flint, Michigan - April 13, 2015 - By letter to City Council issued today, Emergency 
Manager Jerry Ambrose congratulated City Council for their recent actions committing to 
restoring and maintaining the City’s financial solvency. Mr. Ambrose stated that recent 
actions to adopt a series of ordinances requiring commitment to establishing appropriate 
financial reserves and an improved planning and budgeting process indicate that the 
Council understands the need to restore and maintain Flint’s financial solvency. “While 
there is much yet to do, these are positive steps in the right direction,” said Mr. Ambrose. 
“The ongoing challenge will be to adhere to the requirements the City Council has adopted 
themselves.” 

Mr. Ambrose’s letter also reiterated the priority issues currently facing the City - 
developing a long range financial plan, beginning with the upcoming FY16 and FY17 
budget; continuing to address concerns with water safety, quality and affordability; and 
stabilizing resources for public safety. “These are clearly the top priority issues, and ones 
which require the cooperation of all if they are to be successfully addressed,” stated Mr. 
Ambrose. “Unfortunately, resources are extremely limited, and we must make decisions 
which address the most critical issues in a financially sound manner - and that often 
means we cannot do everything everybody wants.” 

Some of the ingredients of restoring Flint’s financial solvency on a sustainable basis, 

according to Mr. Ambrose, include obtaining a $7 million loan to finance the accumulated

General Fund deficit and approving the consolidation of the 67th and 68th District Courts. 
Both issues are pending before City Council and Mr. Ambrose is hopeful for a quick 
positive response. “The terms and conditions offered with this loan equate to a good deal 
for the City and will enable it to begin to more quickly rebuild its financial solvency. 
Approving the court consolidation will reduce City expenses by $8.4 million over the next 
10 years and will help to provide some stability in funding other public safety services.” 

Mr. Ambrose also presented Council with actions he is taking to continue the progress 
towards transition, including an updated purchasing ordinance and an order officially 
defining the role of the new City Administrator as the chief administrative officer for the 
City. “Moving the City forward in today’s environment requires professional managers, 
clear responsibilities, and modern practices,” said Ambrose. “These actions move in that 
direction, and hopefully move the Council forward in truly becoming the governing body 
of the City, focused on policies and accountability for moving the City forward based on 
its vision, mission, and goals.” 

Recognizing the increasing role of the Mayor and Council as the City transitions to home 
rule with oversight by a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Mr. Ambrose announced 
that he is reestablishing the salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place before 
the City was most recently placed into state receivership. He noted that Council meetings 
are now held twice per month, with committee meetings held once per month, and the 
Mayor is now much more engaged in a Chief Executive role. Continued receipt of the re- 
established salaries, however, will be contingent upon attainment of certain training 
levels. These training levels were established in prior orders of the Emergency Manager, 
and Council members will have until November 1 , 2015 to obtain it, or their salary will be 
reduced to the current level.

I had not forgotten about this request... Joe F. pulled some background/numbers for me. DEQ controls it in

» Flint, Michigan - September 18, 2015-Flint Mayor Dayne Walling will be travelling to our nation's capital to join a 
White House delegation welcoming Pope Francis to the White House during his trip to the United States. Pope Francis 
will arrive in Washington, D.C. on September 22 and will be greeted the following day during a ceremony hosted by 
President and First Lady Obama on the White House's South Lawn. Mayor Walling will be joined by City Attorney Pete 
Bade to represent Flint in a welcome delegation of officials and leaders from around the country. 

» 

» "As a person of deep Christian faith and strong patriotism, there is no place in the world I would rather be that day 
than on the South Lawn of the White House with the President and First Lady to welcome the Pope. I am honored to be 
able to attend this once in a lifetime experience and represent our great City of Flint," said Walling. The Mayor is a long 
time, active member of the Court Street Methodist Church. 

» 

» City Attorney Pete Bade, who will be the Mayor's guest to the ceremony, is a devout Catholic and a member of St. 
John Vianney Catholic Church in Flint. Bade says he feels honored and blessed to join Mayor Walling for this historic visit. 
"In the past two and half years, Pope Francis has captured the world's attention with his humility and constant message 
of compassion for the poor," said Bade. 

» 

» The welcome ceremony for the Pope is the primary focus of the Mayor's trip to D.C., but while there he will also be 
meeting with federal representatives to discuss matters important to the City of Flint. Additional information on the 
Mayor's schedule during his trip will be made available on Monday, September 21. The Mayor and City Attorney's visit 
to Washington, D.C. is being paid for by each of them personally and will not cost the City of Flint in any way.

POTENTIAL WAYS THE STATE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP KWA 
EXPEDITE PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION 


1 . Eliminate frost law restrictions (this would add two months of construction) 

2. Additional financing: - Contracts have been let 

Reason: - Need cash to allow subcontracts 

- Need cash to expedite pipe production 

- Funding can come through mega or warrants to 
pipe manufacturer or additional rules on 
DWRF/SRF 

- Funding could come from the roadway funding as 
direct grants to local road commission to free up 
funds for pipeline work 


3. Act 233 Agencies - State Permit - similar to public schools 

Reason: - Projects bigger than local community 

- Public safety of the larger community outweighs 
local politics 

- Big project - locals not equipped to handle 

- Benefits KWA - GLWA and others 


4. State aid to local road commissioners’ public right-of-way 

Reason: - Project is outside their ability to cope/handle 

- KWA could concentrate on building pipeline; 
local road commission could concentrate on 
clean-up 


5. a. Clear requirements on road replacement/road repairs and utilities use of 
right-of-way 

b. No at will permits 

c. RC liable for shut downs for convenience 

d. Public utilities need not get local site plan and/or waivers

It's the wish list from the county so don't hesitate to dismiss some of it.

Weekly Update

KWA 

• Public groundbreaking ceremony for the process of converting Flint River water into drinking water once the City 
of Flint no longer receives water from Detroit during the transition toward the newly established Karegnondi 
Water Authority. 

• Water will be cut off from Detroit on April 18th 

• The conversion process for preparing the local water treatment facilities is expected to be completed by April 7th, 
however vendors have yet to be selected as of Wednesday of this week. 

• Bids were due in from vendors by Thursday of this week, putting a strain on the willingness of qualified vendors to 
participate. The expedited timeframe is less than ideal and could lead to some big potential disasters down the 
road.

Practices ("BMP") 


ADEQUACY OF 
EXISTING REVENUES 



Factors Impacting Utility Revenues 


Marked decrease in billed water and wastewater usage 

- Approximately 12% below FY 2014 Budget 

- Under investigation under separate contract, 

- A normal pattern of declining per customer water usage 
Increases in utility revenue requirements 

- O&M 

- Cash-Funded Capital Improvements 

- Improving Financial Management Practices (e.g. increased cash 
reserves)

WATER AND 
WASTEWATER 
FINANCIAL PLANS 



Financial Planning Overview 


Purpose: determine rate revenue required for financial 
sustainability 

Process 

- Forecast customer units of service and revenue at existing rates 

- Forecast operation and maintenance expenditures ("O&M") 

- Forecast capital expenditures 
» CIP 

» Existing and Proposed DS 

- Develop detailed cash flow forecasts 


Factors Driving Financial Plans 


Inflationary O&M Increases 
Annual Utility Recapitalization 

Water Utility Capital Improvements Associated with the 
Transition to KWA 

Financial Policies 


Inflationary O&M Increases 


• Largely associated with personnel costs 

- Annual COLA adjustments to Salaries and Medical 

- Legacy costs 

» Pension and Retiree Healthcare 

» Generally increase with salaries, usually higher based on pension funding 
levels 

• Also related to the cost of materials and supplies 

- Cost of Chemicals for Water and Wastewater Treatment 

- Utilities Costs (Primarily Electric) 

• Increases in cost of services provided via the General Fund (i.e. 
overhead cost allocation) 



R A F T E L I S 


10 


City of Flint 


Recapitalization 


Necessary at some level on an annual basis 

Level and frequency based on age of water and wastewater 
system and original construction materials 

Can reduce O&M costs (i.e. less sewer back-ups, water main 
breaks etc.) 

Avoids "mining assets" 


Transition to KWA 


• Assumed April 1 transition to KWA. 

• Revenues: 

- Decrease in revenues associated with cessation of service to Genesee 
County. 

• Expenditures: 

- Decrease in O&M associated with elimination of DWSD water purchases 

- Increases in expenditures associated with full-time Flint WTP Operation 
» O&M: Increased costs to operate and maintain WTP 

» Capital: Expenditures to upgrade WTP to operate full-time 

- Debt Service: Flint's share of KWA project debt service 



R AF T ELI S 


12 


City of Flint 


Financial Policies 



• Separate Financial Plans for Each Utility 

- Equity for Customers 

- Ensures one fund is not subsidizing another 

• Operating Reserve 

- Target of 90 days O&M and Debt Service 

- Working up to target over 5 years to mitigate rate impact 

• Cash Funded Capital Improvements 

- All cash funded due to financing constraints 

- Potential to use Michigan SRF in the future 

- Short term rate impact, but long-term savings over debt 

• Existing Debt Service Coverage 

- Substantial for water utility due to cash funding 

- No outstanding wastewater debt

Cost of Service Study Overview 



• Purpose: 

- Allocate costs to customer classes based on the demands they impose 
on the water and wastewater utility systems 

- Demand 

» Water: Average and Peak (Max Day, Max Hour) usage, and Customer 
Costs 

» Wastewater: Volume, Strength (BOD and TSS) and Customer Costs 

• Process 

- Determine revenue requirement 

- Allocate revenue requirement to cost components 

- Determine units of service by customer class 

- Determine unit cost of service 

- Allocate costs to customer classes

Rate Design Issues 



- Fixed vs. Volumetric Charges 

» Fixed ($.34 per dollar of rate revenue) 

> Typically recovers meter reading billing and collection and CS 

> Generate $.34 of every $1 of rate revenue 

> (+) Revenue Stability, (-) Larger Impact on lower volume users 

» Volumetric ($.66 per dollar of rate revenue) 

> Recovers average and peak demand costs for water, strength and volume for wastewater 

> (+) Potentially more equitable, (-) More variable revenue stream 

- Maintaining Existing Rate Structure 

» Structure changes create winners and losers 

» Potential demand response (losers may use less, but winners will not use more) 

» Navigate the KWA transition and revenue collection issues, address structure 
changes in the future

IMPACT OF 
TRANSITION TO KWA 



KWA Project Overview 


City previously a wholesale customer of DWSD 

Contract with DWSD will cease April 17 

City staff believe cost savings over continuing with DWSD 
could be achieved via KWA 

KWA project will draw raw water from Lake Huron, but will not 
be operational by April 17 

City will draw and treat water from the Flint River in the 
interim 

KWA members pay a portion of project costs based on 
contract capacity 


Analysis Overview 


• RFC worked with City staff to develop separate financial planning 
scenarios 

- Continuing with DWSD 

- Transition to KWA 

• Assumptions and Data 

- April 1 transition 

- 5% DWSD rate increases into the future 

- Similar financial planning policies in each scenario 

» Policies and strategy discussed in prior section applied to DWSD scenario 

- O&M Budget incorporating transition provided by City Staff 

- Project costs and phasing provided by City staff 

- Estimated Flint share of KWA debt service provided by City staff

The next TTHM sampling was conducted 2/17/15, testing will be 
done by the MDEQ. Our most recent internal tests show water 
to be within federal/state guidelines. Expect to receive a 
violation notice from MDEQ, due to the running average 
calculation, in 7-10 days. The notice to customers will go out by 
mid-March. 

Announcements made for grant awards to Flint for Leak 
Detection and Sewage sludge Load Out Facility. 

Discussing possible restructuring of loans. 

Veolia will provide preliminary recommendations at the 2/18/15 
Public Works Committee meeting - including process 
improvements, distributions system actions, communications 
improvements, and personnel support by way of new policies 
and procedures, training and new testing models. Priority 
budget, and timeline to follow within 1-2 weeks; much 
improvement has occurred as demonstrated by the most recent 
testing. 

A Water Advisory Committee and a Technical Advisory 
Committee have been formed as part of the process of

Everybody Is Checking the Safety of Water 


BgJ O 


City, state, news media, universities and 
other groups 

Safe = compliance with state and federal 

standards and required testing 

o Latest tests show water is in compliance with 
drinking water standards 

o Monthly report available on web page 

More than 20,000 tests required annually 
for city 

Strict testing requirements in place (what 
and how to test) 


Committee 



oTTHM is formed as a result of the reaction between chlorine 
and organic material in the water 

o City is required to test quarterly at 8 sites 

o Last summer, several sites had more TTHM than allowed 

oCity has reduced levels of TTHM and now all sites are in 
compliance 

o Customer notification letters are required until tests are in 
compliance an average of four quarters 

o It will take at least 2 more quarters to lower average 

o Even a change to DWSD water doesn’t solve problem 

o Flint is not alone - hundreds of communities are facing 
TTHM issues 


© February 18, 2015 Flint Public Works Committee 




Why Discolored Water? 


o Old cast iron pipes 

o Always has been some 
discolored water problems ■ 
mostly after water breaks 

o Efforts to reducing TTHM 
didn’t help discoloration 

o Doesn’t mean the water is 
unsafe but it is not appealing 
and raises questions 

o City will test the water at 
your home - call 787-6537 
or email 

flintwater@cityofflint.com 

o Tracking customer 
complaints is important

Q February 18, 2015 Flint Public Works Committee 


18 



REMEMBER 

We just started. Might not have an answer yet to your question 


o When will water improve - The water has improved with 
current actions. More changes will occur over weeks and 
months because of safety reviews 

o Date of next update and final report - An update will be 
provided next week and a report the following week. 

o Time frame for implementing recommendations - The 

City is already started. Others a few days and some weeks 
or months due to State approval being required or weather. 

o Cost of changes - Don’t know yet but we are aware of the 
financial concerns 


© February 18, 2016 Flint Public Works Committee 




o How are TTHM formed - It’s the reaction of chlorine to 
organics (leafs, dirt) in the water. 

o How to reduce TTHM - Reduce organics before introducing 
chlorine and shorten time chlorine has to react with the 
organics 

o What causes discoloration - Older lines, the iron parts of 
the system will leach iron into the water causing the 
discoloration. Other times its just air built up. 

o Why no discoloration with DWSD - There was. Flint had 
a bad time with breaks of old line and is doing lots of 
construction. This stirred up the water and caused 
discoloration. 


© 




o Can you test my water - The city will test your water for 
free. But, only 2 of 20 people have taken the city up on the 
offer since it began offering the service. 

o Medical problems - Some people may be sensitive to any 
water. Talk to your doctor. The City is communicating with the 
medical community. 

o Confidence that future problems will be avoided - 

Recommendations will include putting programs in place to 
better respond to water changes and assure quality

City of Flint 


Flint, Michigan - March 4, 2015 - Members of the newly established Flint Water Technical 
Advisory Committee met for two hours today at Flint City Hall to learn more about the steps the 
city is taking to confirm water safety and improve quality. Members include representatives from 
the Michigan State University, Genesee County Health Department, Kettering University, Mott 
Community College, and the Genesee County Medical Society. Joining them were experts from 
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA, along with several local 
elected officials. 

The presentation included confirmation of the safety of Flint’s water system and an overview of 
the opportunities available to improve water quality. Recent water testing results were shared 
that confirmed the city today is in compliance with all state guidelines. 

Committee members were reminded that another notification to residents would be required later 
this month, despite the city’s progress in improving and stabilizing water safety. The DEQ- 
required communication is related to test results from 2014. Committee members urged city 
officials to ensure the required communication focused on the progress and improvement 
made. Public health officials also offered to help communicate with health providers throughout 
the city in an effort to educate residents 

about the water’s safety. 

The Water Technical Advisory Committee is expected to meet on a monthly basis through the 
implementation of KWA as the city’s primary water source.

My boss is trying to find out, “what was done and dollars spent at the Flint office of Urban and Metropolitan 
Initiatives.” We were sent an agenda for FY 2013-14 (attached), but it does not contain much financial 
information or details of actual activity completed in Flint. 

Do you have or can you get information that will answer my boss’ questions?

Hi there Harvey - 

Just following up on this per brief conversation/mention at yesterday's senior staff meeting and Dave's voice mail to you 
as well. 

I believe you had indicated you had a meeting on this tomorrow, yes? 

We need to touch base and get all facts on this situation ASAP. Turning into unfortunate and unnecessary PR issue that 
we're trying to work with Treasury and DEQto be on top of, stem, find resolution, etc. 

Please call our office today to connect with Dave (as our lead on this) or myself or Jarrod if he's not available for some 
reason. 

Thanks much,

Thank you very much. I believe 1MCF equals 7480 gallons of water. If that is true then 10 units = 1 MCF.

Consumption charge based on 7 units of water @$13.09 per unit 
1 unit = 748 gallons of water 

There may be a way to convert a unit into an MCF, but I do not know it.

Ms. Murphy, 

Thank you. The calculations in the table was provided by treasury and I was seeking clarification, 
expert, but I learned that typically, most: rates have two components. 


am not a water 





This charge is based on the size of the water meter at the home or business. Most residential customers will 
have a meter between 5/8 Lh 's of an inch and 1 inch, 

2. Consumption Charge 

This charge is based on the amount of water used. The rate for usage is determined by the distance and 
elevation of the home or business from the water source. 

MCF is used in many place for calculating rates; however, since Flint is currently not using this calculation, what are the 
cost components that make up the $149 avg. monthly charge to the resident?

Harvey

Mr. Hollins, 

Jerry Ambrose asked me to respond to your request for more information on the Flint water cost analysis chart which 
you sent him yesterday. Please see the attached chart; it contains an added analysis by Jerry. The sections for which you 
asked for data can not be provided as we don't calculate prices in the manner you are comparing. 



Jerry's chart clearly represents what Flint has been talking about - a major increase in water rates would be necessary to 
pay the additional charge to purchase DWSD water.

If 1 MCF = 100 ccf, then Flint rate payers are currently paying an equivalent of $187per MCF . I don't 
think that is true.

I look forward to what you find. In addition, could you translate to $13.09/ 7 units into price/MCF when 
you get the right conversion?

with the workload, I am told she did not supervise, conclude on testing, or anything of that nature hut they needed help

Subject: Contact with FEMA Region V and Army Corp of Engineers 

This morning I had a conference call with FEMA Region V Administrator. He has briefed the FEMA Director on the Flint 
water issue as I have been in contact with FEMA Region V since this started (he and I were in Miami at the time for a 
meeting and discussed this). 

FEMA Region V and I are on the same page reference the Stafford Act and with the information I have relayed to the 
Mayor, City Manager, County Commissioner and others. 

I also contacted the Army Corp of Engineers to see what programs they may have in the form of direct assistance. We 
are looking into any programs that may allow fixes to infrastructure in case funding does become available from another 
source. We may be able to use other funding to match any federal funds/assistance the Corp could provide ... still a big 
unknown though, but I wanted to stay ahead of this. Just wanted to make you aware.

Harvey, 

I received your correspondence, and in reviewing it, my concern is that we only have me, yourself, MSP Capt. Chris 
Kelenske In deciding this important decision about the water problems here in the city of Flint. I would like to have more 
professional input, such as the Task Force that has been put in place. 

In looking at the written plan of action, it seems to be a positive step in the right direction. I also want to make sure the 
transparency of whatever we do is included. 

How soon do you need a definite answer to the proposed plan?

MEMORANDUM 


To: Michael Nystrom, Michigan infrastructure & Transportation Association 

From: Julie Metty Bennett and Mark Coscarelli, Public Sector Consultants 

Date: October 27, 2015 

Subject: Evaluating Michigan’s Underground Infrastructure Investment Needs Proposa 


BACKGROUND AND GOALS 

The recent drinking water crisis in Flint has brought attention to a challenge faced by com- 
munities throughout Michigan. Drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems 
throughout the state are aging and face decades of deferred maintenance. In many respects, 
these systems operate out of sight and out of mind, only gamering the public’s attention in 
times of crisis. 

Many of these systems were installed between 50 and 1 00 years ago and are approaching, 
or have exceeded, their planned lifespan. Given current municipal and state funding con- 
straints, investments are frequently made using a reactionary crisis management approach, 
which results in inefficient allocation of resources and does not provide a long-term solu- 
tion to infrastructure management. 

A proactive statewide plan is necessary to develop a funding approach to replace aging and 
obsolete underground infrastructure to ensure that Michigan's residents have reliable ac- 
cess to safe drinking water, wastewater is appropriately treated, and stormwater is 
adequately managed. 

SCOPE OF WORK 

The Michigan Infrastructure & Transportation Association (MIT A) has asked Public Sec- 
tor Consultants (PSC) to conduct a two-phase project that summarizes the current state of 
drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure in Michigan, as well as the cur- 
rent funding available and the investment needed to properly fund these systems. The first 
phase of the project will include the development of a white paper outlining current funding 
to support these systems (both available and actual investment), how that funding has 
changed over time, and potential gaps. The second phase of the project will include a more 
detailed analysis of the cost of clean water in Michigan. 

Phase I: White Paper Development 

In the first phase of the project, PSC will develop a white paper (five to seven pages) as- 
sessing the current state of drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure in 
Michigan and the current funding available to maintain and enhance these systems.

Letter of Agreement 


I have read the attached proposal for Evaluating Michigan’s Underground Infrastructure Investment 
Needs, submitted by Public Sector Consultants Inc. on October 27, 2015 1 agree that the Michigan

The project will begin on receipt of this signed agreement. This price shall remain in effect for 60 
days. 

This agreement may be amended only by written permission from both parties and becomes 
effective upon their authorized signatures. 

The Michigan Infrastructure & Transportation Association owns the final product and 
supportive work, but the Michigan Infrastructure & Transportation Association may not 
release to the public excerpted or modified portions of the final product without the approval of 
PSC. When PSC assures interviewees of confidentiality and/or anonymity, PSC will not attribute

Services and/or products not included in this agreement shall be provided by Public Sector

materials basis at rates mutually agreed on.

Hi Jean, 

This is odd, but for some reason the January 7, 9:00 meeting with John Walsh and Angela Ayers 
says the location is City of Flint on my end. Maybe it doesn’t show that on your end of the calendar? 
Since Dan has left, do you want to have this meeting with Keith? I don’t have full access to Keith’s 
calendar yet but I can check to see if this will work for him. 

Please advise. Thanks. Happy New Year.

Hey There, 


MDHHS requested on September 18 th the Governor to issue a proclamation for Lead Poisoning Awareness Prevention 
and Prevention Week (October 25 - October 31). Given recent events 1 am not sure this is something we want to be 
issuing. 





We did issue this proclamation in 2012 and 2014. 


I am going to decline the proclamation unless you think this is something we should be doing.

Hi Laura, 


Received an email this morning from Janice Berry at MDHHS checking in on a proclamation they requested on Sept. 18 lh 
for Lead Poisoning Awareness and Prevention month. It was sent to the tributes email but it doesn't look like any follow 
up happened with it. We do have a copy of a proc we did for this last year. I could put it together quickly, but am not 
sure with recent events what your take on this is. 


Thanks!

Morgan- here are tomorrow's media briefings. Jarrod reached out to Beth re: moving the entire timing up 5 minutes. 
Let me know if that's an issue (It was because WWJ couldn't go live at 7:35 because it put them too close to a break and

April 28, 2015 



Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
1 1 1 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, Ml 48909 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 2011. Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and 1 feel that the 
financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel It is appropriate to relinquish my position as 
Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, 1 was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of FA 
436 of 2012. 1 am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint; ray predecessors were Michael K. Brown (PA 4 
and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major steps 
toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and financial best 
practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and levels of service 
provision, and preparing die City for long term stability. 


Addressing the Financial Emergency; 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, characterized 
by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash How, and unsustainable legacy 
costs. At the conclusion ofFYl 2, the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager was appointed, the City’s 
General Fund deficit stood a? $19.1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8. 8 million; and cash flow was 
$13 million, or less than one month’s expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these Issues and putting Flint hack onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street lighting; 
waste collection was changed to a fee for sendee from a millage rate; and increases in utility rates to among 
the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public

safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrunk by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General Fund 
deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan Board. 
City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have been 
enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the requirement 
for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and maintenance of a 
biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund balance reserve, 
including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a requirement to begin 
funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over daily 
activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City operations have 
been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no longer being done 
internally, 91 1 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 2015, and the City- 
funded 68 th District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 67 11 ' District Court in 
January, 201 6. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the Karegondi Water Authority 
instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective bargaining contracts have also 
been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the stage for permanent reductions 
in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the level of parks maintenance. 
Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, with reduced assistance from 
the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new Master 
Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has been 
completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new zoning 
ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces significantly 
engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the Flint City 
Council, with the support of the Mayor. 



Governor Snyder

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current Charter 
and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which will be 
elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current Strong Mayor 
form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 

Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work on 
the part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit over 
its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is currently 
operating under a judge’s order which allows modification of the City’s historical level of health 
care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 

• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a long 
term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently provides is 
not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint’s total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This millage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago, are 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety services, even with the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This was recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 1 00 more officers on the street than Flint does. 



Governor Snyder 
April 28, 2015

• Equally important to providing State support in the form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City's lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually -- without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City's 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 

Emergency Ma&ageCs Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of P,A. 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act. provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer, Based on the examples presented above, 1 am prepared to sav that I 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint: has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 21(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved, 1 recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. 1 believe it is critical that: the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City' as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint: and complete transition back to full local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist: City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force In leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play, 1 applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 

If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to the 
historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of City 
leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

1 have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 


Sincerely, 



Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

Frequently Asked Questions: 
Water Lead Levels in the City of Flint 
September 2015 


How can lead get into drinking water? 

Lead detections in Flint drinking water exist at the home level. Sampling at the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant has shown no lead in its treated water. However, this 
contaminant leaches into water from a home’s lead service lines, lead solder, and 
leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. 

Does the city meet federal drinking water standards for lead and copper? 

Yes, the city is meeting state and federal guidelines for lead and copper. 

The City of Flint has regularly monitored for lead and copper since federal law began 
requiring it in 1991. 

When the City changed water sources in May 2014, state and federal law required the 
city to sample for lead and copper for a full year to determine how the water may be 
interacting with residential lead plumbing to increase lead levels. While the city’s results 
show residential lead levels below the federal threshold for immediate response 
activities, Flint is moving quickly to optimize corrosion control measures in its water 
system. 

Some individual homes showed high numbers for lead. Isn’t that a concern? 

For the homeowner, yes it is. There is no “safe” level for lead, and while the leading 
cause of lead poisoning around the country is lead paint, any source of lead ingestion is 
worthy of concern. 

But the State and federal guidelines for lead and copper acknowledge an important 
reality: Any home that has a lead service connection or lead plumbing will impart some 
varying amount of lead into the home’s water. The only way to eliminate lead in a home 
water system is to remove lead plumbing or replace lead service connections to the city 
system. 

The lead and copper rule requires the local operator to sample dozens, sometimes 
hundreds of homes in the service area to get a general sense of how the water supply is 
interacting with lead plumbing and service connections. The tests are done specifically 
at homes with lead service connections. Individual results vary and all participants are 


1 


Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure? 

The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout 
Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint. 

Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint 
changed its water source (May 2014 - April 2015) showed no significant change in the 
pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data 
suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an 
increase in lead exposure throughout the community. 

How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem? 

Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90 th percentile calculation. If more 
than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a 
violation, it triggers other requirements which could include public notification, additional 
water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment. 

While some of Flint’s individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action 
level, compliance is based on the 90 th percentile of samples. The City of Flint’s 90 th 
percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 201 1 , and 15 parts 
per billion in 1992, but never exceeded the action level. 

The two most recent sampling periods, in 2014 and 2015, were 6 parts per billion and 
1 1 parts per billion, respectively. 

Did the city use every sample they got back? 

Sampling requirements for lead and copper are designed to target the most common 
pathways to lead ingestion in homes with the least protection. The sample must be 
collected from a commonly used kitchen or bathroom tap, and in accordance with the 
provided sampling instructions. Homes that employ filtration or additional treatment 
cannot be included. Samples must also be collected within the established monitoring 
period. 

1 have a lead service connection or lead plumbing. What should I do? 

Replacement is the only way to eliminate lead exposure. However, here are some 
interim steps homeowners can take to reduce it: 

Flush pipes before drinking, and only use cold water for consumption. 

The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may 
contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer, 
"flush" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This 
could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home, 
such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer. 

Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making 
baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels of lead.

Who is responsible for replacement of leaded materials? 

Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials 
within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility The City of Flint owns the service 
pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility 
This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house 
is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner. 

Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines? 

Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make 
the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated 
effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels. 

What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment? 

The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal 
corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years. 

However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized 
Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months. 

What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year? 

The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior 
to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by 
KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and 
copper sampling every six months. Additionally, the city’s water treatment plant will 
continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment. 

How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint? 

The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these 
connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it 
would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work. 

What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house? 

Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to 
$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as 
well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered. 

With more than 15,000 lead service lines at an estimated average cost of $4,000 for 
each replacement, total cost could be $60 million or more.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 


• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

® MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

® All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

« MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

® Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

® Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 



• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 


WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 
source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

® Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

• WIC cannot cover bottled water.

Flint Water FAQ & Talking Points 26 - 30

Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure? 

The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout 
Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint. 

Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint 
changed its water source (May 2014 - April 2015) showed no significant change in the 
pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data

than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per

Summary: Conference Call with City of Flint 
September 15, 2015 


Participating: Tom Saxton, Wayne Workman, Fred Fleaden, Eric Cline, Mayor Walling, City 
Administrator Natasha Henderson, Finance Director Jody Lundquist, City Attorney Pete Bade, Assistant 
City Attorney Tony Chubb 


• The City of Flint is involved in two lawsuits regarding water and sewer rates: Kincaid and Shears. 

o It was stressed that the Shears and Kincaid lawsuits are both separate but are being litigated 
concurrently and that any developments mutually impact both suits. 

® It was noted that in the opinion of the City, both cases will continue to be litigated for some time due 
to the complexity of the issues involved. 

• In a related matter, the City Attorney noted that the Water Coalition lawsuit to force the City to 
purchase water from the City of Detroit was dismissed in Genesee County Circuit Court. 

Shears Lawsuit 

• Shears was decided by the Genesee County Circuit Court by a non-final order on August 17, 2015. 

o Among other things, the Court enjoined City officials from any longer imposing a 35 percent 
increase in water and sewer rates; from disconnecting water or sewer service due to 
delinquent bills, dating back to September 16, 201 1; and from placing liens on property due 
to delinquent bills, dating back to September 16, 201 1. 

o City officials have filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals seeking, among other 
things, a stay of the Genesee County Circuit Court injunction. 

o In the interim. City officials are complying with the Court’s order in Shears. 

® The City’s appeal is still being considered by the Court. No timeline for a decision is known. 

Kincaid Lawsuit 

• Kincaid was decided by the Michigan Court of Appeals on June 1 1, 2015. 

o The Court held that a 35 percent increase in water and sewer rates imposed by City officials 
on September 16, 20 1 1, violated the City charter and that Emergency Manager Mike Brown 
had no statutory authority to later ratify those rate increases in May of 2012. 

o The Court of Appeals remanded the case to Genesee County Circuit Court. 

o City officials intended to appeal this decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, but missed the 
filing deadline by one day . 

® The City Attorney stated that litigation of this case must continue because some key issues have yet 
to be resolved, including: 

o The exact damages have not been clarified. 

o The issue of who has standing in this case remains unresolved. 



Summary: Conference Call with City of Flint 
September 15, 2015 


Financial Impacts 

• City officials estimate that nullification of the 35 percent increase in water and sewer rates is costing 
approximately $600K/month. Therefore, if the Court orders either refunds or credits against future 
water and sewer bills retroactive to September 16, 201 1, the cost is estimated to be approximately 
$30M. 

o The Finance Director noted that since September 2011, the system has had a declining 
number of users, so the total potential refund is higher than basing calculations from the 
current number of users. 

o The City Administrator stated that the City has not developed a plan to issue a refund of this 
size because the City lacks sufficient funds to do so and they would be unable to operate at 
this point. 

• The City Administrator noted that citizens are paying the latest monthly billing but that the City 
must contend with lower revenues for the foreseeable future. 

• In addition, it was noted that if the City has to refund the Ready-to-Serve charge from September 
2011 through July 1, 2015, that this amount is approximately $10M. 

® It was noted that the amount of delinquent funds owed to the City that are over 30 days old has 
grown from $7.8M to $8.4M since the ruling in the Shears Lawsuit. 

o Further, the City Administrator stated that because the City is prohibited from shutting off 
service for non-payment, the amount of delinquent funds is expected to continue to grow. 

® In addition, the City Administrator noted that the measures taken to reserve funds within the system 
to address the financial issues has delayed needed capital improvements, which further exacerbates 
the problems within the system, but the City cannot address these capital needs without additional 
revenue. 

® The City Administrator further stressed the importance of the State assistance sought by the Mayor 
in his September 14, 2015, letter to the Governor. 

o The Mayor requested $30M for infrastructure and capital improvements related to the City’s 
water and sewer system. 

o It was stressed by Treasury that existing funding options were very limited and we were not 
aware of anything short of a legislative appropriation. 

* State funding of the City’s $30M request will likely invite requests from many other 
communities with similar needs. 

" The State recently awarded the City $2M in Distressed Cities grant funds to 
implement improvements to their system. 

* The State further provided the City with an additional $2M in relief for outstanding 
SRF/DWRF loans. 

■ Treasury is not aware of any current Flint projects related to their water quality issues 
that could be funded through the DWRF program and DEQ is responsible for 
managing DWRF eligible projects.

Mr. Benjamin H. Grumbles, Acting Assistant Administrator 
United States Environmental Protection Agency 
Washington, DC 20460 


Dear Mr. Grumbles: 

SUBJECT: State Programs to Control Lead in School Drinking Water 

Thank you for your letter of March 18, 2004, requesting information on efforts being 
taken by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to control lead in 
drinking water at schools and day care facilities. The following information has been 
assembled by staff in our Water Division (WD) having the regulatory responsibility for 
public water systems. 

The WD continues to actively implement the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule 
(LCR) authorized by the 1986 amendments to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 

1976 PA 399, as amended. In Michigan, we have approximately 900 schools and day 
care centers that meet the definition of a nontransient noncommunity (NTNC) public 
water system. AH of these systems rely on groundwater as their source. Fortunately, 
groundwater in Michigan is not typically corrosive or conducive to significant lead 
leaching from water system components. 

As specified by the LCR, routine monitoring for lead and copper has been and 
continues to be conducted in these NTNC systems. Our experience has shown lead 
levels to be acceptable in these schools and day care centers when samples have been 
correctly collected from actual drinking water taps. From 1999 to 2003, the MDEQ 
laboratory analyzed 14,207 lead samples from NTNC public water systems. Only 
2.4 percent of these sample results exceeded the lead action level of 15 parts per billion 
(ppb). Over 94 percent of these results reported lead levels less than or equal to half 
the lead action level of 7,5 ppb, with 37 percent reporting lead as not detected. On the 
rare occasion that one of these NTNC systems exceeded the lead action level, the 
owners have typically eliminated exposure by supplying bottled water or removing the 
offending tap until a long-term solution has been instituted, Rarely have the elevated 
lead levels been attributed to a system-wide problem. In Michigan, it has been 
repeatedly demonstrated that elevated lead levels from drinking water taps in schools 
are diminished by fixture replacement. In the last 5 years, we have had only 10 action 
level exceedences reported from a total of 1,750 NTNC public water systems. Only 
two of these systems have had to install corrosion control treatment.

In your letter, you state that schools are only subject to the requirements of the LCR if 
they have their own water system. This statement implies there is no benefit to those 
schools served by community public water systems. The WD feels strongly that the 
LCR does provide a significant benefit to schools and day care centers that are served 
by community public water systems (CPWS). Despite limitations in these regulations 
that severely restrict CPWS from using schools and day care centers as sampling sites, 
proper implementation of this regulation should result in reduced lead exposure for all 
customers. For instance, schools and day care centers connected to CPWS serving 
more than 50,000 residents benefited from the LCR because these water systems have 
had to demonstrate and maintain optimal corrosion control. These large systems were 
required to reduce lead levels throughout their water system to the lowest levels 
possible. In addition, schools and day care centers connected to CPWS serving 
50,000 or fewer residents have benefited from proper implementation of the LCR 
because these water systems have had to achieve and maintain compliance with the 
lead action level. Furthermore, any CPWS that exceeded a lead action level also had to 
provide public notification and public service announcements in accordance with and on 
a frequency specified by the LCR. Therefore, schools and day care centers in these 
systems could choose to provide an alternate drinking water source until compliance 
was achieved and lead levels were reduced in their CPWS. 

Your letter also references the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA) of 1988, which 
recalled drinking water coolers with lead-lined water reservoir tanks and banned new 
drinking water coolers with lead parts. This law caused Michigan’s state plumbing 
board to make changes in the construction code to ban lead materials in other drinking 
water system components as weil. Items such as 50/50 lead-tin solder for household 
plumbing, lead packers and lead wool used for well screens, and brass fixtures having 
greater than 8 percent lead were among the items banned from future use in potable 
water systems. 

In 1988, prior to the LCCA, NTNC schools in Michigan were informed of the requirement 
to provide public notice regarding the potential for lead in drinking water, and they were 
mailed an example notice to use. All Michigan schools supplied by CPWS were also 
mailed the same information with a recommendation that they provide similar public 
notice although it was not required by law. 

In 1989, over 8,000 Michigan schools and day care centers were mailed information on 
the LCCA. We cited concerns about lead levels and recommended a sampling and 
flushing protocol be instituted at ail taps used for consumption, not just the water 
coolers required by the LCCA. In addition, staff of the WD made presentations to state 
school business officials and to the environmental health association representing local 
health departments. Articles were also published in school and day care association 
newsletters. 



Mr. Benjamin H. Grumbles 
Page 3 
April 21, 2004 


in 1989, we also conducted a random telephone survey of 40 schools and 40 day care 
centers (both NTNC and those connected to another water system) regarding the 
LCCA, Seventy-five percent of the schools were aware of the LCCA requirements and 
50 percent had performed some monitoring, while 40 percent of the day care centers 
were aware of the LCCA requirements, and about 20 percent had sampled. 

In 1990, a second mailing to all 8,000 schools and day care centers was conducted, 
with updated information on the recall of water coolers as required by the LCCA and 
with the recommendations developed in Michigan on flushing drinking water outlets. In 
this letter, we also asked that any sample results be reported to us even though they 
were specifically not required to do so by the LCCA, About 30 of 500 school districts 
reported results from 720 “first draw" samples taken in over 200 buildings; 2.5 percent 
of these results exceeded the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 50 ppb in effect at 
that time for lead, 8.6 percent exceeded 20 ppb, and 17.5 percent exceeded 10 ppb. It 
should be noted that all (104) flushed sample results reported lead levels less than 
10 ppb. We also noted that the overall average levels in first draw samples collected 
from kitchen faucets were higher than levels from the targeted lead lined water coolers 
that were the focus of the LCCA. As a result of this data, state staff did pilot testing in 
three school districts and provided technical assistance to schools and day care 
centers. Follow-up sampling and investigations were also accomplished by state staff in 
other school districts. 

As you mentioned, the LCCA also established a technical assistance program to 
support state activities to reduce lead contamination in schools. The WD is aware of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) technical assistance fact 
sheets, technical bulletins training seminars, and the publication, “Lead in School 
Drinking Water.” As discussed, we conducted several mailings, made numerous 
presentations, conducted follow-up surveys, responded to requests for assistance, 
participated in several pilot tests to reduce lead levels, compiled data, conducted 
additional sampling, and responded to many telephone inquiries with appropriate 
technical assistance. All of these activities constitute our technical assistance program. 
However, no funding has ever been allocated to states for implementation of the LCCA. 
All of the activities performed by Michigan in response to the requirements of the LCCA 
were done so with resources diverted from other programs. The primary requirement of 
the LCCA was for schools that identified coolers on a list of those suspected to contain 
lead lining to repair, replace, remove, or sample to show that these coolers did not 
contribute to lead in the drinking water. If the schools did sample, they were also 
required to tell their customers that results were available, if schools had no coolers on 
the list, nothing further was required by the LCCA. Despite this limited application of the 
LCCA, Michigan has performed numerous activities beyond the scope specified in the 
LCCA without any federal funding. 



Mr, Benjamin H. Grumbles

Finally, you ask what the USEPA can do to further efforts in this voluntary program. We 
have several suggestions. First, we recommend that the USEPA consider allowing 
schools to be considered Tier 1 sampling sites in CPWS so that we can gain more 
information on possible lead exposure in schools. Allowing CPWS to use schools will 
afford them an opportunity to use sampling sites that are more accessible than private 
homes, more likely to be geographically distributed throughout their system, and likely 
to satisfy a large constituency (parents). From our experience, we also recommend that 
the USEPA consider a sampling protocol for schools that would determine if the fixtures 
at kitchen taps are a problem that could be simply resolved by replacement. The 
USEPA may also want to consider requiring the owner of these facilities to replace any 
remaining lead service lines supplying schools or day care centers. 

In conclusion, we understand that the detection of elevated lead levels at customer taps 
in Washington, DC, has caused the USEPA to focus on this issue. However, the MDEQ 
wants to emphasize that despite the limitations in this law, proper implementation of the 
LCR accomplishes adequate reduction in lead levels. Failure to carry out some rule 
provisions in one case should not be cause for disparaging implementation across the 
country, or for unnecessary revamping of this regulation. If you need further information 
oi^ssistancej}lease contact Mr. James K. Cleland, Assistant Division Chief, WD, at 
IjW^SPjMor you may contact me.

Chemical testing could have predicted Flint's water crisis

Press) 


Chemical tests could have predicted the corrosion in the pipes that is now being blamed for endangering the 
health of thousands of vulnerable Flint residents by elevating lead levels in their water supply, experts say. 

As the city scrambles to reconnect to the Detroit water system, the absence of such testing on the Flint River 
water is one of many missed opportunities that might have lessened or avoided the crisis, they say. 

“Any competent person should have seen this water will eat up iron and eat up lead,” Marc Edwards, a Virginia 
Tech professor and national expert on pipe corrosion, told the Free Press. Edwards said his own research 
shows that Flint River water, without additional controls, corrodes the lead inside pipes at 1 9 times the rate of 
water piped from Detroit.

Among red flags that popped up over the last 18 months: 

• General Motors announced in October 201 4 that it was pulling its engine plant off Flint water after workers there began noticing rust spots on newly 
machined parts. The city approved letting GM switch to water from Flint Township, but didn't change its own water treatment procedures. 


• The University of Michigan-Flint alerted city officials that it found elevated lead levels in its water in January, prompting the school to shut off some 
some drinking fountains and add water filters to others. 


• Testing in the fall of 2014 found E. coli in the city's water system, prompting ''boil water" notices. The city's procedures for killing the E. coli produced 
chemical by-products known as trihalomethanes, which can cause cancer with long-term exposure. The city had to adopt additional measures to reduce 
them. 


“Common sense tells you that the Flint River is not your first choice of drinking water,” said Shawn McElmurry, who teaches civil and environmental 
engineering at Wayne State University and has followed Flint closely.

Q & A on Flint's water troubles

Experts say the testing could have been done before the switch from the Detroit system. But officials from the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality note that that kind of testing isn't required under federal drinking-water rules and has never been done in Michigan. What's more, they said, the 
Flint River water, treated in the city's plant, was already approved as a backup supply in case of interrupted service from Detroit. 


Other experts said the testing is more nuanced, part art and part science. Still, they acknowledge that by examining things such as the acidity of water 
and other factors, engineers could have estimated how much corrosion to expect once water from the Flint River was pumped into homes and 
businesses across the city. 


“Not every engineer in our field could do it, it's a pretty specialized area," said David Cornwell, a Virginia-based engineering consultant and a technical 
adviser to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council, a group of experts that works with the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water 
issues.

The fix now will cost $1 2 million — a combination of money from the state, the city and the Flint-based non-profit C.S. Mott Foundation, which has 
pledged $4 million to help pay Detroit for the water while Flint waits to connect to a new water authority in partnership with Genesee County. 

Water woes began shortly after switch from Detroit 

Flint began using Flint River water as its main supply in April 2014. Before that, it bought Lake Huron water that was treated and delivered by the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage Department. Detroit ended that deal one day after Flint voted to join Genesee County in forming the Karegnondi Water Authority, 
which plans to build its own Lake Huron intake and pipe the water to the Flint Water Plant. 

Flint officials wanted to remain on Detroit's system, but the two sides couldn't agree on a price and a contract length. 

Once the switch to river water was made, the city, which was operating under a state-appointed emergency financial manager, faced one problem after 
another. Residents packed city council meetings and held protest marches to voice their anger about water quality. 

Experts say Flint's lead problems could have been held in check if the city had added phosphates to the water, as Detroit has done for years. The 
treatment doesn't eliminate lead entirely, but it does form a film over the pipes themselves, effectively sealing in the lead and reducing the amount in the 
water to acceptable levels. 

But when Flint switched to river water, it didn't add phosphates. Instead it added lime to soften the water. 

“The lime softening process has the added benefit of some corrosion control,” said Liane Smith, chief of Michigan's Office of Drinking Water and 
Municipal Assistance. 

Smith said that once the switch was made, the state began testing for lead and copper, as is required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 

“Any new supply that comes along has to do two six-month rounds of monitoring for lead and copper out in their distribution system,” Smith said. If those 
tests show corrosion, additional steps, such as perhaps adding phosphates, are supposed to be followed. 

The first round of testing completed in December 201 4 showed lead levels of 6 parts per billion. The second round, completed in June of this year, 
showed they had almost doubled to 1 1 parts per billion. The EPA requires a remediation plan when levels reach 1 5 parts per billion and can demand 
action even beiow that mark on systems that serve more than 50,000 people. 

Cornwell said phosphates are considered more effective than lime softening and they don't raise treatment costs substantially. But they have side effects, 
he said. 

"The negative is that nobody really likes phosphates out in the environment,” he said, noting they can find their way into rivers and lakes, fueling algae 
blooms such as the ones in Lake Erie. 

“There is more to it than saying we're just going to pump phosphates,” Cornwell said. “You may have to make other adjustments.”

Flint River water a challenge to clean up 

Flint River water was always going to pose more treatment challenges than the cold, clear water that comes from the bottom of Lake Huron, experts said. 

The river has been marked by decades of industrial pollution. Its tributaries channel farmland run-off into it and its temperature varies by season. Warmer 
water can promote bacteria growth. All of those factors make treating it to drinking-water standards more difficult. 

"The city was doing the best it could” to clean up pollutants, Edwards said, but added that corrosivity was inevitable. 

He blamed the problems on a lack of expertise rather than intentional wrongdoing. 

“I think it started relatively innocently. They didn't understand testing and they didn't understand corrosivity,” he said. 

Last month, Edwards' research group released results of corrosion tests it conducted on Flint's water. For the test, researchers used copper pipe with 
lead solder, which is common in older homes. 

The tests showed Flint River water without added phosphates corroded the lead at 1 9 times the rate of Detroit water. Even when phosphates were 
added, it corroded at 1 6 times the rate of the Detroit water. 

“From the second it was switched, it was doomed from the lead problem," Edwards said. 

When residents began complaining about the water, the city and state should have begun to rethink their testing, Edwards said. 

Problems were evident soon after the switch. 

In August last year, E. coli was found in the water and residents were urged to boil it before drinking it. The city treated it with disinfectant, but that 
produced by-products in the water known as trihalomethanes. Long-term exposure to them can cause cancer, so the city began making treatment 
adjustments. 

Then as summer turned to fall, workers at Flint’s GM engine plant began seeing rust on newly machined engine parts. GM's lab tests found high levels of 
chloride in the water used to wash down metal shavings and cool parts heated from the rapid machining action inside the plant, GM spokesman Tom 
Wickham said. 

GM tried to treat the water in the plant. It had drinking water delivered and tankers brought water for operations, Wickham said. 

But it eventually sought to connect to Flint Township's water system, which is supplied by Detroit. 

In December the connection was finalized and Detroit water began flowing to the plant, via Flint Township.

In January 2015, lead was showing up at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus. School leaders become concerned about the water supply after the 
city issued "boil water" advisories to kill E. coli and realized they'd never done routine, thorough water testing. 

Tests in January and February showed elevated levels of lead and other problems in isolated areas — specifically in two infrequently used drinking 
fountains in two older buildings. 

Follow-up testing found other elevated levels of lead, and those sinks and fountains then were either fitted with filters or removed, said Mike Lane, 
director of the environment, health and safety department 

He said officials suspected the problem was in their pipes but notified the city anyway. 

In June, Miguel Del Toral of the Environmental Protection Agency drafted an internal memo noting the problems Flint had experienced with E. coli and 
the by-products of the chemicals used to treat it. 

"A major concern from a public health standpoint is lack of corrosion control treatment in the city of Flint for mitigating lead and copper levels in the 
drinking water," Del Toral wrote. 

The memo caused a stir when the American Civil Liberties Union exposed it. But the EPA told the Free Press on Friday that the memo was a draft that 
was never delivered to MDEQ officials, including Smith, whose names appear on it. 

The EPA did say it discussed the concerns raised in the memo with MDEQ officials in July, but the agency did not respond immediately to a request for 
details. 

Leaching lead not unique to Flint 

The problem of lead leaching into drinking water isn't unique to Flint. Across Michigan and around the country, pipes that carry water from the mains 
under the street into homes, businesses and schools often contain lead. Inside homes and business, many older plumbing fixtures and soldered pipes 
also contain it. 

Cornwell said officials from across the nation have formed a working group to review the lead and copper rules and look for ways to improve them. 
Among the things being considered is a national effort to remove lead pipes from water systems. 

But even if a national consensus formed around that idea, the process would take years, Cornwell said. A funding source for such a massive project also 
would be needed. 

Still, he said, removing the pipes is the only surefire way to eliminate lead from the system. 

"We can only do so much with water chemistry," he said. "We can only turn the knob so much."

Dear Ms. McCormick, 

In cooperation with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and city engineers, the City of 
Flint has undertaken a review of the regulatory requirements necessary to supply water to our residential and 
commercial customers. As part of our evaluation it was determined that the Flint Water Treatment Plant is 
capable of successfully "blending” or"co-mingling" water sources while continuing to provide quality drinking 
water to citizens. 

The Flint Water Treatment Plant would require approximately $1,3 million dollars in increased expenses in 
order to biend as much as one third (1/3) of treated river water with two thirds (2/3) of treated DWSD water. 
Using the 2013 DWSD rates this would result in savings of between two and three million dollars annually 
based on current usage data. The MDEQ has provided Flint with written documentation supporting our 
blending of water sources and the potential benefit 

Given this Information we respectftilly request written permission from DWSD to proceed with 
blending treated Flint River Water with treated DWSD water. 

It should be understood that our goal is to deliver both high quality and economically viable water to our 
customers. This goal has led us to fully consider all available options including purchasing water from the 
Karegnondi Water Authority and use of the Flint River, We believe that in order for an option with DWSD to be 
successful it Is essential that along with the proposed authorisation to blend water that there is a guaranteed 
containment of the new "fixed costs” that exist in the current fee structure. The new DWSD fixed charge of 
$707,000 each month regardless of amount of water used is five times the original $143,000 each month 
instituted only two years ago. This has resulted in the cost of water from DWSD dropping in recent years as the 
overall fee has increased annually by millions although our usage has continued to decline. The continuation of 
this trend would render our request and goals invalid. 

With the current Emergency Manager condition in Flint we believe that limiting an agreement to only three 
years is appropriate. This time frame would also serve as an evaluation period prior to any proposed long term 
agreement being considered. 

We appreciate your consideration and look forward to working together.

Mr. Edward Kurtz April 1 1 , 201 3 

Emergency Manager 
City of Flint 

1101 South Saginaw Street 
Flint, MI 48502 

Dear Mr. Kurtz: 

Thank you for your March 29, 2013 letter, which is attached for reference. As the Emergency 
Manager for the City of Flint (“Flint” or “City”), you have asked for my concurrence, pursuant to 
Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, to authorize a contract in 
excess of $50,000.00 not subject to competitive bidding. This request was related to the City 
entering into an agreement with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) for provision of raw 
water for the City. 

In considering your request, I took note of the following facts in support of Flint joining KWA. 
First, there is widespread support in the City for this move, including the support of the Mayor, 
the City Council, and the Emergency Manager. Second, this move will provide a unique 
opportunity for the City and County to partner on an important project, which will hopefully lead 
to future regional collaboration. Third, the Department of Environmental Quality is supportive of 
the City participating in the KWA project. Finally, your representations that this deal will lead to 
substantial savings for the City over the coming decades, savings that are desperately needed to 
help with the turnaround of the City of Flint. 

It is my understanding that the Detroit Water and Sewer Department is making a final best offer 
to Genesee County and the City of Flint next Monday, April 1 5, 2013. As such, this approval 
wall be effective at 5 pm on April 16, 2013 after receiving written notice from the City that either 
no such offer was presented to the county and the City or that an offer was received and was 
rejected in good faith based upon specified objections. 

For the reasons described above and subject to the conditions set forth herein, pursuant to 
Section 12 (3) of PA 436 of 2012. 1 am authorizing you to proceed with adopting the resolution 
and entering into a contract with KWA.

Andy Dion 
Stale Treasurer 
P, 0. Box 30716 
Lansing, Ml 48909 


Dear Treasurer Dillon: 

Flint, Genesee County and KWA received an eight page letter from Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department (DWSD) offering a framework for a long-term agreement with 
our region. Two scenarios were presented; 

Scenario 1 : Water from the Lake Huron Plant. 

This offer was dismissed immediately because Flint would still be responsible for their 
share of the KWA water pipeline delivery system estimated to be $79 million, in 
addition Flint would not be able to operate the Flint Water Plant in which we have 
invested over $40 million per MDEQ mandates over the past ten years. Finally, 
although DWSD shows this as an option and supplied a per month cost projection for 
the first year, no total costs over the life of the contract were provided. 

Scenario 2: “Full Service” Water Supply 

This offer was also rejected. DWSD would supply water to Flint/Genesee the same way 
they currently are today. They would change the method of calculating our bill. The 
offer would provide a $1.00 per ccf reduction on our usage for the first year, providing a 
30 year contract is signed. 

After review of the offer, Flint/Genesee has the following concerns:

110-766-7346 FAX' 8 1 0-766-72 1 § v,-ww.dty«ffiinLeom 


t 

5. DWSD's offer does not allow for the use of Flints existing water plant 

6, The offer indicates that the total cost to Flint over the life of the contract would be 
$587,990,865. No indication of what annual rate of increase was used in this 
projection. Flint can only assume it is 4.4% based on the Tucker Young report. It 
is also based on 40.8 mgds. KWA’s proposal is for $849,775,180 based on 
80rngds (33% more). Based on 60 mgds DWSD’s proposal would be 
$808,950,738.

Dear Ms. Brown: 

Regarding: Termination of Contract for the Provision of Water Sendees 

by the City of Detroit, Water and Sewerage Department 

On December 20, 1965, the City of Detroit, through its Board of Water Commissioners, 
(DWSD) and the City of Flint, Michigan (Flint) entered into a contract for the provision of 
DWSD treated water to Flint and the distribution by flint of that water to other Genesee County 
communities. Section 18 of that Agreement 1 provides: 


18. The Board [DWSD] shall supply and sell water to the City [Flint] from the water system of 
the City of Detroit, and the City shall receive and purchase such water in accordance with the 
terms of this Agreement for an indefinite period of time hut at least for a period of thirty-five 
(35) years from the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated by either party after 
expiration of said 35-year period, upon one year's written notice served upon the other party by 
delivering the same to the Secretary of the Board or to the Clerk of tire City as the case may be, 
or at any time upon mutual consent of both parties. 

Please take notice that pursuant to this section, 18, of the above-referenced Agreement, DWSD is 
terminating this Agreement one year from today’s date (April 1 7, 2014). 


Sincerely yours, 



Sue F. McCormick 
Director 


1 Although the Agreement between DWSD has been subsequently amended. Section 1 8 remains unchanged and in 
full effect.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


® The preliminary list of schools is completed, has been circulated to DHHS, and 
has been provided to DLARA to begin plumbing assessments. The list will 
remain active in case of additional schools requesting assessment/testing. 

® DLARA to coordinate with Flint Schools on access for plumbing assessments. 
Tap coding identification from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
guidance to be provided to DLARA. 

• Preliminary comments on sampling instructions were received by voice mail from 
EPA. Need to discuss directly. 

® DEQ comments provided to MDARD on information for restaurants, and a draft 
was forwarded to DHHS for their comments. 

• Approve Flint plan for water line - The city of Flint and Genesee County flushed 
the pipeline beginning October 1 3; the first set of samples for total coliform 
analysis was collected around 2:30 a.m. Genesee County planned to collect 
their second sample for bacteriological analysis between 6 and 8 p.m. last night. 

It may take additional time to flush the Dort Reservoir before it is ready to be 
sampled and may set back the time that the pipeline is ready to be placed into 
operation (October 15 is the soonest possible). The yard piping configuration at 
the Flint Water Treatment Plant does allow for flexibility in operation and ability to 
take Dort out of service and maintain supply from Detroit; however, we have not 
been able to confirm that this is the way Flint plans to proceed. 

• An e-mail was sent to DHHS regarding the lead education plan for schools for 
drinking water to determine if DEQ or DHHS will be the lead and to determine 
how this effort will be coordinated with broader lead education/outreach efforts. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted regarding scheduling regular meetings with 
DEQ, and the initial meeting is tentatively scheduled for Friday, October 16. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted to schedule a tour of the Flint Water 
Treatment Plant. It is tentatively scheduled to occur in conjunction with the initial 
meeting. Logistics may require postponement until the week of October 19. 

• DHHS has been contacted, and they have indicated that as of 9:30 a.m. on 
October 13, there has been no formal request for an emergency declaration.

• John O’Brien, Genesee County Drain Commissioner’s office, was contacted. 

The most significant bottleneck to expedite completion of the Karegnondi Water 
Authority (KWA) pipeline involves road restrictions currently being imposed by 
the Lapeer County Road Commission and include: 

o All Lapeer County secondary north-south roads are tagged “no 

construction traffic” for this project except for primary roads (M-19, M-53, 
and M-24). This significantly increases distances that construction 
vehicles must travel (upwards of 15 to 20 miles) to accomplish a short jog 
either north or south. 

o Weight restrictions in the spring will cause construction to slow or stop for 
one to two months. Lapeer County has indicated that St. Clair and 
Sanilac are not imposing the weight restrictions; however, Lapeer County 
will maintain their restrictions. 

® DEQ staff indicated there is another potentially serious bottleneck concerning 
construction of the KWA pipeline. A “stop-work” order could be coming soon 
from the Lapeer County Road Commission. 

• Samir Matta from Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN), Flint’s consultant, 
was contacted for an update on the corrosion control plan and submittal of the 
Act 399 permit application. Flint operators, with the assistance of LAN, 
conducted bench tests using a corrosion inhibitor (orthophosphate) and are 
making comparisons for use with (treated water from Detroit vs. water treated 
from the Flint River). LAN is currently preparing plans and a design for 
installation of an orthophosphate feed system. LAN expects to submit the 

Act 399 permit application to the DEQ by no later than the end of this week.

FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


® Supplemental appropriations bill (House Bill 4102) passed in the House 105-0 on 
October 14 and in the Senate 37-0 on October 15. 

• E-mail sent to DLARA with draft sampling ID protocol. 

® E-mail drafted with request for schools to prepare documents/information ahead 

of DLARA visit and on-site assessment. Waiting for comments. 

• MDARD incorporated input from DEQ for the guidance document to restaurants. 
The final version is being reviewed for inclusion on the Web site. 

• The pipeline was flushed, and the 1 st round of samples for bacteriological 
analysis collected yesterday (4:00 a m. at mid-point and 7:30 a.m. at CS #3 - 
Flint Water Treatment Plant) were non-detect for total coliform. 

• The 2nd round of samples were collected yesterday evening at mid-point 
(Genesee County) and late last night at CS #3 (Flint). Results will be available 
later this evening and read first thing tomorrow morning. If the 2nd set of 
samples is all clear, the pipeline will be ready to be placed into service (from a 
technical standpoint). The pipeline, however, will not be placed into service until 
Flint, Genesee County, and Detroit agree on and establish a service contract. 

• The Dort Reservoir will not be placed into service (this facility can be bypassed) 
until Flint determines what to do with the 6 million gallons of water (chlorinated at 
approximately 100 parts per million). What they thought was a connection to the 
sanitary sewer was discovered yesterday to be a connection to the storm sewer. 

• The first weekly meeting with the city of Flint has been scheduled for October 16. 
Attendees will include: Natasha Henderson (city of Flint), George Krisztian 
(DEQ), Shelly Edgerton (DLARA), Linda Dykema (DHHS), and Dr. Eden Wells 
(DHHS). 

• A tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been requested and tentatively 
scheduled for October 16. We are waiting for confirmation from city of Flint 
officials. Due to potential scheduling conflicts, this may be rescheduled for the 
week of October 19. 

• The initial draft of the sampling protocol has been submitted to EPA, and 
comments have been received.

® Potential bottlenecks have been identified regarding load restrictions. Further 
discussions with the Lapeer County Road Commission will be necessary to 
identify potential accommodations. 

Additional action: 

Outreach was made to the Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) to ask for 
assistance with the sampling of Flint schools. The GCHD has expressed some 
reservations, and further communication will take place to strengthen the partnership.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Based upon discussions with Genesee County and the city of Flint, the portion of 
the 72-inch transmission main (pipeline) that was taken out of service, while the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant treated water from the Flint River, was flushed and 
disinfected in accordance to AWWA Standard C651-14. Two sets of samples 
were collected from two locations 16 hours apart for total coliform analysis. The 
city of Flint and Genesee County have informed the DEQ that both sets of 
samples were non-detect for total coliform. Based upon the disinfection 
procedure and the absence of total coliform from both sets of samples, the 
unused portion of the pipeline may be placed into service. 

• The initial meeting with the city of Flint has been confirmed and scheduled to 
take place at the Flint City Flail today at 10:00 a.m. In attendance will be 
representatives from DEQ, DLARA, DFHFHS, and the city of Flint. The meeting will 
cover progress by each partner to date, along with a discussion of action items 
for next week and the following: 

o Get update on service line index card conversion and identify where 
partial replacements exist 

o Make sure DHHS gets information so they can cross reference 

• Due to scheduling conflicts, the tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been 
postponed until the week of October 19. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted regarding the delivery of homeowner 
samples, and it was agreed that the current method of sample delivery was 
mutually beneficial and that the practice would remain in place. 

• The city of Flint has been contacted, and they have agreed to forward all lead 
testing requests by businesses directly to the DEQ laboratory. The DEQ 
laboratory contact information has been provided, and the city of Flint has 
distributed this information to appropriate staff. 

Additional action: 

A meeting has been requested between the DEQ and the Genesee County Health 

Department (GCPiD). A request to meet has been sent along with a list of proposed 

agenda items. A proposal for weekly meetings either by phone or in person has been 

made to GCPID so as to strengthen our partnership with them.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The Flint pipeline is ready and has been placed into service. Water from the 
Great Lakes Water Authority began flowing on Friday, October 16. 

» Continued working with Karegnondi Water Authority toward addressing the 
construction bottlenecks. 

• The corrosion control proposal was received electronically from Lockwood, 
Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN), Flint’s consultant, on October 16 (without 399 
application). Staff is reviewing the proposal and preparing comments. The 
proposal was forwarded to EPA for their review, with comments requested by 
October 19. EPA acknowledged receipt of the proposal. On October 16 LAN 
hand delivered a full-sized set of the proposal, along with a signed permit 
application. 

• The city of Flint provided information during the initial coordination meeting that 
approximately 25% of the index card conversion has taken place. The cards 
have been given to the University of Michigan-Flint for entry into GIS. The city of 
Flint has indicated that this is a slow process, and they are looking at ways to 
speed up the process. This is a manually intensive process, and they lack the 
resources to accomplish the task faster. 

• The city of Flint will provide a link to the GIS mapping, and Howard Croft of the 
city of Flint gave a short presentation on how to use the GIS mapping program. 

Additional Actions: 

• George Krisztian and Karen Tommasulo represented the DEQ in the initial 
weekly coordination meeting with the city of Flint on October 16. Present were 
representatives from DEQ, DLARA, DHHS, and the city of Flint. Each partner 
provided a brief synopsis of what their respective group had done the past week, 
and there was discussion on action steps for the following week. Additional 
discussion included presenting a unified message, creation of a homeowners 
water sampling instructions work group, and inclusion of the Genesee County 
Health Department (GCHD) for the weekly coordination meetings. 

® George Krisztian, Karen Tommasulo, and Liane Shekter Smith represented the 
DEQ in an October 16 meeting with the Flint Community Schools 
Superintendent, Bilal Tawwab. Also present were representatives from DLARA, 
DHHS, and the Principals from the first three schools that are going through the 
plumbing evaluation protocol as well as additional staff from Flint Community 
Schools. The DEQ provided an overview of the protocol that includes a plumbing 




FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


evaluation, subsequent sampling of all faucets and drinking fountains that are 
used for consumptive purposes, analysis of the samples, consolidation of the 
data, and then review of the data from a health-based exposure perspective. 
There was also discussion that the GCHD would be asked to conduct the 
sampling so that we ensure all aspects of the data are of the highest possible 
quality. There was also discussion of the need to ensure that the 
Superintendent’s office receives the data along with comments on the data 
before the data is made public. It was agreed that all partners (DEQ, DLARA, 
DHHS, the Superintendent, the city of Flint, and GCHD) would all be provided the 
data along with context before the data was released to the public. It was also 
agreed that there needed to be coordination with respect to who would be 
releasing the data to the public. 

• George Krisztian, Karen Tommasulo, and Liane Shekter Smith met on 

October 16 with James Henry of the GCHD. The purpose of the meeting was to: 

o Invite the GCHD to attend the weekly coordination meeting with the city of 
Flint. 

o Ask if the GCHD would be willing to take the samples for the school 
plumbing evaluations. 

o Invite Mr. Henry to be part of the homeowners water sampling instructions 
work group. 

o The GCHD provided a positive response on all three subjects but did 

indicate that they would need funding to assist with the sampling. GCHD 
was asked to submit a request to the DEQ so that the question of funding 
could be addressed formally.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 
Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 




Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to 
eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality is 
continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for 
Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


® On October 16 DEQ staff calculated an estimate for the number of samples that 
we expect to take per school. During our October 16 meeting with Flint 
Community Schools representatives, they supported our assumptions. Based on 
this, we estimate that if we collect 3 samples at each drinking water/cooking tap 
at each school, we can expect to collect approximately 100 samples per school 
(1 3 schools = 1 ,300 samples). This number is only for the first 1 3 locations that 
were identified in the preliminary investigation. A more comprehensive 
determination of the total number of facilities will be made after the initial pilot of 
3 schools is complete. 

• Draft language changes for Part 54 of the Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection Act, 1994 PA 451 , as amended, have been submitted to Maggie 
Pallone for review before final submission. 

• The revised draft sampling protocol was shared with DLARA, DHHS, EPA, and 
Genesee County Health Department on October 19 for comment. 

• DEQ’s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance staff is scheduled to 
observe DLARA staff conducting a plumbing assessment on October 21 . 

• Initial comments by EPA regarding Flint’s proposed corrosion control treatment 
plan were received on October 19. EPA’s comments in their entirety are 
included as an attachment. DEQ staff has been instructed to contact EPA on 
October 20 to get clarification of some of the comments. 

• On October 19 George Krisztian contacted Howard Croft, Public Works Director, 
city of Flint, to find out how the transition to Detroit Water and Sewerage 
Department (DWSD) was going. Mr. Croft indicated that Flint switched over in a 
controlled manner so as to minimize disruptions in the infrastructure. He said 
that the transition went very smoothly and that Flint is on DWSD water 

100 percent. Mr. Croft also indicated that they would be doing testing throughout 
the distribution system and they would be focusing on hardness levels to 
determine the extent to which the DWSD water had made it through the system. 
He anticipated that it would be a full week before there was a complete turnover 
of the source water.

Subject: RE: Flint VVTP PH2 SEG4 - Corrosion Control 

Mike, 

Thank-you for giving us the opportunity to review the city of Flint’s corrosion control plan. 

We believe it is necessary that Flint boosts orthophosphate dosage. Given that the distribution system 
has not received orthophosphate in over a year, we expect: that orthophosphate will need to he boosted 
to 1) meet the demand of the distribution system, 2) reach the service lines and other lead-containing 
components in premise plumbing, and 3) accelerate lead reduction at the consumer's taps. 
Orthophosphate should preferably be added in the same form as the Detroit source which is phosphoric 
acid from our understanding. This is the proposed case here, however, a simple test should be 
performed to make sure that the pH is not impacted in a significant way at the desired target dose. 

We have not been able to obtain comprehensive water quality data for the finished water 
characteristics of the Detroit water that will be fed to Flint, to assess ranges of major chemical 
characteristic fluctuations. However, based upon the email trail, Detroit water entering the Flint system 
appears to only contain around 0.4 P04/L. This concentration range is entirely too low compared to that 
needed in studies presented and published in the last 20+ years that have focused on lead released 
directly from lead pipes, and the solubility of the most likely lead orthophosphate pipes scales. We also 
strongly feel that targeted dose of 0.8 mg P04/L is also too low, for the very same reason. We would be 
glad to share with you numerous standard corrosion control and treatment reference works, best 
practices guides and published results from US and international lead corrosion control field and pilot 
studies. Secondly, the basis for that target (other communities using Lake Huron source use the same 
dose) is not scientifically derived nor does it consider water quality and the current state of Flint's 
distribution system. We have reviewed the original Detroit corrosion study and have seen some of the 
LCR monitoring data, and besides the fact that it did not directly pertain to this water source, few 
dosages were tested in the cited 1994 pipe loop study, and the higher dosage than the one 
implemented in the field currently was more effective. Based on the limited amount of data on the 
quality of Detroit water, what we know about the history of Detroit corrosion control, we think an 
orthophosphate residual of 3 to 4 mg P04/L should be the minimum starting test target residual for pipe 
passivation. It is likely that, at least initially a higher dosage will be necessary to reach the far ends of 
the distribution system and sufficiently reduce lead solubility and release from all lead sources. To allow 
flexibility, we feel the design of the chemical feed and storage systems should be able to consistently 
deliver a maximum dose of 5 to 6 mg PQ4/L, if substantial orthophosphate loss is observed, if the 
starting dose is set for the desired residual level of 3 to 4 mg/L as P04. We suggest that jar tests be 
performed in advance of orthophosphate addition to Detroit water to evaluate the impact of 
orthophosphate dose on turbidity that could result from interactions between orthophosphate and 
background Detroit water quality parameters (e.g,, aluminum, calcium, etc.}. 

We want to stress that immediately shifting to Detroit water and adding orthophosphate will not 
necessarily translate to immediate improvements. Furthermore, this is a change, albeit a return to past 
conditions. Nonetheless, a period of system upset should be anticipated. The need for a communication 
strategy and a distribution system plan are critical. 



Lastly, we see no mention of a water quality monitoring program. Two programs need to be put in place 
immediately (before return to Detroit water) to 1) identify lead sources, 2.) assess treatment 
effectiveness against lead release from all of the simultaneously operating mechanisms (solubility, 
particulate release, galvanic corrosion), and 3) assess orthophosphate levels and stability of water 
quality in the distribution system. 

There are multiple sources of lead in the Flint distribution system to the consumers' taps, such as: pipes; 
leaded brass; leaded solder; accumulations on old galvanized steel pipes; possibly accumulated on 
copper or some plastic pipes, it is critical that the fate of orthophosphate in the distribution system is 
understood, and how effective it is against each type of lead source, so dosing adjustment can be 
properly made. For this purpose, we recommend that a number of residences throughout Flint that 
meet the following plumbing criteria, be identified for an assessment of the contribution lead from the 
different potential service line and interior plumbing sources, through detailed mapping of plumbing 
materials, lengths, sizes, and location and type of inline devices and faucets using profile sampling. For 
confidence in interpretation, probably at least 5 sites from each of the configurations will be 
necessary. The configurations we would estimate to be most important (but should be changed or 
added to if local construction practice indicates it's necessary): Lead service line, galvanized steel 
interior plumbing; lead service line, copper with leaded solder joints; Sead service line, piastic interior 
plumbing. It is also possible that interior plumbing may differ from the material used for the customer- 
side service line segment. We would be glad to discuss the specifics of this sampling effort. 

For the purpose of assessing stability of water quality in the distribution system and to inform on 
orthophosphate residual adjustment, we suggest that 8 to 10 locations in the distribution system be 
selected to measure pH, alkalinity, orthophosphate, turbidity and iron on a weekly basis. These could be 
collected from ICR sampling locations, or other readily-accessible buildings, should be located at a 
distribution of locations in the distribution system and should be collected after a flush sufficiently long 
to assure that "fresh" distribution system water is being measured. Research has shown that over time, 
orthophosphate can reduce disinfectant demand associated with corroding metallic distribution system 
materials. These measurements need to be performed in the field and can simply be done with a 
portable HACH test kit or spectrophotometer, 

A lead sampling plan needs to be in place to access the effectiveness of water change and treatment 
boost. LCR monitoring sites with confirmed lead service lines can be in the sampling pool. Sampling 
should consist of a 1 liter first draw sample (LCR sample without 5 minute pre-flush), followed by an 
additional flushed sample or two depending on profile sample results which is intended to capture 
major lead source(s). The specific details of this effort need to be worked out by the technical 
committee as soon as possible. We would gladly work with Flint on establishing a water sampling 
program to identity and verify lead service line sites. The plan and initial sampling effort should be 
performed before the switch so that one baseline sample set is collected. 

Lastly, our strength does not fall under full-scale pump and chemical feed delivery systems. We would 
only say that the systems need to be scaled-up in size to accommodate our suggested dosing needs. 
Also, there is the some discussion about diverting water to the Dort reservoir and an associated 
orthophosphate feed system. We are not familiar with the reservoir but are wondering if it is an open 
reservoir? 



Of course this is a iot of information to share and we would gladly be available to discuss the technica 
and scientific basis for our suggestions. 

Let us know if you have any questions and thanks again, 

Darren and Mike

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• Action Step #1 has been incorporated into the After Action Plan (Action Step #4). 

• It was determined that the information in Action Step #1 0 would be 
communicated better in person and has, therefore, been incorporated into Action 
Step #13. 

® DEQ staff has tentatively identify the week of October 26 to meet with 

representatives from the remaining 10 locations in the Flint Community Schools 
who were not present at the October 16 meeting at the Superintendent’s office. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to request a meeting regarding lead education 
materials for schools. 

• The first plumbing assessment has been scheduled for Friday, October 23. The 
subsequent sampling of the first facility has been scheduled for Saturday, 

October 24. This decision was made jointly among DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS in 
an effort to ensure that sampling staff could properly evaluate the sampling 
protocol without the added pressure of completing the sampling process before 
students arrived on-site. 

• The DEQ Laboratory has created a tillable PDF form for use in the school 
sampling protocol. This form was created to streamline the information gathering 
process. The form was submitted for review by staff in DEQ, DHHS, and 
DLARA, and comments were subsequently incorporated. The form is now 
complete and ready for use. 

• The corrosion control treatment plan (CCTP) and permit application were 
received late last Friday, October 16, and were reviewed. Our review comments 
were provided to Flint’s consultant [Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (LAN)]. 
The CCTP was forwarded to EPA on October 16, and their comments were 
received on October 19. A conference call was held on October 20 between our 
staff and Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA to discuss the main comments 
(EPA’s and DEQ’s) to confirm that both agencies concur with the design and 
proposed corrosion control dosages. We are currently preparing a revised set of 
comments, based on our discussion with EPA. The revised comments will be 
sent to EPA to confirm concurrence before sending to LAN. 

• An Act 399 permit will be issued to the city of Flint to install corrosion control 
treatment following receipt of revised plans, specs, and - as needed - a permit 
application that addresses the revised review comments. 

• DEQ staff has contacted DHHS to schedule a meeting to discuss the 
development of childcare facility guidance. This guidance will be similar in nature 
to what is being done in schools but will be tailored to address the specific 



FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


concerns with younger children and the smaller plumbing infrastructure of typical 
childcare facilities. 

Additional Actions: 

® Standing meetings with the city of Flint have been scheduled for Fridays at 
10:00 a.m. These meetings have been scheduled through December 18. In 
addition, a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant has been scheduled for 
October 23. The DEQ be taking video footage of the tour, showing the 
coordinated efforts being taken by the city of Flint, DEQ, DHHS, and DLARA. 
Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) has been invited to the Friday 
meetings as well as the tour, and GCHD is in the process of determining if they 
can participate. 

• A meeting was held between staff from the DEQ, DLARA, and DHHS to discuss 
details regarding the flow and coordination of efforts for the school sampling 
protocol. It was mutually agreed that it was best to only do one school at first so 
that we can ensure that the process runs smoothly from partner to partner. The 
first plumbing evaluation will be done at Freeman Elementary School on Friday, 
October 23. Steve Busch of the DEQ will accompany staff from DLARA to 
answer questions they might have during their plumbing evaluations. The 
subsequent water sampling effort will take place the next day, on Saturday, 
October 24. It was agreed that taking the samples on Saturday would allow staff 
to be able to evaluate the sampling process without the added pressure of 
ensuring that the sampling was complete before students arrived at the building. 

• DEQ Director Dan Wyant, Jim Sygo, George Krisztian, and Karen Tommasulo 
held a conference call with Dr. Susan Hedman, EPA’s Regional Administrator, 
and other representatives from EPA to discuss the EPA’s formation of the Flint 
Safe Drinking Water Task Force. The purpose of the Task Force is to provide 
one-stop shopping for technical assistance for the optimization of corrosion 
controls for the switch from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the 
Karegnondi Water Authority. EPA requested a point of contact for the DEQ, and 
Director Wyant suggested Chief Deputy Director Jim Sygo. EPA agreed that this 
was an appropriate choice and requested a formal letter indicating Chief Deputy 
Director Sygo as the point of contact. 

• DHHS has indicated that the total water filter/pitcher distribution for the period of 
October 6 through October 20 was 9,373 units.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 


• The initial After Action Plan meeting was held on October 22. Topics covered 
were: 

o The discussion of the roles of each team member 
o The scope of the After Action Plan 

o The time frame in which the After Action Plan is to be completed 
The main components of the After Action Plan are: 

o An After Action Review Summary time line that details critical events in 
chronological order, asking key questions, and providing explanations for 
actions taken 

o Implementation of the Governor’s 1 0-point Action Plan 
o An evaluation of if DEQ made mistakes and, if so, what they were 

o An evaluation of lessons learned, defining what we can do better/differently 

in the future 

• Participated on an October 22 conference call with the EPA’s Flint Safe Drinking 
Water Task Force to discuss proposed sampling protocol and the comments 
received from EPA. Agreed to reconvene a call next week to discuss how the 
pilot sampling effort goes, what went well, what might need to be adjusted, etc. 

® A summary of our discussion with EPA regarding Flint’s corrosion control plan 
was provided to Darren Lytle and Michael Schock of EPA. The summary 
included confirmation of the actual phosphate dosage from the Detroit Lake 
Huron Water Treatment Plant. 

• Proper dosages are now confirmed, based on incoming phosphate residual at 
Flint. A product cut-sheet to confirm NSF approval and maximum dose is to be 
provided shortly. Flint’s consultant (Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc.) will 
also confirm proper sizing of the feed pumps. Anticipate receiving this 
information on October 23, which will facilitate issuance of the Act 399 permit. 

® An updated monitoring schedule is completed and signed. The schedule will be 
mailed to the city of Flint on October 23. A copy of the updated monitoring 
schedule is attached. 

® An e-mail was sent to John O’Brien of Genesee County informing him of our 

concern over improper soil erosion control measures at the pipeline job site and 
what corrective measures were being taken to avoid a potential halt of 
construction by the Lapeer County Road Commission. Genesee County has not 
responded thus far.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update

Additional Actions: 

® A conference call was held among representatives from DEQ/DLARA/DHHS to 
further discuss ways to ensure that the efforts of all three agencies were 
coordinated. It was determined that weekly calls providing updates to the group 
as a whole would be beneficial. DEQ also agreed to copy DLARA and DHHS on 
their daily update report to the Governor’s office. 

® Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian contacted Flint Community 

Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab to obtain permission to allow the Detroit 
Free Press to take footage of the water sampling process to be conducted at 
Freeman Elementary School on Saturday, October 24. Superintendent Tawwab 
gave his permission, stating that it would not be an issue since there would not 
be any students present. 

® DLARA completed additional review of documents at the Flint repository to assist 
with the sequencing at the schools. 

• Flint is able to provide DLARA plumbing inspectors with on-site workspace; 
additional documentation gives greater guidance on locations for plumbing 
fixtures. 

• DLARA received confirmation from DEQ that bottles and necessary equipment 
will be available for sampling start on Saturday, October 24.

Dear Mr. Wright: 

SUBJECT: Revised Drinking Water Monitoring Schedule - 2015 
Monthly Operation Reports 
Siting Plans and Record Keeping 

Monitoring Schedule: 

Enclosed is your revised Drinking Water Monitoring Schedule for remainder of calendar 
year 201 5 outlining the minimum requirements for your public water supply. Your 
schedule has been revised based on the City’s change in source of its drinking water 
from the treatment of the Flint River utilizing the City’s Water Treatment Plant to the 
Great Lakes Water Authority/Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collect samples 
early in the monitoring period of the year indicated on the schedule. If you use a private 
laboratory you are required to report the results to us within the first ten days of the 
month following the month that you received the results. To receive credit for 
monitoring, the "WSSN” (water supply serial number), the "Site Code," and "County" 
must appear on the sample result. Bottles will NOT be mailed automatically. If you use 
the Department of Environmental Quality Laboratory, you can order bottles by calling 
517-335-8184. Be certain of the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
sampling and analysis method requirements for hold times. 

Monthly Operation Report (MOR) Requirements: 

The City shall submit MORs as required under Administrative Rule 1502 (R325.11502). 
Please note required coliform bacteria monitoring results and associated chlorine 
residual monitoring shall be submitted to the department within the first 10 days 
following the end of the required monthly monitoring period. In addition, monthly 
operation reports shall be submitted to the department during the month following the 
month for which the monthly operation report was prepared.

Disinfection By-Product Sample Siting Plans: 

The City of Flint shall continue routine standard monitoring of disinfection by-products, 
according to your Disinfection & Disinfectants By-Product (DDBP) plan which identifies 
8 sites for routine quarterly monitoring. 

Lead and Copper Monitoring Requirements and Site Sample Pool 

Please note distribution system monitoring for water quality parameters (WQPs) 
continues at the expanded set of 25 sites per quarter. Lead and copper monitoring in 
accordance with the requirements of Administrative Rule 710a (R325. 10710a) is being 
required for the 6 month period between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The City 
must ensure its sample site pool is large enough to collect the number of lead and 
copper tap samples required. All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall 
be selected from the poo! of targeted sampling sites. 

The City shall also conduct additional operational monitoring to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of corrosion control treatment. 


Record Keeping: 


The City shall maintain all monitoring records in accordance with all applicable 
requirements under the Administrative Rules including Rule 720a (R325. 10720a), 

Rule 1506 (R325. 11506), and Rule 1507 (R325.11507). 

The Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act requires certain reports to be submitted to this 
office each year. Please remember that cross connection reports and annual pumpage 
reports are due by March 31 , and the Consumer Confidence Report is due by July 1 .

2015 Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 

Please Monitor Early: Collect samples early in the monitoring period (month, quarter, 
year) of the year indicated on the schedule. Bacteriological and partial chemistry 
samples should be collected close to the shipping time and sent overnight delivery to 
assure sample holding times are not exceeded (30 and 48 hour hold times respectively). 
We also recommend avoiding mailing bacteriological samples immediately preceding or 
following a holiday because samples tend to exceed the 30 hour hold time. When this 
occurs, a repeat sample must be collected as soon as possible upon notification. 

If you use a private laboratory please report the results to us within the first ten days of 
the month following the month that you received the results. A list of certified 
laboratories is available on request. If samples are not collected as indicated on your 
monitoring schedule, you will incur a monitoring violation and possibly a fine. For 
information on the fines policy, visit http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking 
Water, Community Water Supply, and Administrative Fines (under Laws and Rules). 


To receive credit for monitoring, you must include the "WSSN” (water supply serial 
Dumber), the "Site Code," and the "County" when you submit samples for analysis. 
Site codes are listed on your monitoring schedule. 


Special Instructions If You Use The DEQ Laboratory: Bottles will NOT be mailed 
automatically. To order bottles, call the DEQ Laboratory at 517-335-8184 or download 
the form EQP 2301 Requisition for Water Sample Units from www.michigan.gov/deq. 
Click on Key Topics, Laboratory Services, Drinking Water, Obtaining The Necessary 
Sampling Units, and 'test list’. Please note that the DEQ laboratory is closed on most 
state holidays. The DEQ laboratory prices are subject to change without notice. 

Special Instructions For Automated Partial Chemistry, VQC and TTHM Samples : These 
sample bottles must be cooled and preserved during shipment to the laboratory. If you 
use the DEQ laboratory, you will receive the ice pack, acid dropper (if necessary) and 
small cooler when you request the bottles. Samples must be preserved correctly to be 
used for compliance purposes. To avoid resampling follow instructions contained with 
the sample bottle. If you would like more information, contact the DEQ lab, at 
517-335-8184, or contact this office. 

Cyanide : Previously, supplies that chlorinated the water were waived from monitoring 
for cyanide. The U.S. EPA now requires all supplies to sample the entry point for 
cyanide. 

UCMR3 Monitoring : You may have monitoring requirements in 2015 under the third 
Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3). The U.S. EPA will contact you 
directly if your water supply is required to monitor in 2015. A list of laboratories certified 
to analyze the samples collected for UCMR3 is available at 

http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3/upload/lablist.pdf. Contact 
the U.S. EPA with questions.

Reminder if Lead and Copper Monitoring Due This Year : Provide individual lead tap 
results to people who receive water from sites that you sampled, even if lead was not 
detected, within 30 days of learning the results. Send us a certification that you met all 
the delivery requirements along with a sample copy of the customer notice within 3 
months after the end of the monitoring period. Water supplies that failed to distribute the 
Consumer Notice of Lead Results must include the following statement in their CCR, 
"During the year, we failed to provide lead results to persons served at the sites that 
were tested as required by the Lead and Copper Rule.” To download the Lead and 
Copper Report and Consumer Notice of Lead Result Certificate in Microsoft Word or 
PDF format, visit www.michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community 
Water Supply, and Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures}. 

Annual Reports : These reports are due to this office each year. 

• The Cross Connection Report, due by March 31 , describes the status of your 
local cross connection control program. Manufactured housing communities are 
exempt from this requirements until 2016. 

Each year, water supplies must submit this report, even if a formal program has 
not been implemented. If cross connections do not exist in your water system, 
indicate so on the report. Download the Cross Connection Report form from 
http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures), instructions are 
included with the form. 

• The Annual Pumpage/Usage Report, due by March 31 , is required of water 
supplies that do not submit monthly operation reports. 

This summary of water pumpage and water use must be submitted by each 
water supply that does not submit a monthly operation report. To manage our 
natural resources, pumpage data are compiled to determine water use demands 
in Michigan. Download the Annual Pumpage/Usage Report form from 
http://michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Reporting Forms (under Manuals, Forms & Brochures). Please be sure 
to indicate the appropriate units on the report (e.g. million gallons or gallons). 

• The Consumer Confidence Report, due by July 1 to your customers, to your 
local health department and to this office, describes the quality of the water and 
characterizes the risks, if any, from exposure to contaminants detected.. 

Electronic delivery methods may be used to distribute the CCR to bill-paying 
customers, provided the method is direct. A paper copy must be delivered to bill- 
paying customers who request it or known to be unable to receive the CCR 
electronically. For more information on e-delivery, visit 
www.michigan.gov/deqwater. Click on Drinking Water, Community Water 
Supply, Consumer Confidence Report Rule (under Laws and Rules).

RICK SNYDER 

GOVERNOR 


DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

Lansing 


NICK LYON 

DIRECTOR 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Jennifer Eisner 

DRAFT (517)241-2112 


MDHHS releases recent data outlining blood lead levels in Flint 

Follow-up care, case management resources continue for families 

LANSING, Mich. - The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today issued 
preliminary data regarding blood lead levels in Flint children and adults. The department’s 
summary report shows that 30 of 1,361 adults and children tested in Flint since October 1 had 
elevated levels. 


MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health Department to reach out to families 
testing with higher levels and help them reduce their exposure to lead sources. The report is 
intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and provide cumulative 
total numbers. 


“Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources,” said Dr. Eden Wells, 
MDHSS chief medical executive. “We have made progress in testing and identifying those with 
elevated blood lead levels, and the department will continue to work closely with the county 
health department to reach these families. We will update these numbers on a regular basis and 
remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education.” 

Information was gathered from tests administered citywide to 1,361 children and adults since 
October 1. Twenty-one children age 17 or younger had elevated blood lead levels. Nine adults 
over the age 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels. 

The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of 
elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter, and captures both capillary 
and venous blood tests that have been reported to MDFIHS since the beginning of October. 
People who have had multiple tests are counted only once. The full report is posted online at 
www.michigan.gov/flintwater and will be updated as more data becomes available. 

The testing is part of the state’s action plan to address health concerns related to Flint’s water 
infrastructure. 


When reviewing trend data for past years, the third quarter reflects the months during which the 
risk of lead exposure is highest (July through September). From the third quarter of 2010, there 
was a citywide elevated blood lead level in children less than six years of age of 8.3 percent, 
which decreased over the next three years to 4. 1 percent in the third quarter of 2013. In the third 
quarter of 2014, citywide elevated blood lead levels in children less than six years of age 
increased to 7.5 percent, and 6.4 percent in 2015. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, 
increased testing activities began in the city of Flint.

Last month, MDHHS collaborated with the county health department and local partners to 
distribute educational resources and informational letters to Flint parents regarding lead testing. 
The state provided supplemental funding to support GCFED nursing staff to conduct direct 
outreach to families when an elevated blood lead level has been detected. During these follow-up 
visits, nurses coordinate with environmental health investigators to identify lead exposures, 
address questions and concerns, provide filters and further information, and meet with families in 
their home environment. 

MDHHS continues to provide free water filters and replacement cartridges to Flint residents at 
four locations including the MDHHS Flint offices and the Genesee County Community Action 
Resource Department. For a full list of locations and hours of distribution, visit 
www.michigan.gov/flintwater. 

To help residents properly install water filters, and to demonstrate how to replace the original 
when it expires, MDHHS has created an instructional on the MDHHS YouTube channel. For 
additional updates on Flint water including updates on blood lead levels and testing results, visit 
www.michigan.gov/flintwater.

• They will have strong screening in place to help ensure appropriate grouping of topics and that the show 
isn’t dominated by callers with agendas like Progress MI. 

® Progress MI is undertaking push to have their members call-in to “hold the governor accountable and ask 
the tough Qs about his pro-corporate agenda.” 



* Comms team is pushing out to various and key stakeholders via the RPA report, a Reinvention News 
newletter to subscribers, and on social media. The roads coalition is also pushing out. We will also advise

Flint water 

® Community activists are continuing to raise public concerns about the quality of Flint water, and the 
talk has grown uglier. 

o Longtime activist A.C. Dumas is raising the issue of an "environmental racism" lawsuit, 
o The president of the Michigan chapter of Al Sharpton's National Action Network told the 
media on Tuesday that Flint water is "almost as bad as gas chambers for Jews." 

Topline points 

• Flint residents need and deserve clean, safe water. 

® There is potentially some short-term assistance the state and other groups can provide, but Flint 
needs significant upgrades to its water infrastructure to replace an aging system that has long been 
neglected. 

« The state recently awarded the city $2 million in grants to help with some of the issues, including a 
plan to locate the areas where pipes are most in need of repair to allow the city to prioritize its 
replacement projects. 

® The Department of Environmental Quality continues to work with the city to monitor water quality. 

Only if asked: 

® If asked about the accusations of racism, we should push back hard. 

o These are water infrastructure problems that have been growing in Flint for decades, 
o The change from Detroit water to water from Lake Huron via a new pipeline was a plan 
created by and supported by the Flint City Council and the mayor. The emergency manager 
at the time signed off on the plan at the urging of the council and mayor, 
o State leaders have worked with the city to help through its financial struggles to improve 
public safety, services and the overall quality of life. 



Background 

® The administration is looking into a variety of options that could improve the color and smell of the 
water while continuing to explain that the water is safe, and that Flint's water infrastructure needs 
significant upgrades for a long-term solution. 

o Options include working with area foundations and businesses to purchase filters to be 
attached to kitchen sinks that would improve water color and smell, 
o Another option would be to make bottled water available to affected residents. 

« Flint's water issues are an infrastructure issue. 

o The system is 80 years old, and has not been adequately maintained for about 40 years, 
o The temporary water source - the Flint River - has harder water than the previous source, 
which was the Detroit Water and Sewer District. 

■ The harder water exacerbates the problems in the aging water pipes, and residents 
have reported an increase in problems since the April switch from Detroit water to 
Flint River water. 

o The city is in the process of building a new pipeline to link with Lake Huron. 

* The work will take a year or more to complete. 

* Even when linked to Lake Huron, problems with the city pipes will remain, 
o Replacing the pipes costs about $1 million per mile. 

* The city hopes to spend about $8 million in water infrastructure repairs. 

• Community leaders have demanded the city return to Detroit water. 

o This would not solve the ongoing infrastructure issues, 
o DWSD would charge about $1 million a month to hook up Flint again. 

* The city can't afford this. 

■ The additional cost would be passed along to ratepayers. Residents already are 
paying a lot for their water, about $150 a month. 

How can the state assist? 

• The DEQ Drinking Water program works with communities around the state to ensure that 
municipalities provide customers with clean, safe drinking water. 

« Municipal water supplies are tested rigorously and regularly for more than 90 regulated 

contaminants, including microbial contaminants that pose an immediate public health concern. 

® We have awarded Flint $2 million in grants for water system infrastructure improvements, part of 
an overall $8 million plan to help cities through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. 

« Flint is among 11 municipalities receiving grants through the program. 

o Municipalities are eligible for the grants of they are experiencing one or more conditions 
indicative of "probable financial stress," as defined by Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local 
Financial Stability and Choice Act. 

o Under the grant program, funding may be used to pay for specific projects, services, or 
strategies that move a city, village, or township toward financial stability, 
o There was $8 million appropriated for the program with a $2 million cap, per local unit. 

® A $900,000 grant will allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection survey of the 
city water lines. 

o The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak severity, allowing the 
city to prioritize leak repair. 



o The project also covers the expense of conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition 
assessment on a portion of the city's pipes, 
o The assessment will guide the city's water main replacement program. 

The city also was awarded $1.1 million to shut down its current Water Pollution Control Facility 
incinerator and replace it with new facilities which will allow for the disposal of waste in landfills, 
o The existing facilities are not up to federal Environmental Protection Agency standards. 

Dennis Muchmore and representatives from Treasury, DEQ and The Office of Urban Initiatives met 
with a delegation of concerned pastors to discuss the problem in early February.

GOVERNOR 


State of Michigan 
DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY 


R. KEVIN CLINTON 
STATE TREASURER 


DATE: March 23, 2015 

TO: Rick Snyder, Governor 

FROM: R. Kevin Clinton, Treasurer 

SUBJECT: Status of Financially Stressed Local Governments 

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Flint 

Emergency Manager: Gerald Ambrose 
Appointed: January 13, 2015 
Anticipated Exit: April 2015 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the city’s water system 
through improved waste management, leak detection, and pipe assessments. 

- An EM Order is being prepared that will restructure its SRF loans. This would free up 
approximately $2.2M allowing the city to further improve its water system. 

- The City of Flint had informed residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water 
Standards Act, after unsafe levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM, a disinfectant by-product) 
were found in the water. Recent testing by the Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality (MDEQ) Testing Lab showed that the total TTHM levels for the month of 
February are well within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for safe 
water. However, because EPA regulations require that the four month average for all 
testing sites be within certain guidelines, the city is still considered to be non-compliant 
by the MDEQ. Monthly testing will be ongoing, and is being conducted by several 
parties. 

The city hired Veolia to provide an analysis of the water system, including recommended 
improvements, and associated costs. Recommendations included water plant 
improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and procedures, and 
better communication with customers. On March 19, 2015, the report was presented to 
the Flint Water Advisory Committee, but the presentation broke down due to citizen 
unrest. An International City/County Management Association (ICMA) comprehensive 
public safety study has been completed, and was presented to the City Council on 
January 22, 2015. Several recommendations for both police and fire are currently being 
reviewed. Of the 16 major recommendations for public safety, the following four are 
most crucial: 


vwwv.michigan.gov/treasury 



Page 2 


o Establish more aggressive protocols for responding to service demands from the 
public. 

o Equip a minimum of one marked patrol car with an automated external 
defibrillator (AED) and an automatic license plate reader, and equip every car 
with e-ticket readers and printers, 
o Develop a robust in-service training program. 

o Establish and publish a clear multi-year strategic plan that includes specific 
performance goals and objectives for all units. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The General Fund accumulated deficit for FY 2014 was $9M. In FY 2013, the General 
Fund had an accumulated deficit of $12. 9M. Noted reductions included $5.6M from 
Parks & Recreation, 2.6M from Community Development, 1.8M from Public Safety, and 
$1.7 from Building Inspections. 

If the city loses the lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the budget does not assume this 
potential additional $5M to $6M expense, which will grow at a rate equal to the general 
rise in healthcare costs. 

Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January 2016 

Recent Developments 

- The city was awarded $143. 5K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety through 
updated technology. 

- A fire union collective bargaining agreement has been approved. The estimated annual 
cost savings is approximately $500K by reducing overtime and paid leave. 

A Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal has been placed on the May 
2015 ballot. If approved by voters this will raise an additional 6 mills, or $3M, for fire 
and police pension funding and retiree healthcare. 

Poor actuarial advice has lead retiree health care in the city to be underfunded. EM 
Coulter has proposed changing retiree contracts to replace cost of city-provided health 
insurance with a stipend for retirees to purchase their own health coverage. The EM’s 
plan would offer a single retiree roughly $ 150/month, a couple could receive 
$350/month, with a family cap set at $425/month. This change would reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1 M to 600K annually. 

The EM submitted his proposed changes to City Council in March; and they did not act 
within the statutory deadline. The Treasurer’s approval will be needed before the plan 
can be implemented. It is anticipated that the changes would be implemented in June or 
July of 20 15. 

- FY 2014 ended with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $736K out of a total budget 
of $21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 2013 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Noted areas of increased expenditures within the governmental funds included Public 
Safety by $1. 1M, Public Works by $700K, and Culture and Recreation by $600K. 



Page 3 


Significant Actions/Issues 

The police and fire pension plan is 30% funded. The general employee pension plan is 
22% funded. The aforementioned Firefighters and Police Officer Retirement Act ballot 
proposal attempts to address the pension funding shortfall. 

Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 

Police collective bargaining agreements must be finalized. 

Increase and stabilize pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) funding 
levels. 

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Kevin Clinton, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Recent Developments 

The City of Detroit held its first statutorily-required Revenue Estimating Conference on 
February 20, 2015. The conference principals, Jay Wortley of Treasury, John Hill of the 
City of Detroit, and George Fulton of the University of Michigan, approved the 
consensus revenues as presented. The principals agreed that the revenue estimates were 
conservative. 

- At the FRC’s February 23, 2015 meeting, the FRC approved, and referred to the newly 
formed Finance and Enterprise Resource subcommittee for further review, the city’s 
revenue estimates that were presented at the aforementioned Revenue Estimating 
Conference. The city will be incorporating the revenue estimates into its Four-Year 
Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) that will be presented to the FRC at its March 23, 
2015 meeting for the Commission’s review. The FRC also approved the city’s debt 
service requirements report and several operational contracts. 

Treasury hired Ron Rose as the Executive Director (ED) for the Office of the FRC within 
the Department. His start date was March 2, 2015. Treasury is in the process of filling 
other key staff positions and has engaged the financial consulting services of 
UHY. Treasury has also engaged Martha Kopacz from Phoenix Management 
Services. Ms. Kopacz and her team acted as independent financial experts for Judge 
Rhodes in the city’s Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings. Among other duties, the 
consultants will provide assistance in reviewing and analyzing the Plan for the FRC. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city will be submitting its Four-Year Financial and Operating Plan to the FRC on 
March 23, 2015 for review, with FRC action expected on April 20, 2015. The city’s Plan 
will encompass the second year (FYI6) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year budget 
and use this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY17, FY18, and FY19). 
Ensuring that the Plan is based on sound assumptions and that the city’s operational 
budgets and actual spending conform to the Plan will be one of the FRC’s most 
significant tasks.

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Hamtramek 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $622K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a property reappraisal 
which will provide updated and accurate assessing records, upgrade City Hall security, 
and enhance public safety through improved street lighting. 

The Police Chief resigned on March 11, 2015. Lieutenant Ann Moise was appointed 
Acting Police Chief. 

Deputy City Manager/Treasurer John Gabor start date was February 2, 201 5. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A complaint was filed in the federal court by Hamtramek retirees over changes to 
healthcare benefits in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently 
unknown, but the city is confident that the benefits in question were improperly offered 
and were rightfully terminated. 

The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 2015 to $4.3M 
in FY 2019. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. These increases were included in Emergency Manager Square’s two- 
year budget. 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed: September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The City Council voted on January 27, 2015 to suspend City Administrator Karen Folks. 
This vote was taken despite two Emergency Manager Orders that prohibit termination 
until October 2015 and establish a process for termination. The City Administrator and 
City Council negotiated a separation agreement which was approved by the RTAB on 
March 12, 2015. The RTAB also approved the City Council’s appointment of the Finance 
Director as Interim City Administrator. A search firm will be hired to begin the process 
of selecting a new City Administrator. 

The city was expecting to issue a bond tender offer beginning in March to reduce 
outstanding debt. However, the tender offer has been delayed due to the uncertainty 
between the City Council and City 7 Administrator. A timeline to complete the bond 
tender process will be developed by the various parties in late March 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 5 


- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the Emergency Manager’s authority to reduce 
other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary' disposition is 
pending. No date has been set to hear this motion. 

- City Hall will be relocating to a temporary facility in May 2015. The present facility is in 
poor condition. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 

Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $910K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the water system through 
water main replacements and fire hydrant repairs, and to complete a property reappraisal 
which will provide updated and accurate assessing records. Additionally, the city will 
provide community enhancement through blight management and sidewalk replacement. 
On Febaiary 2, 2015, the City Commission unanimously approved a one-year contract 
extension for City Manager Darwin Watson. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- On January 20, 2015, the City Commission passed a resolution adopting a fund balance 
policy consistent with Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) Best Practices. 
The RTAB approved the resolution on January 28, 2015. 

- FY 2014 audited General Fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total 
budget of S6.1M. 


Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $350K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety through 
improved street lighting. 

The city signed a contract with UHY to provide part-time financial services until a 
permanent solution can be found. The RTAB approved the contract on January 13, 2015. 
The City Council cancelled the contracted City Administrator search with the Michigan 
Municipal League (MML) and appointed Wayne O’Neal as full-time City Administrator. 
On February 10, 2015, the RTAB approved the City’s resolution appointing Mr. O’Neal. 
The city continues to have trouble attracting qualified candidates, and filling higher level 
administrative positions. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The RTAB’s Annual Evaluation for the Governor was not favorable, citing a lack of local 
financial literacy, political infighting, and an inability to develop a balanced multi-year 
budget. For these reasons, the Board did not recommend removal of RTAB oversight at 
this time. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System (MERS) pension contributions are anticipated to 
increase from $1 8M in FY 2015 to $2.4M in FY 2016 because of accelerated funding for 
closed plans. 



Page 6 


The city has been unable to balance their five-year budget. Previous budgets project 
deficit spending in FY 2016, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 2017. To avoid this 
eventuality, significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years. 
Flowever, an action plan to reduce expenses is not forthcoming from the city. 

Pontiac 

RTAB Appointed: August 19, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Louis Schimmel, Keith Sawdon, Robert Burgess 
Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $125K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used for community enhancement 
through blight management. 

In April 2014, the Final Emergency Manager Order was amended to create a Deputy 
Mayor position. A suitable candidate was not found through a Michigan Municipal 
League (MML) search. A new search firm has been hired to recruit a Deputy Mayor as 
part of the transition back to Flome Rule. 

Per the audit, the General Fund’s accumulated fund balance for FY 2014 is 
approximately $5M out of a total budget of $27M. 

The City Charter Revision Commission submitted a proposed Charter by the February 
10, 2015 deadline and the proposed Charter will be on the May 2015 ballot. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- The General Fund is structurally balanced in FY 2015 but expenditures are projected to 
exceed revenues by $360K due to deferred projects from FY 2014. 

- Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Michael Warren dismissed the city’s condemnation 
lawsuit involving the Phoenix Center because the city failed to include compensation for 
the lien placed on the property. The city is preparing an appeal of the decision to the U.S. 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit in the 
United States District Court was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge 
Avern Cohn. The lawsuit challenges former Emergency Manager Schimmel’ s 
elimination of retiree healthcare and replacement with an annual stipend. The General 
Employees Retirement System (GERS) Pension Fund is significantly overfunded and the 
parties are exploring options to use the overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. 

On March 17, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial a previous 
lower court dismissal of a previous 2013 suit which challenged the EM ordered 
nonpayment of $3.9 million into a VEBA tnist for the fiscal year ending 2012. This 
appellate order is not a judgment against the city, rather it allows the previously 
dismissed lawsuit to proceed. The actual liability of the city will be determined either by 
a future settlement or by a final determination of the Oakland County Circuit Court. 

The GERS Board proposal was submitted to the court on January 30, 2015.

Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $855K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to complete a property reappraisal to 
provide updated and accurate assessing records, enhance the water system through fire 
hydrant repairs, and enhancing public safety through the creation of a multi-jurisdictional 
narcotics team, police officer training, deployment of an additional police officer, 
providing a backup powder source, and updating technology. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The FY 2014 General Fund accumulated deficit is $767K out of a total budget of $1 1M.

Consent Agreement Consultant: N/A (P.A. 72) 

Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $592K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety through 
improved street lighting, along with infrastructure replacements to City Hall. 

Deborah Hayes-Price has been promoted to Chief of Police to replace former Police 
Chief Jeffrey Harris who retired in January. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- U.S. Steel annual $1M tax settlement payment to the city has expired. 

- General Fund revenues exceeded expenditures by $885K in FY 2014 and the 
accumulated fund balance was $1.9M. 

- A reduction in healthcare benefits for active employees and retirees was implemented on 
November 1, 2014. The city estimates an annual savings of $400K. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 21, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The township was awarded $274K through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, 
and Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance public safety 
through improved street lighting and increased police services. 

The State Treasurer rejected a decision by the Township Board to extend the contract 
with the current township attorney at a cost that was twice the amount of the lowest 
bidder. The Consent Agreement Consultant, Robert Burgess, issued an order requiring 
the township to extend a contract for legal services to the lowest bidder, Giarmarco, 
Mullins & Horton, P.C. This is one example of the difficulty the Consent Agreement 
Consultant has encountered in his efforts to have the Supervisor and Township Board 
comply with provisions of the Consent Agreement. 

The State Treasurer approved an amendment to the Fire Services Contract with the City 
of Ferndale on March 1 1, 2015. This amendment is projected to reduce annual costs to 
the township by $4K thru the end of 201 5.

Significant Actions/Issues 

The Michigan State Police continues to provide police services to the township. The 
Department of Treasury and the Michigan State Police continue to work with the 
township and are reviewing a proposal from the City of Hazel Park to provide police 
services to the township. 

The State Treasurer approved the township’s 2015 budget on December 16, 2014, with 
the requirement that the township work with Treasury to implement additional budget 
amendments to improve its overall effectiveness. No additional actions have occurred to 
implement these additional budget amendments as the township was without the services 
of a financial consultant from the time of budget adoption through March 1, 2015. 

The township currently has an aging accounts payable in excess of $200K. 

NEUTRAL EVALUATION 

Highland Park 

Financial Review Team Appointed: December 2, 2013 
Financial Emergency Declared: January 30, 2014 
PA 436 Option Selected: Neutral Evaluation 

Recent Developments 

The city was awarded $2M through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and 
Townships Grant Program. These funds will be used to enhance the city’s water system 
through meter replacement, leak detection, and system repairs. 

- Cathy Square, former Hamtramck Emergency Manager, was hired to fill the position of 
City Administrator. 

- Huron Consulting has been hired to prepare a request for proposal (RFP) to solicit firms 
to operate and maintain the city’s water and sewer systems, as required by the city’s Plan 
of Adjustment. The proposals are due on April 20, 2015. 

- BenStaff has been hired by the city to make recommendations that will reduce healthcare 
costs. 

The law firm of Lewis & Munday has been hired to assist the city with the restructuring 
of the other post-employment benefits (OPEB). 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city selected Tetra-Tech to prepare a water and sewer rate study. A draft study was 
completed on February 20, 2015. This study provides the city with proposed rates, which 
if adopted, will provide adequate revenue to operate and maintain the water and sewer 
system. 

The city’s liabilities total $117.6M. Some of the major components are: $55. 3M debt, 
including $20. 7M owed to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), 
$17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded other post-employment benefits (OPEB) 
liabilities. 

Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014. 

o Fifth Third Bank has finalized an agreement and settled for 50 cents on the dollar 
for outstanding debt. 

o By June 30, 2015, Highland Park, as required by terms of the emergency loan, 
must have a third-party operator for its water/sewer systems. 



Page 9 


o After the selection of this third-party operator, DWSD and Highland Park will 
negotiate a long-term settlement for outstanding water and sewer debt, 
o The city must reduce retiree healthcare benefit costs. 

o In August 2015, an emergency loan of $16.4M, which includes the restructuring 
of $4.8M in existing loans, will be used to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization 
Bonds, $5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund 
Bonds. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 
Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

In December 2014, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of retirees 
who receive a 13 th check to offset inflation. The county is required to return $32M to the 
Pension Equity Fund. 

A Financial and Operating Plan and a voluntary Consent Agreement are being drafted. 
Significant Actions/Issues 

Cash reserves reached its lowest point in August 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $73M. The average balance is $170M. This number includes proceeds 
from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

A letter to the Treasurer from previous County Executive Robert Ficano, indicates that 
with the significant transfer of revenue from the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund 
(DTRF), the General Fund deficit will be reduced to approximately $50M for FY 2014. 

In the same letter, it is indicated that the County has budgeted a transfer of $64M from 
the DTRF to balance the General Fund in FY 2015. However, this represents the last of 
the DTRF’s unrestricted equity. This will result in a potential budget gap of $20M in FY 
2016. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M. This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures. The Plan participants are now paying a larger share of the cost. This does not 
include any saving opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 
The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority.

DRAFT 



April 29, 2015 


Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
1 1 1 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, MI 48909 


Dear Governor Snyder: 

Tlic City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 2011. Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and I feel that 
the financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position 
as Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you arc aware. I was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of PA 
436 of 20 1 2. I am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint; my predecessors were Michael K. Brown (PA 
4 and PA 436). Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major 
steps toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and 
financial best practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and 
levels of service provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, 
characterized by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and 
unsustainable legacy costs. At the conclusion of FY12, the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager 
was appointed, the City's General Fund deficit stood at $19.1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8.8 
million; and cash flow was $13 million, or less than one month's expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities 
were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street 
lighting; waste collection was changed to a fee for service from a millage rate; and increases in utility 
rates to among the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public 
safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrunk by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

* The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now- 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General 
Fund deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan 
Board. City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

® New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have 
been enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the 


1 



requirement for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and 
maintenance of a biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund 
balance reserve, including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a 
requirement to begin funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City's purchasing 
ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long tenu liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over 
daily activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City 
operations have been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no 
longer being done internally, 91 1 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1. 
2015, and the City-funded 68‘ District Court is expected to become part of the Count} - funded 
67 ,l: District Court in January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the 
Karegondi Water Authority instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective 
bargaining contracts have also been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the 
stage for permanent reductions in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the 
level of parks maintenance. Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, 
with reduced assistance from the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to pm ate 
operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long tenu stabilization and future development. A new 
Master Plan (the first since the 1960's) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has 
been completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new 
zoning ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces 
significantly engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the 
Flint City Council, w ith the support of the Mayor. 

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current 
Charter and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which 
will be elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current 
Strong Mayor form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 


Continuing Challenges: 

Significant w ork has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work 
on the part of the City leaders: 


2 



« Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit 
over its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is 
currently operating under a judge’s order which allows modification of the City's historical level 
of health care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 

® The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a 
long term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently 
provides is not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, 
stud)-, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that arc among the highest in the state. 
Hus is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot ev en be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee Count) in the creation of the K.WA w ill 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 v oters 
approv ed a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint's total level to within I mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This millage, plus one for 2 mills approv ed some time ago. are 
expiring in 2017. and w ithout renewal, the resulting level of public safety serv ices, even with the 
current lev el of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This w as recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 100 more officers on the street than Flint does. 

• Equally important to providing State support in the form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City's lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City's 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 


Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of PA 436 of 2012. the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act. provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
infonn you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, I am prepared to say that I 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 21(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved, I recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. I believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to full local control . 


3 



The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 

If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to 
the historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of 
City leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of sen ice to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 


Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City' of Flint

Emergency and allocate responsibilities in the event of the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board: 


1 



1. The purpose of PA 436, which became effective on March 28, 2013, is to safeguard and 
ensure the financial accountability of local units of government; to preserve the capacity of 
local units of government to provide or cause to be provided necessary' services essential to 
the public health, safety, and welfare; to provide for review, management, planning, and 
control of the financial operation of local units of government and the provision of sendees 
by local units of government; to authorize a declaration of the existence of a financial 
emergency within local units of government; to prescribe remedial measures to address a 
financial emergency within local units of government; to provide for the appointment and to 
prescribe the powers and duties of emergency managers for local units of government; and to 
provide for the termination of a financial emergency within a local unit of government. 

2. Section 23 of PA 436 authorizes the Governor, before removing a local government from 
receivership, to appoint a Receivership Transition Advisory Board (Board) to monitor the 
affairs of the local government until the receivership is terminated. 

3. By letter dated April 29, 2015, I recommended that Governor Snyder appoint a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board for the City. 

4. In the event that the Governor appoints a Receivership Transition Advisory Board (Board), 
this Order is issued to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the City for the 
duration of the period that the Board is monitoring the affairs of the City and the City 
remains in receivership. City officials shall be governed by and perform the duties and 
functions set forth as follows: 

(a) The Mayor and City Council shall implement all of the following financial best 
practices within the City and do all of the following: 

1) Safeguard the financial stability of the City by seeking out, approving, and 
implementing cost-saving measures recommended by the City Administrator, 
the Board, or both. 

2) Work with the City Administrator and other City or State officials to 
successfully transition the City from receivership and eliminate financial 
stress within the City. 

3) Ensure that the City makes annually required contributions to the City’s 
pension funds. Any changes to the City’s pension plans, including an annual

adoption or subsequent amendment must be submitted for Board approval 
prior to implementation. The City shall comply with the two-year budget, 
which the Emergency Manager adopted pursuant to §21(1) of PA 436; 
however the two-year budget may be amended by approval of the Board and 
State Treasurer. Proposed budget amendments must be submitted to the Board 
at the next Board meeting that follows the event or discovery that necessitates 
the amendment.

complete reappraisal of all property within all property classes within the City, 
to be implemented for the 2018 Assessment Roll. The City must maintain 
adequate assessment records in compliance with State Statute, State Tax 
Commission Rules and State Tax Commission Guidelines. 

17) Review and recommend approval of all asset sales to the Board. Absent Board 
approval to do otherwise, the net proceeds from all asset sales shall be 
deposited in the City’s pension funds, if at the time of the asset sale the City’s 
pension funds are not fully funded. Additionally, City owned parcels shall be 
appraised prior to sale and sold by a sealed bid process absent approval by the 
Board to sell by another method. 

18) Review election precinct sites and approve expenses associated with elections, 
consistent with the budget then in effect for the City.

Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points 
September 24, 2015 

• Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority - a priority that includes 
ensuring clean, safe drinking water for all residents and especially children. 

• The results of the Hurley Children's Hospital are under review by the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human Services. 

• The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data 
regarding blood lead levels in Flint. 

® MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results of the Hurley study to see how 
they achieved their results. 

MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint 

• MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010, years before the 
change in Flint's water source occurred in April 2014. 

• Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months, 
the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010. 

• If elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water, we would expect 
to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source, rather than 
follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months. 

• All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to 
MDHHS, in accordance with State Law. 

Differences in Analysis 

• MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the 
Flint area, and specifically, accounts for data over the full course of the past five years. 

® Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the 
seasonal trends of lead in the area. 

• Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children 
playing outside in the soil, and when windows are open and lead paint is more likely to 
be in the air. This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system. 

® Our data includes children from the entire city, including all medical facilities, rather 
than just Hurley, has a larger age group of children, and includes a much larger sample 
size. 

• The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each 
child, which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred. 



• The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size, much more limited time period (January- 
September of 2013 and 2015 only), and a smaller age group of children. 


WIC Children 

• In homes with infants on WIC, if the household has documentation from an official 

source of unsanitary water supply issues, that family may be eligible to receive ready-to- 
feed formula. Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible. 

® Each household would have to be looked at on an individual basis. 

® WIC cannot cover bottled water. 




Frequently Asked Questions: 
Water Lead Levels in the City of Flint 
September 2015 


How can lead get into drinking water? 

Lead detections in Flint drinking water exist at the home level. Sampling at the Flint 
Water Treatment Plant has shown no lead in its treated water. However, this 
contaminant leaches into water from a home’s lead service lines, lead solder, and 
leaded plumbing materials including fixtures, faucets, and fittings. 

Does the city meet federal drinking water standards for lead and copper? 

Yes, the city is meeting state and federal guidelines for lead and copper. 

The City of Flint has regularly monitored for lead and copper since federal law began 
requiring it in 1991 . 

When the City changed water sources in May 2014, state and federal law required the 
city to sample for lead and copper for a full year to determine how the water may be 
interacting with residential lead plumbing to increase lead levels. While the city’s results 
show residential lead levels below the federal threshold for immediate response 
activities, Flint is moving quickly to optimize corrosion control measures in its water 
system. 

Some individual homes showed high numbers for lead. Isn’t that a concern? 

For the homeowner, yes it is. There is no “safe" level for lead, and while the leading 
cause of lead poisoning around the country is lead paint, any source of lead ingestion is 
worthy of concern. 

But the State and federal guidelines for lead and copper acknowledge an important 
reality: Any home that has a lead service connection or lead plumbing will impart some 
varying amount of lead into the home’s water. The only way to eliminate lead in a home 
water system is to remove lead plumbing or replace lead service connections to the city 
system. 

The lead and copper rule requires the local operator to sample dozens, sometimes 
hundreds of homes in the service area to get a general sense of how the water supply is 
interacting with lead plumbing and service connections. The tests are done specifically 
at homes with lead service connections. Individual results vary and all participants are 


1 


Are there other ways the city monitors for lead exposure? 

The County Health Department, overseen statewide by the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout 
Michigan communities. The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint. 

Blood lead level testing results for the 12-month period just after the City of Flint 
changed its water source (May 2014 - April 2015) showed no significant change in the 
pattern of blood lead levels in Flint, compared to the previous three years. This data 
suggests the recent change in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an 
increase in lead exposure throughout the community. 

How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem? 

Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90 th percentile calculation. If more 
than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per 
billion, a water supply has an “action level exceedance.” An exceedance is not a 
violation. It triggers other requirements which could include public notification, additional 
water quality sampling, and possibly further treatment. 

While some of Flint’s individual samples exceeded the 15 parts-per-billion lead action 
level, compliance is based on the 90 th percentile of samples. The City of Flint’s 90 th 
percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion in 2008 and 201 1 , and 15 parts 
per billion in 1992, but never exceeded the action level. 

The two most recent sampling periods, in 2014 and 2015, were 6 parts per billion and 
1 1 parts per billion, respectively. 

Did the city use every sample they got back? 

Sampling requirements for lead and copper are designed to target the most common 
pathways to lead ingestion in homes with the least protection. The sample must be 
collected from a commonly used kitchen or bathroom tap, and in accordance with the 
provided sampling instructions. Homes that employ filtration or additional treatment 
cannot be included. Samples must also be collected within the established monitoring 
period. 

1 have a lead service connection or lead plumbing. What should I do? 

Replacement is the only way to eliminate lead exposure. However, here are some 
interim steps homeowners can take to reduce it: 

Flush pipes before drinking, and only use cold water for consumption. 

The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may 
contain. When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer, 
"flush" cold-water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get. This 
could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home, 
such as showering or flushing toilets. Otherwise, it could take two minutes or longer. 

Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking, and especially for making 
baby formula. Hot water is likely to contain higher levels of lead. 


2 



Who is responsible for replacement of leaded materials? 

Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials 
within the home is a homeowner’s responsibility The City of Flint owns the service 
pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve, and that is the City’s responsibility 
This valve is normally located two feet in from the street curb. From there to the house 
is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner. 

Why doesn’t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines? 

Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make 
the situation worse. Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated 
effective in achieving long-term reductions in drinking water lead levels. 

What is the City’s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment? 

The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal 
corrosion control treatment and follow-up monitoring to take up to five years. 

However, the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized 
Corrosion Control Treatment in less than six months. 

What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year? 

The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior 
to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). The water provided by 
KWA will come from a new source, Lake Huron. The city will continue its lead and 
copper sampling every six months. Additionally, the city’s water treatment plant will 
continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment. 

How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint? 

The city has about 32,900 service connections in total. More than 15,000 of these 
connections are considered lead service lines. Even if many crews were contracted, it 
would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work. 

What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house? 

Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from $2,000 to 
$8,000. Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed, as 
well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered. 

With more than 15,000 lead service lines at an estimated average cost of $4,000 for 
each replacement, total cost could be $60 million or more.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces formation of Flint Water 
After Action Report Commission 

Experts will provide ongoing monitoring of city water system 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced a new task force to review the 
state’s actions regarding water usage and testing in Flint. The commission will conduct 
a thorough review and lay out recommendations on future guidelines for water testing. It 
will also monitor the transition of Flint’s city water system back to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority, and its eventual transition to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline. 

The commission will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and 
Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew 
Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, and Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. 

“As stated previously, transitioning back to the Great Lakes Water Authority is a good 
first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder said. 
“Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
technical issues will be key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and 
ensuring safe drinking water for all the citizens of Flint.” 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he 
specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, 
Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as 
Senate Majority Leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at 
Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 
70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the 
MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served eight 
years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the MEC for eight years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is Professor of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and Professor of Public Policy at the Gerald R. 
Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. He is the 
founding Director of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health 
and the National Voices Project. Dr. Davis also previously served as the Chief Medical 
Executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health and 
Human Services. 



Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi 
Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great 
Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate 
consultant and municipal advisor for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and 
issuance of $1 .7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City 
of Atlanta’s Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of 
experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making 
assessments. 

As Gov. Snyder previously stated, reconnecting with the authority will not completely 
resolve the city’s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time 
for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps 
outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use 
of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to 
eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality is 
continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for 
Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Attached is a draft press release to be reviewed with the after action team tomorrow morning. 


In addition, Rich & Harvey are vetting & reaching out to two potential Flint residents to join the task force: 


1) Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, MD of Mott Children's Hospital, long standing and respected member of the Flint 
community, speaks his mind and very professional. 


2) Dr. Clarence Philips, MD of the Hamilton Health Center that serves the indigent population in 
Flint. Again, long standing and respected member of the Flint community, speaks his mind and very 
professional. 


Depending on which one is selected, Rich will invite them to the meeting tomorrow by phone or in person. 


Attached are resumes for Kolb, Dr. Davis, and Eric Rothstein. 


Draft Agenda: 


1) Introductions 

2) Mission of Task Force 

3) Background Info 





4) Discussion of Timeline 


5) Q & A from Task Force Members 

6) Communications Strategy/Review Press Release 


Suggested Goals for Task Force: 


1) Thorough review of all steps taken in Flint regarding switch to Flint River and back GLWA. 

a. Create Timeline of actions 

b. Establish why each action was taken 

2) Review of role of Feds, EM, State, City Council, and Mayor in process. 

a. Establish best practices for Feds, State, Local, and EM to work together in future situations 
b Indicate where coordination could have been and should be improved 

3) Review of DEQ & DHHS actions & protocols 

a. Did DEQ & DHHS follow the proper procedures? 

b. Do the procedures need to change? 

4) Provide guidance for switch back to GWLA 

a. Ensure proper corrosion controls & testing is in place 

b. Highlight steps for eventual switch to Karegnondi 

5) Testing Beyond Flint 

a. What practices need to change in communities outside of Flint? 

b. What change in law is recommended to ensure all Michiganders are drinking clean water? 


Suggested Timeline: 


The task force members have indicated that 2 months is the earliest possible time to properly conduct a full after action 
report. In reality, they suggest 3 months is more feasible. Given the holidays, a 2 month timeline puts us roughly right 
around Christmas. I would suggest we set a 3 month goal. 


Oct 21: After Action Team Announced

Selected Key Project Experience 

For the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division Eric Rothstein has served 
as an independent utility advisor for mediation related to the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority 
(GLWA). Following execution of a Memorandum of Understanding and Articles of Incorporation by the 
Incorporating Municipalities (City of Detroit, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties, and the State of Michigan), 
Mr. Rothstein was appointed to serve as Implementation Planning Program Manager for the standup of the 
GLWA - a regional utility serving approximately 40% of the population of the State of Michigan. 

For Water Replenishment District of Southern California, Eric Rothstein was engaged to provide an expert 
report related to the consistency of the District’s rate setting requirements with industry-standard practices 
contemplating proportionate distribution of cost responsibilities based on cost causation. These practices are 
consistent with prescripts of State of California law. 

For Jefferson County, Alabama, Eric Rothstein has served as the County’s rate consultant since 2010. He 
has reviewed cost-of service analyses and alternative rate proposals to address the County’s outstanding sewer 
warrant obligations, developed revisions to its sewer rates approved in November 2012, and again in 
September 2013, and is leading strategic financial planning related to the County's bankruptcy Plan of 
Adjustment. Mr. Rothstein has been deposed and provided expert witness testimony in various court 
proceedings stemming from the County’s declaration of bankruptcy in 2011, and has led development of a 
Municipal Advisor Report related to a planned Series 2013 Sewer Warrant issue to effectuate the County’s exit 
from bankruptcy. 

For the Halifax Regional Water Commission, Eric Rothstein led development of a Cost of Service and Rate 
Design report to the Nova Scotia Utility and Accounting Review Board (NSUARB Docket No. NSUARB-W- 



HRWC-R-11), in response to the Board’s Order and Decision to hold separate hearings to determine 
appropriate ratemaking methodologies for Canada’s first regulated water, wastewater and stormwater utility. 
Eric led preparation of the report and the development of cost allocation and rate design models to illustrate the 
implications of alternative methodological approaches. Eric supported development of HRWC’s subsequent 
application for water, wastewater and stormwater rates filed with the NSUARB in December 2012 and provided 
expert witness testimony in support thereof in April 2012. In April 2014, Eric prepared a HRWC Cost Shares for 
Use of the Angus L, Macdonald Bridge and provided expert witness testimony in M06127 - Halifax-Dartmouth 
Bridge Commission/Halifax Regional Water Commission: Waterline on the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge - HDBC- 
G-14 

For the City of Atlanta, since 2004, Mr. Rothstein has served as the Department of Watershed Management’s 
primary coordinator for its revenue bond issues used to finance its $3 billion wastewater Consent Decree 
program. This has included issues in 2004, 2008, 2009 (2), 2013 and 2015 and, in 2006, implementation of its 
Tax-Exempt Commercial Paper program with a shelf registration of $1.2 billion. Mr. Rothstein led development 
of the Department’s Financial Capability Based Schedule Extension Request Report used to secure the City’s 
13-year extension of its wastewater Consent Decree schedule. He prepared each of the Department’s Financial 
Capability Assessment filings. He has led the development and updating of strategic financial planning tools for 
water and sewer rate development and policy-level consideration of overall program financing strategies (as 
well as detailed project expenditure, status, and schedule tracking). 

For the Egyptian Ministry of Housing, through a USAID contract, Mr. Rothstein developed guidance on tariff 
setting, capital project prioritization, and strategic planning for the newly established water and wastewater 
sector regulatory agency. The project involved the development of a guidance manual, detailed financial 
planning and cost-of-service analysis modeling, and testing of financial analysis and prioritization tools with four 
major Egyptian utilities. Mr. Rothstein has also provided presentations on financial planning and strategic 
planning principles to USAID staff and Technical Assistance contractors. 

For the Milwaukee Wholesale Customers, through sub-contracts with SHEH, Inc., Mr. Rothstein reviewed the 
Milwaukee Water Works rate increase applications filed in 2010 and 2014, reviewed pre-filed testimony, and 
offered expert witness testimony related to revenue requirements and appropriate rates of return at hearings 
before the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. 

For several wastewater permittees facing Consent Decrees including the City of Akron, East Bay Municipal 
Utility District, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, Metropolitan Sewer District of St. Louis, and the 
City and County of Honolulu, Mr, Rothstein has assisted in the conduct of financial capability assessments 
per EPA prescribed methodologies and in the development of alternative approaches to assessment that more 
appropriately reflect utility capital financing options, These efforts have been used in the formulation of 
negotiation positions related to the scope and schedule of potential Consent Decree provisions. Mr. Rothstein 
is currently engaged with the City of Peoria, IL and with the Guam Waterworks Authority, in similar Consent 
Decree negotiations. 

For the National Association of Clean-Water Agencies, Mr. Rothstein has served as Principal Author for the 
development of several of the association’s white papers and publications related to Financial Capability 
Assessments used to develop wastewater Consent Decree schedules, These publications include NACWA’s 
Financial Capability and Affordability in Wet Weather Negotiations (2007), and The Evolving Landscape for 
Financial Capability Assessment: Clean Water Act Negotiations and the Opportunities of Integrated Planning 
(2013). These papers provide critical reviews of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) 
established policies and guidance on financial capability assessments for wet weather programs and offers 
practical guidance for negotiations on enforcement policies and practices related to consideration of financial 
capability. 



For the City of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Mr. Rothstein served as Project Manager for a comprehensive cost-of- 
service rate studies for the City’s water, wastewater and stormwater systems conducted in 1997 and 2012. in 
1997, the consulting team facilitated decision-making through an extensive public involvement process that 
featured monthly meetings of a Citizen’s Advisory Committee comprised of a diverse set of stakeholder 
representatives. For both studies, detailed cost allocation analyses were conducted and customized computer 
rate analysis models developed to facilitate rate updating for budgetary changes, revision to cost allocations, 
and rate design modifications. 

For Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia, Mr. Rothstein has provided strategic financial planning, bond 
feasibility and comprehensive cost-of-service rate assistance since 2000, Strategic financial planning facilitated 
the City’s adoption of a seven-year, 11 percent per annum rate increase schedule to support infrastructure re- 
investment in excess of $400 million, Mr. Rothstein managed 3 bond feasibility studies over the course of the 
program implementation, helping the County to secure strong credit ratings and favorable financing. A cost-of- 
service study in 2004 involved special queries of a new billing system for development of user characteristic 
data and consideration of specific cost assignments for previously unsewered portions of the County’s 
wastewater system. 

Previous to his work as a utility management consultant, Mr. Rothstein served in several financial management 
positions for the City of Austin, Texas, In this capacity, he directed staffs of up to 22 members in utility 
ratemaking, evaluation of regionalization alternatives and proposed utility investments, analysis of capital 
financing options, internal control evaluation, and revenue forecasting.

Sara, there are only two questions for tomorrow's interview: 

Question 1: Please tell us about the DPS legislation that is being proposed and how it will help better educate the Detroit 
Students. 

Question 2: How are you going to fix Flint's water system problems and how will you keep a situation like this from 
happening again. 

Please note, I am not going after the "why" of Flint. I just want to hear the solution.

Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Key Actions : 

On December 28-29, 2015, staff from the DEQ and DLARA conducted the formal 
plumbing evaluation of Flint Community Schools’ Northwestern High School and 
Southwestern Classical Academy. On December 29-30 staff from DEQ and DLARA 
then performed the follow-up sampling of the drinking fountains and faucets that are 
used for consumptive purposes at these two facilities. This completes the initial 
evaluation process for all 13 schools of the Flint Community Schools. Once the Flint 
Community Schools has had an opportunity to incorporate the recommendations in the 
plumbing evaluation reports, a follow-up sampling will be scheduled to ensure that all of 
the issues have been properly addressed. 

Evaluations of the Flint Community Schools will continue to be posted to the Flint water 
Web site: www.mi.gov/flintwater . These reports are being shared with Flint Community 
Schools Superintendent Bilal Tawwab first and then posted. So far, three reports have 
been posted, with the remaining reports expected to be completed by the end of 
January 2016. 

A list of schools and childcare facilities served by the Flint water system requesting a 
plumbing evaluation has been created. These facilities will be contacted during the first 
two weeks in January to schedule a free plumbing evaluation of their facilities. The 
protocol used will be the same one used for the Flint Community Schools. To date, 
there are a total of 10 facilities that have requested a plumbing evaluation. Once these 
10 facilities have been scheduled, efforts will be made to reach out to additional facilities 
that may wish to take advantage of this free program. 

Video footage was taken on December 29, 2015, of the plumbing evaluation process 
and the sampling protocol of the drinking fountains and faucets at Flint Community 
Schools’ Northwestern H igh School and Southwestern Classical Academy. This 
footage is being used to create a video that provides an easy-to-understand explanation 
of how the plumbing evaluations and subsequent sampling is being done in the schools. 
The target audience for this video is primarily the residents of Flint so that they can get 
a visual of the efforts already underway, but it is anticipated that this video will also be 
used as an instructional aid for schools elsewhere in Michigan that are interested in 
having their facilities evaluated. 

Positions : 

There are no new positions to report. 

Concerns: 


There are no new concerns to report. 


FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 2 


Significant Event : 

On December 29, 201 5, Dan Wyant resigned his position as Director of the DEQ. DNR 
Director Keith Creagh has been appointed Interim Director of the DEQ. Reports have 
been created and meetings have been scheduled to provide Director Creagh with a 
history of the Flint situation as well as current plans for moving forward. 

Changes from Previous Report : 

® The Flint water Web site has been redesigned. The old site was beginning to 
become cluttered and information was becoming difficult to locate. The new 
design provides a more user friendly interface and has a more elegant flow. It is 
anticipated that the redesigned Web site will go live during the week of January 4, 
2016. 

• The DEQ Laboratory identified a lead result as being alarmingly high. This result 
was conveyed to Flint Action Plan Coordinator George Krisztian so that the 
customer could be contacted instead of waiting for the final report to go out. 
Investigation of the address revealed that the sample was taken at the Whaley 
Children’s Center. The facility was contacted, and the contact there was notified 
that one of the samples that they submitted was in excess of 2,500 parts per 
billion (ppb), or more than 160 times higher than the federally-mandated action 
level of 1 5 ppb. The contact was instructed to take measures to ensure that 
water from that point was not being used for consumptive purposes. Since the 
facility provided childcare, Mr. Krisztian described the free plumbing evaluation 
service available and offered to put Whaley Children’s Center on the list of 
facilities being evaluated. The contact indicated that they would provide the 
information to management for consideration. 

® A review of the results from the free lead testing offered to all Flint residents 
since November 1, 2015, show a downward trend compared to results from 
those prior to November 1 , 201 5. This can be attributed to a number of factors. 
The switch to using water from Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, the 
implementation of supplemental phosphate addition, and the colder temperatures 
are all possible contributing factors in this trend. 

Since November 1, 2015, a total of 298 samples have been submitted and 
analyzed by the DEQ Laboratory. Of these samples, 248 or 83.2% show 
concentrations of 5 ppb or less. In addition, 279 samples or 93.6% show 
concentrations at or below the action level of 15 ppb. 

While this data is encouraging and indicates that the Flint water supply is moving 
towards compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), it is imperative to 
view this data cautiously. The LCR specifies what sampling points may be used 
for compliance purposes. The data for these samples is nonselective and 



FOIA EXEMPT AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
Flint Drinking Water Action Plan Update 
Page 3 


potentially may not be coming from distribution points that would be allowed 
under the LCR. In addition, although the paperwork indicates that samples 
should not go through a filter, it is possible that some residents are using the free 
lead testing service to ensure the filters that have been provided do, in fact, 
remove lead. 

Other item : 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing data for samples submitted by Flint residents 
through the free lead testing program.

Subject: Confidential and Time Sensitive-Surprise for Dennis Muchmore 


Team: 


As you know, our unflappable and erudite Chief of Staff, Dennis Muchmore will be bidding us farewell next month after 
the State of the State address. We commissioned our very own craftsman, Jim Redford to construct a suitable farewell 
gift for the man who has everything (see attached picture). The Ml chairs and table are being temporarily stored in a 
room on the 3rd floor, Southeast corner, of Romney. We would like each of you to come by between now and COB on 
Friday December 18th and sign your name. There won't be enough room for messages except for those penned by the 
Governor and Lieutenant Governor, so take comfort in knowing that if your name is on the furniture, you will have 
lasting proof that you worked with Dennis even if you do something in the future to tick him off and he claims to never 
having known you... 


The furniture will only be there until December 18th because Jim needs to apply several coats of varnish and let 
everything properly set before we present the set to Dennis on January 21st. Please call Virginia Manolakoudis at 517- 
241-5621 if you need access to the 3rd floor storage area. 


Regards, 


Rich

Flint/Detroit 

RB reported that the Flint Water Advisory Board (ask Rich for the names if he wants them included) has 
been chosen and will provide an independent review of the water situation to determine what got us 
there in the first place and what can we learn from it so it doesn't happen again. The Board is working 
well together. Flint blames the State for the water situation and is a hot box right now.

Pat: 


Mike and i discussed the way forward and he had various conversations with PwC, Bernard and the steering group. I 
also spoke with Bernard last week, ! suggest that you and he and ! have a discussion about where we are, I will ask 
Virginia to arrange it, I brought you and Bernard into this mix because ! think there is value in reconciling both 
approaches. I think that having consistency of language, look and fee! at the top of each agency strategy and with the 
Governor's Strategic Objectives is optimal. I do not think we need millions in consulting fees to get there and I want 
John's involvement in the departmental "what" and you driving the departmental "how". 


Thanks— Virginia, over to you.

Gents, 


It has occurred to me for some time that perhaps, rather than DOC, our next Agencies might be DEQ followed by DNR. If 
they can't test water, who knows what else is lurking in the weeds? ! suspect your report back on DEQ might have 
indicated as much. 


I also trust by now that PwC has been told that Bernard's project is coming to an end. Will that make them a bit more 
receptive to my win/win, or are they going to keep pushing Bernard? Speaking of which, we need a little organization to 



the M DARD pilot program. 1 suggested it to cause PwC/Bernard to put their cards on the table. Just what is it exactly 
they propose and how will it produce a more cost effective result than OpEx? Whatever it is, they should be obligated 
to put it on paper. 


Now, I suggest that we have a meeting to get the rules straight, it might be appropriate for Mike to chair it. I assume he 
is the point guy on resolution. It will also keep PwC honest. I don't want to waste all this knowledge Mike is acquiring. 


Finally, I would be interested in what Jamie, Gordon, and Ken think about this. At the last Bernard meeting, I asked each 
of them to consider where we would have been had we followed the Bernard methodology all the way into MDARD 
compared with where we are now. Without hesitation, they all responded separately that it would have been the same 
place. I rest my case. 


it would be interesting to ask Nick/Sally and David/Brom the same question. Something tells me I know the answer. 


Finally, if Bernard's project is going to yield real results, it needs to provide the Agency level objectives that the plan 
envisions. I suspect Bernard will avoid that arguing that it can't be done until the Agencies are "mapped." Again, our 
results indicate that such is not the case. If he does not do so, then we will do it as part of OpEx. As I noted, that is what 
we are doing now. DEG. is responsible for protecting us and the environment. That is their objective. How they do it to 
a much enhanced level of consistent excellence is what OpEx is all about. No mystery. 


I'll be in Lansing next week from about 4 on Monday through Thursday. Friday will find me at GRHV. Mike, perhaps we 
could find time for a quick chat. 


Happy New Year. I am looking forward to a very productive year. You have great people. They are fired up and really 
contributing. This is all about building momentum. We must keep them focused, let them understand what we are 
doing and let them begin to experience victory. That is what is now happening. It can only build. However, we must 
protect or credibility as the naysayers will quickly point to any breach.

MIRS BREAKING NEWS: Wyant Resigns As SV1DEG Director - 3:09 PM 

http://wvvw.nnirsnews.com/aiett.pho73iert id-2154 


Dan WYANT, the director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), is resigning in the 
wake of criticism about how the state handled elevated lead levels in Flint drinking water. 

Gov. Rick SNYDER announced Wyant's resignation in a statement today. Also, in the statement, the 
Governor said his administration would invite scientists who have been tracking the situation “to be our 
partners in helping us improve Flint water.” 

“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened,” Snyder's statement added. 
“And I want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only 
city that has an aging infrastructure.” 


On Wyant, Snyder said Wyant offered his resignation, “and I've determined that it's appropriate to accept it. 








“I'm also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force,” Snyder's 
statement said. 

Those other changes haven't been finalized yet, according to Laura BIEHL, a spokesperson for the 
Governor. 

The news of Wyant's resignation comes as a task force continues to work on a report about the Flint water 
crisis, which occurred after the city's water source was switched to the Flint River in 2014. 

“Although the task force's final report is not yet completed, members have made me aware of some interim 
findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the 
state keeps its citizens safe and informed,” Snyder said today. He continued, “We'll continue to work with 
the community members to make sure we hear and respond to their concerns.” 

Snyder also noted the he called Flint Mayor Karen WEAVER last week and the two are going to meet soon 
to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance. 

Wyant has been MDEQ director since Snyder took office in 201 1 . 

Previously, Wyant was the director of the Department of Agriculture under former Govs. John ENGLER and 
Jennifer GRANHOLM

Gov. Rick Snyder signs bill authorizing funding for Flint 
to move back to Detroit water system 

Temporary reconnection provides best protection for public health 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder has signed bipartisan legislation that will direct 
funding to the City of Flint’s emergency water services to reconnect the city’s water 
supply to the Great Lakes Water Authority until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline 
is completed. 

“This funding is a coordinated response to a serious problem and I’m pleased so many 
parties came together to help deliver safe drinking water to the city of Flint,” Snyder 
said. “Reconnecting to the Great Lakes Water Authority is only the first step, as the 
state will continue testing and inspections to ensure Flint families and children have 
clean water in their homes and schools." 

House Bill 4102, sponsored by state Rep. Al Pscholka, authorizes $6 million to move 
the city back to Detroit’s water system until the new pipeline is finished. 

In addition to the $6 million: 

o $300,000 goes to the Department of Environmental Quality’s drinking water and 
environmental health services; 

o $1 million will provide for DEQ to test water samples throughout the reconnection 
process; 

o $1 million allows the Department of Health and Human Services to purchase and 
distribute water filters to Flint residents; 

o $850,000 will aid in follow-up services for children, including lead testing and 
care for those with abnormal levels; 

o $200,000 will fund state plumbing inspections for schools and health facilities, 
o The City of Flint city government will provide $2 million toward reconnecting the 
water supply and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has committed $4 million. 

The bill was approved unanimously in both the House and Senate and is now Public Act 
143 of 2015.

Honorable Rick Snyder, Governor 
State of Michigan 

Dear Gov. Snyder, 

I'm writing to voice my displeasure with the lack of communication between your office and mine concerning the water 
crisis in the city of Flint. 

Since I have been in a position to represent my community at the Capitol, I have been in constant contact with your 
office to offer advice, help, partnership and solutions. My community elected me to represent them in Lansing, and i 
have been striving to do just that. Several letters have reached your office, and I have been highly vocal about the need 
to come together to fix the water crisis. This has been done with the understanding that we both care about the people 
of Flint, who I represent in the Legislature, and who you represent as governor of this state. 

I have also reached out to Dr, Eden Weils and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental Quality to be proactive in addressing the issue of lead-laced water damaging the minds 
and bodies of Flint's citizens, especially the children. While this crisis could be solved by switching water sources, the 
problems will remain in the health of our future generation. 

I had hoped that this entire problem would have been addressed through partnership, teamwork and cooperation. It is 
unfortunate that hasn't been the case. It is also unfortunate that common courtesy to my office on being kept up to 
speed with any operational changes and financial solutions has not been timely communicated. 

1 will continue to keep the lines of communication open as we address the continued problem of health in Flint, and I 
hope you will take the opportunity to join me in conversation to find future solutions.

FW: NEWS UPDATE-Wyant Resigns In Wake Of Flint Water Crisis 


Dave 

Smart way to handle this. The Miiliken administration had a similar problem. PBB, a fire retardant got mixed in with 
cattle feed and cows got very sick. Folks didn't know what was happening and once they discovered the problem a 
question of human health was raised. A major environmental and political problem. Milliken's Ag Director was slow and 
had some internal documents he didn't share. They had to buy the cattle - thousands - and dispose of them. I may 
have some of my recall a bit fuzzy at this hour of the morning, but it was a similar problem - government action or 
inaction and the response. You just have to move forward and be proactive in the decision making. Governors as 
leaders have to provide the leadership. 


I mentioned to a friend this week when we were discussing this Flint issue that 1 had recalled the PBB issue of the 
Miiliken administration and the quicker the Governor acts the better. 

Hope you and the family had a nice Christmas and wishing you the best for the New Year.

Wyant Resigns In Wake Of Flint Water Crisis 

Department of Environmental Quality Director Dan Wyant has resigned in response to the water crisis that 
erupted three months ago in Flint. 

“MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I’ve determined that it’s appropriate to accept it. 
I’m also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force,” Governor Rick 
Snyder said in a statement. 

“But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the 
scientific community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Flealth 
and Human Services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping 
us improve Flint water,” Mr. Snyder said. “Let’s share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can 
arrive at accurate and mutually supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we’re using the 
very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe drinking water and that we’re taking steps to 
protect their health over the short and long term.” 

The DEQ has come under major criticism for how it handled testing for lead in Flint drinking water after the 
city switched to the Flint River as its water source. The water was not properly treated for corrosion, causing 
lead to leach from service lines into the drinking water. 

“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry' I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan 
citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging 
infrastructure,” Mr. Snyder said. “I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That’s 
why I’m taking the actions today to ensure a culture of openness and tiust. We’ve already allocated $10 million 
to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, 
and we’re going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance.” 

Gongwer News Service will have more on this story in today’s Michigan Report.

Hey, Dan! 

Hope you're going well; Merry Christmas! 

This showed up on my Facebook page, from some good friends who happen to be wild left-wing Democrats... It's 
allegedly from a Colorado paper. Is it for real?? 

Here's the content... 

" Jesper Nymund 

December 24 at 3:01 am ■ Denver, CO • 

Breaking news: beleaguered Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has told his fellow Michiganders to "take a deep breath" and 
accept that the deliberate and sustained lead poisoning of the drinking water for the city of Flint was a "long term and 
structural investment" in the human infrastructure of the economically depressed and predominantly African American 
urban area. 

In an interview with Stuart Varney on Fox Business Network Governor Snyder explained that the brain damage and anti- 
social behaviors associated with early childhood lead poisoning would "pay dividends" further down the road. 

"My administration is very business friendly and incarceration for profit is one of those growth industries where we in the 
public sector can do the most good for our partners in the business community. It may take a decade or so before the 
toddlers sustaining brain damage today can be tried as adults and sentenced to long and profitable prison terms. But just 
to let you know how committed I am to this speculation in lead poisoning, Stuart, I can assure you that my personal 
portfolio is heavily invested in the prison industry!" 

Asked by Stuart Varney if the brain damage inflicted on Michigan's African American population might lend "further 
credence" to political scientists like Charles Murray who have suggested that lower scores on intelligence tests by various 
ethnic groups might be genetically based Governor Snyder exhibited winsome modesty in declining to take credit. 

"I couldn't possibly claim to have influenced the science on the issue, Stuart. In all Republican administrations, including 
my own, it is simply assumed that African Americans are naturally inferior in all fields except pro sports and rap music. To 
the extent our little experiment with heavy metal -- if you'll permit me a moment of levity! -- has helped to accentuate the 
natural state of affairs I'll regard that as a fringe benefit."

That's it, Dan; I can't believe it's real -- but is it?? 


Please let me know, so I can (hopefully) correct the record with my friends. 


God bless --

Okay, Tom... on our last phone conversation, I was surprised to hear you defended Gov. Rick Snyder. 


I am very curious to hear your response to this special report by Rachel Maddow that just aired tonight. I first heard 
about the poisonous Flint city water supply being switched to river water on Monday. When I heard it, I wondered to 
myself who was responsible for making such a disastrous decision to switch water supplies back in April. Surely 
accountability would surface. 


Well, good for Rachel... she did some first rate investigative journalism and aired this tonight. Please watch this entire 
report before responding. Its only 18 minutes long: 


Flint toxic water tragedy points directly to Michigan Gov. Snyder --> http://on.msnbc.com/lTVh8Ru 


I thank god I live in a progressive state like California. How did my home state fall into the hands of tin pot dictators like 
Snyder and his hand-picked apparatchiks? Snyder and his minions should go to jail for exposing Flint children to lead 
poisoning!

To the Office of the Governor, 


My position and recommendation on the Flint water issue is that the state should immediately switch Flint's water 
source back to the Detroit Water System at no additional cost to Flint residents and supply water filters to every 
household in Flint. Furthermore, the state should begin to estimate costs for the total damage done to the city's public 
works infrastructure and for the treatment of potential adverse health outcomes we could see in Flint residents in the 
future. 


If you would like to discuss this further, please contact my office at (517) 373-7515.

Importance: High 


Here is the letter from the Genesee Co Drain Commission, My interpretation of the contents would be their estimate 
$13, 2mm (vs the $12mm discussed this morning). 

They included their contract with the City, Sec 5.7 references prevailing rates the City would be charged; that is 
different than the rates reflected in the $13. 2mm. So that contract may need to be modified. 

They also raise some other items (under Procedure to Activate Supply - p.3) that may have cost implications.

MEMORANDUM 


DATE : October 7, 20 1 5 


TO; 


Wayne Workman, Deputy Director, Treasury 
Randall Byrne, State Administrative Manager 


FROM: John F. O'Brien, P.E., Director 

SUBJECT: Letter Dated September 30, 2015 
Wolfson to Henderson 


My staff and I have reviewed the letter referenced above and have prepared this quick 
memorandum to explain the economics concerns and ramifications of the temporary cessation of 
the Flint water treatment operations and the return to DWSD/GLWA supply. 

"This memorandum is broken down into three parts: economics, procedure and concerns. 


Prior to April 2014, Flint held a water contract with DWSD. Flint also had the franchise rights to 
DWSD water for Genesee County. Therefore, Genesee County received DWSD water via the 
Flint. The water rate was calculated on that joint demand. In 201 3-201 4, the allocated cost was 
$25,303,062 or $738,066 per month plus $1 3.01 per met 

In 2013, DWSD terminated the Flint contract effective April 2014. The Flint chose to go to the 
Flint River as its source water until KWA water was made available. With the contract 
terminated, the franchise was terminated and the county had to go to DWSD for water because 
Flint could no longer supply DWSD water and the Flint River and the Flint water treatment plant 
does not have the capacity to serve both utilities. 

DWSD established a new rate for GCDC that included significant non-contract and non-member 
charges to access the water. GCDC also acquired approximately 9 miles of water main pi pe 
from the Flint. (The Detroit water meter at the county line between Lapeer and Genesee and the 
Flint water plant is approximately 1 1 miles into the county.) The pipeline is of no use to Flint, 
under the Flint River supply or K WA supply scenario. As part of the purchase agreement, 
language was included for emergency reconnection for Flint to DWSD through this water line. 



GCDC water rates with DWSD are as follows: 

Fixed Monthly Commodity 

July 2013 - April 20 1 4 (Flint Contract) $346,863 $ 1 3.01 

May 2014 - June 2014 $423,400 $15.18 

July 2014 - June 2015 $1,149,400 $3.89 

July 201 5 Present $900,000 $ 1 1 .86 


As you can see, the fixed monthly fees and commodity fees have had significant swings. This is 
because under the Flint contract, only 40% of revenue was fixed. GCDC went to 80% and are 
now 60% for the current billing period. 

Upon reviewing DWSD’s letter of September 20 1 5, DWSD went back to the 2013-2014 rate, 
added 4% for FY 14-15 and added approximately 1 1 .3% for FY 15-16. This would create a 
water revenue requirement for a combined Flint/Genesee supply. In Section 1 d) of the letter, 
they state they would subtract GCDC current payments from that volume, leaving the amount to 
be paid by Flint. Remember, GCDC is paying the non-contract/non-customer penalty charges. 

The reported rate would be $662,100 monthly fixed and $8.93/mcf commodity. Based on 15 
million gallons a day and a 30 day month, the monthly charge would be: 

$662,100 + 1 5,000,000 gal x 30 days x 1 mcf / 7,480 gallons x $8.93 / mcf 

$662,100 + $537,232.62 = $1,199,332.62 per month 

Flint, over the last two seasons, has seen periods of water flow in the 20 to 25 mgd range due to 
water main breaks. This period has lasted 2 to 3 months. What is the additional cost if the 
monthly average was 21 mgd? 


6,000,000 x 30 / 7,480 x $8.93 / mcf - $214,893.04 per month 


The only way for DWSD to provide water to Flint is a common meter at the county line and flow 
through a county water main. As previously stated, the Flint and GCDC have a contract 
regarding this potential circumstance (see 5.7 attached). 

Assuming the fixed rate by DWSD is correct, the cost with the current, commodity would be: 

$662,100 + 1 5,000,000 x 30 / 7,480 x $11.86- $1 ,375,602.67 

And again, with water main breaks, the additional monthly cost would be $285,401 .00. 

Paragraph 1 d) of the DWSD letter recognizes this issue in the last sentence: “Depending on 
how water is provided to the combined GCDC/Flint customer, alternative rate structures may be 
appropriate.” 

We can back into that alternate rate basal on our knowledge of the DWSD rate structure. 

DWSD wants 60% of its revenue from fixed rate. 

Volume per month 
49,428 mcf 
50,590 mcf 
100,01 8 mcf 


GCDC fixed 
Flint fixed 
TOTAL 


$900,000 

$662,100 

$1,562,100 



Total commodity required is $1,041,400 

Rate based on volume $10,41 would be the alternative rate 


The adjusted rate for Flint would then be: 

50% of fixed rate plus $10.41 per mcf 

$781,050 + $15,000,000 + 30 / 7,480 x $10.41 - $1,407,320 

And again, at this rate, the water main break situation could, add $250,508 per month 

Therefore, Flint’s expected bill for DWSD supplied water for a nine month period with 2 months 

of high flow would be $13,166,896. 

Procedure to Activate Supply 

1 . Agreement with DWSD and common rate for joint GCDC/FKnt water supply would be 
required. Agreement needs to include separate billings to Flint and GCDC, Flint to pay 
directly to DWSD based on meter readings at Baxter and Potter and Station 2 on Flint plant 
site, GCDC makes no representation to the water quality - that is between Flint and 
DWSD. The agreement needs a termination transfer protocol for Flint exiting and GCDC 
remaining. 

2. Separate agreement with Flint: back up supply was anticipated on an emergency basis. 
Nine months to a year of sendee requires a more detailed agreement. Water outage due to 
line break and cost to repair, etc. The agreement needs a termination clause if Flint is still 
on DWSD when GCDC is ready to turn on its water treatment plant in the fell of 2017. 

3. The 72-inch line will be required to be reactivated. This will require flushing, pressure 
testing, and BAC-T sampling. 

4. Station 2 meter needs to be calibrated and GCDC will need access to control the valves and 
read the meters. 

5. Flint needs to reactivate the Dort Reservoir. 

6. Flint should perform a significant water flush of the distribution system just prior to the 
switch over. 


Flint Distribution System 


The TTHM and lead issues here arising due to the water quality at the residential tap: Everyone 
agrees that the water leaving the water plant is clean, clear, and lead-free. At the residential tap, 
it has been shown to contain lead, is often brown in color, and has an odor. These are all 
indications of problems In the distribution system. The distribution system was built for a 
population of 250,000 people and major industrial use. Current population is below 100,000 and 
there is limited industrial use. 

If Flint does not continue to make improvements/modifications to the distribution system, the 
problem at the residential tap will continue. 



Will the lead sampling protocols change based on Flint’s switch back to DWSD? 

What happens to water treatment plant personnel during this 9-month period? Will they he laid 
offer carried as an additional, expense? 

When Flint switches to KWA, will the staff be capable of treating the water or will the learning 
curve begin again? 


it is the understanding of GCDC that all of the current samples that have been compiled at the 
Flint Water Treatment Plant have all tested within EPA and MDEQ guidelines. The emergency 
appears to be in the distribution of the water, which includes lead service leads to several 
residences located throughout Flint and not in the treatment of the water. As the treated water 
leaving the Flint Water Treatment Plant is within EPA and MDEQ guidelines, GCDC is 
confused as to what the emergency is at this time or why Flint would need to purchase water 
from DWSD. The quality of the water leaving the Flint Water Treatment Plant is as safe to 
drink as the water that would he transmitted by DWSD to Flint. 


Given the facts as they have been provided to GCDC, if D WSD begins to supply Flint with water 
via GCDC, the elevated lead levels will not immediately disappear and Flint will be paying an 
additional, million dollars plus a month over what it is currently paying to provide the same clean 
potable water to its residents. Additionally, by Flint receiving water from DWSD via GCDC, 
Flint will not be performing corrosion control measures on the DWSD treated water. This is 
important because once Flint begins to treat the raw water provided by KWA, the lead issue may 
resurface and continue until the corrosion control measures that will need to be restarted take 
effect, which GCDC estimates may take up to eight (8) months to establish the necessary film to 
separate the distribution system from the supply water. 

The DWSD letter purposely pits Flint against Genesee County customers by offering a lower rate 
to Flint than is currently being offered to GCDC. And the delivery point is the same. 

These are our quick thoughts on the matter. As time progresses, we will have more time to 
understand the issues and most likely additional concerns will present themselves. 

Should you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact this office at your convenience.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015 


Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review 
state, federal and municipal actions, offer recommendations 

Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus 

on steps to protect residents 

LANSING, Mich. - Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory 
task force charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer 
recommendations for future guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 

Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and 
environmental protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of 
Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving 
will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the 
Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence Reynolds of Mott Children’s Health Center in Flint. 

“Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water 
Authority is a good first step to protecting public health in Flint, but it’s not the last step,” Snyder 
said. “Bringing in outside experts to evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on 
potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be key to continuing work on the 
comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents in Flint and all 
of Michigan.” 

Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an 
unbiased report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve 
practices to ensure all residents have access to safe, clean water. 

Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in 
public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both 
the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has 
also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 

Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 
environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb 
represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor 
City Council. He has been president of the MEC for six years. 

Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the 
University of Michigan Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford 
School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor 
of health management and policy at the School of Public Health. He previously served as the 
chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/Department of Health 
and Human Services. 



Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein 
Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water 
Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County, Alabama’s rate consultant and 
municipal adviser for litigation related to the county’s bankruptcy and issuance of $1.7 billion in 
sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of Atlanta’s Department of 
Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, wastewater and 
stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 

Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott 
Children’s Health Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of 
Medicine and has been in practice for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee 
County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He 
has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on behalf of children from the 
Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 

Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues 
and addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the city’s problem with 
lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with 
the phosphate corrosion control. 

To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined 
on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters 
and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The 
Michigan Departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing 
to provide free water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water 
customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking 
water.

Gov. Rick Snyder announces Flint Water Task Force to review state, federal 
and municipal actions, offer recommendations 


Experts in public health, water management, environmental protection to focus on steps to 

protect residents 


LANSING, Mich. Gov. Rick Snyder today announced the creation of an independent advisory task force 
charged with reviewing actions regarding water use and testing in Flint and offer recommendations for future 
guidelines to protect the health and safety of all state residents. 


Task force members include experts in public health and medicine, water management, and environmental 
protection from both sides of the aisle, and will be co-chaired by Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants 
and Chris Kolb, of the Michigan Environmental Council. Also serving will be Dr. Matthew Davis of the 
University of Michigan Health System, Eric Rothstein, of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence 
Reynolds of Mott Childrens Health Center in Flint. 


Transitioning back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department-Great Lakes Water Authority is a good first 
step to protecting public health in Flint, but its not the last step, Snyder said. Bringing in outside experts to 
evaluate our actions and help monitor and advise on potential changes to law, procedures and practices will be 
key to continuing work on the comprehensive action plan and ensuring safe drinking water for all the residents 
in Flint and all of Michigan. 


Snyder said the administration will fully cooperate with task force members, saying he wants an unbiased 
report focusing on steps taken in the past and recommendations that could improve practices to ensure all 
residents have access to safe, clean water. 


Ken Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, 
environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and 
Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and 
visiting professor at Grand Valley State University. 


Chris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, 
public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the 
state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council. He has been president of the 
MEC for six years. 


Matthew Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan 
Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having 
joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public 
Health. He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community 
Health/Department of Health and Human Services. 


Eric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served 
as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as 
Jefferson County, Alabamas rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the countys 
bankruptcy and issuance of $1.7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of 
Atlantas Department of Watershed Management. He has more than 30 years of experience in water, 
wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments. 


Lawrence Reynolds, M.D., is a pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Childrens Health 
Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice 
for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on 
behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. 


Snyder has said reconnecting with the authority is a critical step to resolving water quality issues and 
addressing related health concerns. It will not immediately resolve the citys problem with lead service lines or 
aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. 


To best protect public health, state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a 
comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with 
accurate information about steps to eliminate lead exposure. The Michigan Departments of Environmental 
Quality and Health and Human Services are continuing to provide free water filters, free lead testing through 
the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring 
for lead in drinking water.

Ok. You can leave it in my office somewhere. I might stop back in this afternoon. Was it one check for both expense 
reports? 

Detroit: Detroit and Flint are in direct negotiations over their water contact. We hope to have the issue resolved by the 
end of the week and are leaving it to customer and supplier to work out.

Complete a thorough 
review of all steps taken by 
state and local officials 
regarding the decision to 
switch the City of Flint's 
water source to the Flint 
river from the Detroit 
Water and Sewerage 
Department's system 
(DWSD). 

• Produce a timeline of 
actions 

• Establish why each 
action was taken 


QUESTIONS 


What was the basis of cost 
analysis and what 
independent reviews were 
conducted to validate 
investment? 

Why use of interim supply 
- disconnect from DWSD 
before KWA available? 

How do rules / protocols 
regarding local control 
enable discount of regional 
economies? 

Why were permits granted 
with extensive regional 
over-capacity? 


WORK PLAN 


Review cost analysis 
performed for transfer to 
KWA. 

Conduct interviews / review 
documents supporting / 
approving water withdrawal 
permit and KWA investment. 
Conduct interviews (MDEQ, 
Flint, DWSD, ERA) to 
determine reasons for time 
periods between actions. 
Review qualifications / 
expertise of parties involved 
in decision-making. 


Review the roles of the 
federal, state, and local 
officials in the decision- 
making process 

• Identify best practices 
for federal, state, and 
local officials to work 
together in future 
similar situations 

• Evaluate where 
coordination between 
these entities could 
have been better, and 
how it could be 
improved 


Why was flag not raised 
when GM disconnected? 
Were lessons learned by 
other industry water 
source change problems 
considered? How did 
MDEQ address Paragraph 5 
(c) of its LCR 

Implementation guidance 
regarding changes in water 
source? 

Sequence, timing of 
approvals by City, 
Emergency Manager? 
Explain Miguel del Toral 
communication and 
response? 


Interview Marc Edwards, Va 
Tech and review 
documentation of timeline 
presented in "Commentary: 
MDEQ Mistakes and 
Deception Created the Flint 
Water Crisis" in Flint Water 
Updates and "When did 
state know about lead in 
Flint water? 6 takeaways 
from Snyder plan." * 

Develop more 

comprehensive timeline that 
clarifies timing/efforts of 
City's TAC, MDEQ responses, 
etc. 

Review briefing information 
provided to State / local 
officials. 



1 





F! 


Review federal, state, and 
local actions and protocols 

» Determine whether the 
proper procedures were 
followed 
• Identify which 
procedures should be 
changed 


Why doesn't LCR speak to 
potential for problems with 
change in water supply? 

Are timelines reasonable 
for circumstances with 
potential for water 
chemistry changes? Why 
does language focus on 
enabling reduced 
monitoring rather than 
focus on high-risk 
situations? 

What precipitated the 
differing statements on 
Flint's CCT? 

What information is 
available on non-water 
based sources of lead 
contamination? What was 
basis for statement that 
elevation of levels was not 
caused by water? 

Is there an inherent conflict 
of interest if the water 
supplier is responsible for 
selecting sampling sites? 


Obtain independent 
estimates of costs for CCT. 
(Cornwell of NDWAC quoted 
as indicating limited cost, 
but phosphates not 
preferred due to other WQ 
effects.) 

Obtain comparison of Ml 
procedures relative to those 
used in other states. 

Obtain documentation of 
GM withdrawal from use of 
Flint WTP produced water 
and responses. Conduct 
related interviews of GM, 
City, MDEQ personnel. 
Interviews / reviews of 
documentation of testing of 
WQand lead levels (e.g., 
testing of Dr. Mona Flanna- 
Attisha showing spike in 
blood-lead levels in Flint 
children). 


Monitor and review the 
process, procedures, and 
protocols being followed as 
the City of Flint returns to 
the DWSD system 

• Ensure that proper 
corrosion controls and 
testing are in place 

• Highlight the 
appropriate actions that 
the City of Flint should 
follow when the future 
switch is made to the 
Karegnondi Water 
Authority's system 


Obtain Action Plan details 
and review protocol of EPA, 
MDEQ, etc. 

NDWAC review - and 
consideration of lessons 
learned from DC Water, 
other utilities). 




Assess future practices 


How to promote 


* Highlight practices that 
should change for 
communities in similar 
situations 

« Recommend changes in 
law, procedure, or 
practice to ensure all 
Michiganders are 
drinking safe water 


optimization of regional 
excess capacity? 

How to ensure more timely 
response in cases where 
potential problems 
identified? 

What is basis for 2 six- 
month monitoring periods 
(seeming to invite 1 year or 
more of unattended 
problem?) 

Why are high-risk 
populations / sites (e.g., 
schools, hospitals) not 
subject to specific testing in 
standard protocol?

Flint Water 

Larry Reynolds commented on the message: 

FW; Goafs for Task Force 

Thank you for this framework for inquiry. I suggest several other questions. 

1- When was the 9 mile , Flint owned connection to the Detroit water supply sold to Genesee county ? 

2- Did that action eliminate the possibility of reconnecting or increase the cost ? 

3- What was the selling price and how were the proceeds applied or saved ? 

4- Why would the pipeline be built before city infrastructure was improved ? 

5- Why was there a rush to disconnect from Detroit by either party when Highland Park was never 
disconnected from Detroit despite being in arrears ? 

6- What were the communications between then MDCH and MDEQ regarding water quality, health 
concerns, and other similar problems 8-1 0 years prior ?

initial / Skeletal Timeline 

Y'all, 

Attached is an initial timeline document that I compiled over the weekend. I have a bunch more to add 

- including the details of the e-mails identified through FOIA requests - but I am unlikely to be able to 
get much more done before our meeting on Wed. morning given some other project commitments. SO 

- I thought I would pass this along for you to scan and let me know if you think the basic format works. 

Thanks,

Larry Reynolds posted a new message: 

notes to timeline 

Friday, Sept 11. Dr. Mona Flanna -Attisha contacted Dr. Lawrence Reynolds 
with concerns about children’s blood levels in light of Mark Edwards, 

PhD findings. Dr. Mona convened the Hurley Medical Center Research Team. 
Dr. Reynolds contacted the MDCH Childhood Lead Prevention Program by 
phone and left data request for Flint EBLLs. Dr. Reynolds also 
contacted MDEQ staffer who stated MDEQ was waiting for a letter from 
MDCH .REGARDING HEALTH ISSUES AND ACTION. 

Wednesday .September 15-DHHS graph forO-16 yoa children with Flint 
mailing addresses and ELLs to Dr. Reynolds was discussed with two GCHD 
Board of Health (GCBOH )members (chair Kay Doer and member Dr. Laura 
Carravallah )and management staff Medical Director , and John Henry - 
Environmental Hygiene- in 

an informal meeting. The GCBOH chair read the mission of the GCHD aloud. 

GCHD Director’s response was that staff and resources to access MCIR 
data registry for lead levels were not available. A new software had 
been installed and the PDF format required manual extraction for a 
report to get ELLs .ages, and addresses. Also, he said it was the City 
of Flint Department of Public Works’s responsibility to issue a health 
advisory , not the GCHD. 

Monday .September 21- Greater Flint Health Coalition VIEWED 
PRESENTATION BY Dr. Mona H-A and passed a resolution to requesting a 
health advisory for the city of Flint. At noon , members of the GFHC 
met with the mayor-Walling , administrator-Henderson , and the DPW 
director-Crump , requesting action on the resolutions , the HMC research 
, and the Virginia Tech research. The response by the administrator was 
Flint could not change water sources because of cost .Also, the water 





leaving the plant meets MDEQ standards 


Tuesday .September 22- Genesee County Medical Society (GCMS ) passed a 
resolution for the same. 

Thursday , September 24-In the absence of a response by the City 
Administration or the Genesee County Health Department, a press 
conference was called by HMC and GFHC members to advise the community 
of a health emergency with a presentation of the HMC research by Dr. 

Mona H-A , followed by remarks by the GCHD Director , Mark Valacak. The 

city administrator attended. The state continued to dispute the 

findings.

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden: 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich., have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 

For this reason, I am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 
particularly for young children. 

Although the city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have 
conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 
level, there are significant questions about the efficacy of their testing. In fact. Dr. Marc Edwards 
of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group ofhealth professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2015 


Gov. Rick Snyder takes action on initial 
findings from Flint Water Task Force 

Changes to take place at DEQ, meeting planned with Mayor Karen Weaver 


In response to initial findings from the Flint Water Task Force, Gov. Rick Snyder today 
issued the following statement: 

“When I became aware that the city of Flint’s water showed elevated lead levels and that 
the state’s handling of the situation was being questioned, I requested funding to switch 
the source back to the Great Lakes Water Authority and appointed an independent task 
force to identify possible missteps and areas for improvement. 

“The task force has done an exceptional job, reviewing stacks of documents and 
interviewing scores of Flint, Genesee County, state and federal officials. Although the task 
force’s final report is not yet completed, members have made me aware of some interim 
findings and corrective steps that I have decided to take immediately in order to restore 
trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe and informed. 

“We’ll continue to work with the community members to make sure we hear and respond 
to their concerns. 

“In addition, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I’ve determined 
that it’s appropriate to accept it. I’m also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to 
address problems cited by the task force. 

“But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be 
disagreements within the scientific community. That is why I have directed both the 
departments of Environmental Quality and Health and Human Services to invite every 
external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping us improve 
Flint water. Let’s share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can arrive at 



accurate and mutually supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that 
we’re using the very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe drinking 
water and that we’re taking steps to protect their health over the short and long term. 

“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I 
want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is 
not the only city that has an aging infrastructure. 

“I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That’s why I’m 
taking the actions today to ensure a culture of openness and trust. We’ve already 
allocated $10 million to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. Last 
week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and we’re going to meet soon to discuss other 
ways the state can offer assistance. 

“These are only initial steps - we fully expect to take more actions following the 
recommendations of our task force. When it comes to matters of health and quality of life, 
we’re committed to doing everything we can to protect the well-being of our citizens.”

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden: 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich., have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 

For this reason, I am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 
particularly for young children. 

Although the city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have 
conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 
level, there are significant questions about the efficacy of their testing. In fact. Dr. Marc Edwards 
of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group ofhealth professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink.

NICK A. KHOURI 
STATE TREASURER 


DATE: July 1,2015 

TO: Rick Snyder, Governor 

FROM: Wayne Workman, Deputy State Treasurer 

SUBJECT: Status of Financially Stressed Local Governments 

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
Lincoln Park 

Emergency Manager: Brad Coulter 
Appointed: July 3, 2014 
Anticipated Exit: January' 2016 

R ec ent Developments 

An actuarial analysis published on May 20, 2015 shows a further decline in pension 
funding, down to 23%. More conservative actuarial assumptions were used in this report. 
EM Coulter has modified retiree collective bargaining agreements to reduce healthcare 
benefits. These changes are to be implemented on July 1, 2015 and will reduce retiree 
healthcare costs from $4. 1M to S600K annually. 

- City Manager interviews have been conducted. Mathew Coppler, City Manager of 
Enfield Connecticut has been offered the position. 

The city anticipates a $100,000 General Fund Balance at the end of FY 15. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

FY 14 ended with a general fund accumulated deficit of $736K, out of a total budget of 
$21M. This is a significant increase from the FY 13 accumulated deficit of $89K. 
Increases were in Public Safety - S1.1M, Public Works - $700K, and Culture and 
Recreation - $600K. 

Voters rejected the Firefighters and Police Officers Retirement Act proposal last month 
by a 53% to 47% margin. Had it been approved, an additional $3M annually would have 
helped fund fire/police pension and healthcare costs. EM Coulter is pursuing an 
alternative method to establish the same pension system 


Issues to Resolve before EM Exit 
Police CBAs must be finalized. 

Increase and stabilize pension funding levels.

FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION (FRC) 

Detroit 

FRC Created: November 12, 2014 

FRC Members: Nick Khouri, Bill Martin, Brenda Jones, Darrell Burks, John Roberts, Lorron 
James, Mike Duggan, Stacy Fox, Tony Saunders 

Re cen t D evelopments 

The first statutorily required biannual report on Detroit was filed by the Financial Review 
Commission (FRC). The report detailed the FRC’s activities and formal requirements 
since its appointment in November 2014. 

At the May 18, 2015 FRC meeting, members approved various contracts and leases 
related to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department transaction. 

The most intense work the FRC will perform going forward is measuring the 
effectiveness of restaicturing initiatives in light of the large annual pension obligations 
the city will incur beginning in 2024. 

The City of Detroit Assessor’s Office is currently conducting a multi-year project to 
reappraise all properties in Detroit, after the State Tax Commission found significant 
problems with property valuations. The reappraisal is scheduled to be completed in 
2017. 

The next FRC meeting is scheduled for June 22, 2015. 

Significant Action/Issues 

- The city submitted its Four-Year Financial and Operating Plan (Plan) to the FRC in 
March. After reviewing the Plan and determining it was based on sound assumptions and 
met all statutory requirements, the FRC granted approval on April 20, 2015. The city’s 
Plan encompassed the second year (FY 16) of Emergency Manager Orr’s two-year 
budget and used this as its base year with no changes, plus three years (FY 17, FY 18, 
and FY 19). 

RECEIVERSHIP TRANSITION ADVISORY BOARD (RTAB) 

Allen Park 

RTAB Appointed. September 26, 2014 

RTAB Members: Suzanne Schafer, Joyce Parker, Fredrick Frank, Karen Barann 
Recent Developments 

The city completed its move to a new, temporary City Flail on June 8, 2015. Final 
inspections are scheduled for July 17, 2015. 

The city met with the police bargaining unit and is considering a one-year extension to 
the CBA. Treasury is investigating whether existing EM Orders would prohibit changes 
until after the CBA expires June 30, 2015. 

On May 15, 2015, an updated five-year budget projection from the city was received. 
Treasury is evaluating these projections. 

The RTAB approved the hiring of a professional search firm to assist with finding 
qualified City Administrator candidates. Treasury will participate in the selection 
process. Initial screening of applicants is expected to begin in July 2015. 



Page 3 


Completion of the bond tender process, delayed due to uncertainty involving the City 
Administrator position, is projected for early August 2015. Standard & Poor released its 
rating of the city on June 24, 2015, in anticipation of the bond tender release. The city’s 
long term rating was downgraded and further downgrades are suggested. Treasury is 
reviewing this information and its potential impact on the bond tender process. 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on May 26, 2015. It was approved by the 
RTABon June 3, 2015. 

A retired city employee has brought a breach of contract and age discrimination lawsuit 
against the city. The city’s insurance policy covers only a small portion of the alleged 
damages. A conference is set for July 2, 20 1 5. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

- There’s a need to add one member to the RTAB due to possible deadlocked votes with 
the current four-member board. 

In April, the RTAB approved creation of an Interim Deputy City Administrator position 
to oversee city operations until the bond tender and City Hall projects are complete. 
Mark Kibby, former City Manager of the City of Woodhaven, was appointed to this 
position. 

- Litigation was filed by retirees challenging the EM’s authority to reduce other post- 
employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. A motion for summary disposition is pending. 
No date has been set to hear this motion. 

Benton Harbor 

RTAB Appointed: March 10, 2014 

RTAB Members: Larry Steckelberg, Bret Witkowski, Marvin Raglon, Sharon Hunt 
R ecen t Dev elopmen ts 

- There is a vacancy on the city commission due to the passing of Commissioner Mary 
Donald. 

Former Benton Harbor Public Safety Director Roger Lange has brought a Whistleblower 
and Elliot Larson Civil Rights case against the City of Benton Harbor and former 
Emergency Manager Tony Saunders. It is expected the mediation shall take place on 
July 17, 2015, with Jon March, of the law firm of Miller Johnson in Grand Rapids, 
serving as the mediator. 

The Finance Director, Deputy Finance Director, multiple Public Safety Officers, and two 
Public Works Department employees have resigned due to other employment 
opportunities. 

The first annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in July. 

The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 15,2015. 

Significant Actions/lssues 

On April 6, 2015, the City Commission passed resolutions adopting a procurement 
policy, investment policy, and a credit card policy. 

- FY 14 audited general fund revenues exceed expenditures by $1M, out of a total budget 
of $6.1M.

Ecorse 

RTAB Appointed: May 1, 2013 

RTAB Members: Edward Koryzno, Robert Bovitz, Joyce Parker 
Recent Developments 

On May 12, 2015, the RTAB approved a narrowly balanced FY 16 budget, though 
significant deficits are projected in future fiscal years. To balance the budget, the city 
increased an existing PA. 33 levy by approximately 15 mills. 

The City Administrator has requested a new City Controller (third in six months), 
however; the RTAB rejected this appointment at the May meeting. The Mayor has 
submitted a letter of protest, disagreeing with this RTAB decision, and Treasury' officials 
met with him on June 26 lh 

The State Treasurer approved an RTAB recommendation to amend the final EM Order to 
provide RTAB oversight for all hiring and terminations. 

A second annual evaluation from the RTAB will commence in the coming months. Many 
of the deficiencies recognized in the first annual evaluation are expected to be noted in 
this evaluation as well. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

The city continues to have difficulty attracting qualified candidates and filling higher 
level administrative positions. 

Municipal Employee's Retiree System pension contributions are anticipated to increase 
from $1 8M in FY 1 5 to S2.4M in FY 16 due to accelerated funding for closed plans. 

- The city has been unable to balance its five-year budget. Previous budgets project deficit 
spending in FY 16, and exhaustion of all resources in FY 17. To avoid this eventuality, 
significant expense reductions will be necessary in upcoming fiscal years.

Recent Developments 

The City Administrator has issued a Corrective Action Plan to the City Clerk to correct a 
number of operational deficiencies that resulted in the wrong election submission dates 
being provided to local candidates. 

Legislation has been signed that will allow candidates who submitted petitions by April 
28, 2015 to have their names placed on the August Primary ballot. 

U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy denied a motion for a preliminary injunction on 
June 23, 20 1 5, to force the City to purchase water from the City of Detroit. 

The Michigan Court of Appeals, on June 12, 2015, reversed a decision by Genesee 
County Circuit Judge Richard Yuille, who dismissed a claim that the city violated its own 
ordinances when the emergency manager raised water and sewer rates in 2011. 

The RTAB held its first meeting on June 1 1, 2015. 

Jodi Lundquist has assumed the position of CFO. 

As a result of a recent review, the Executive Director of the State Tax Commission 
notified the city that it must maintain adequate assessment records in compliance with 
statute and State Tax Commission Rules, and must implement any corrective actions

necessary. In addition, the city shali implement a full reassessment within a time frame 
agreed upon with the State Tax Commission. The city will be issuing an RFP for a 
reappraisal. 

The city continues to inform residents that it is in violation of the Clean Water Standards 
Act. Monthly testing is ongoing. 

The city is implementing Veolia recommended improvements to its water system, 
including water plant improvements, distribution system improvements, new policies and 
procedures, and better communication with customers. The city is installing a S1.5M 
granulated active-charcoal filter to improve water quality. This filter installation will be 
completed in mid-July. 

The city hired Echologics at a cost of $895,850 to perform a leak detection study. This 
project is scheduled to begin in July 2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

If the city loses a lawsuit over retiree healthcare, the EM’s two-year budget does not 
assume an additional $5M to S6M annual expense which would result and which would 
grow at a rate equal to the general rise in healthcare costs. 

Hamtrainck 

RTAB Appointed: December 18, 2014 

RTAB Members: Deborah Roberts, Mark Sterna, Cathy Square, Karen Young 
Recent Developments 

- The City Council adopted the FY 16 Budget on June 17, 2015. The R TAB approved the 
Budget on June 23, 2015. The city has also developed a long term capital improvement 
plan. 

The city is undertaking a $7 million sewer infrastructure improvement project which is 
eligible for State Revolving Fund monies. The project will reduce storm water inflow 
into the sanitary sewers. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

A suit was filed in federal court by Hamtrainck retirees over changes to healthcare 
benefits made in October 2014. The potential exposure to the city is currently unknown. 
The annual pension liability is anticipated to increase from $3.5M in FY 15 to S4.3M by 
FY 19. This increase is a result of closing certain pension plans and the Michigan 
Employee’s Retirement System (MERS) policy of accelerating the required contribution 
for closed plans. The increases were included in the Emergency Manager’s two-year 
budget.

participate in the selection process. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order to 
initiate proceedings against Gray & Company, the city’s pension investment advisor. 
The proceedings involve Gray & Company’s dealings with investments made by several 
Georgia pension plans in the Gray Co Alternative Fund II LP, a proprietary private equity 
fund. The Pension Board met with Mr. Gray to discuss the SEC proceedings, its effects 
on the Pontiac GERS portfolio, and how much is invested with Gray’s firm. The Pension 
Board is reviewing options for withdrawal of pension assets from Grayson controlled 
funds. 

On May 20, 2015, the RTAB postponed consideration of an amendment to the city’s 
retirement ordinance that would have granted early retirement status to 69 former 
employees. The amendment was adopted by City Council in April with no prior analysis 
or actuarial study being conducted. The best available estimates indicate an impact to the 
pension system of approximately $9-$I3M per year. The ordinance amendment was sent 
back to committee for further review. 

The city lost a decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals which may make it liable for a 
$3.5M payment to the Police and Fire VEBA. The city requested reconsideration but was 
denied On May 20, 2015, the RTAB approved the city’s request to file to the Michigan 
Supreme Court. 

- On May 5, 2015, the city’ s Charter proposal was rejected by voters by a 55% to 45%

The City of Pontiac Retired Employees Association v. City of Pontiac lawsuit (in U S. 
District Court) was reassigned from Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff to Judge Avern Cohn. 
The lawsuit challenges former EM Schimmel’s elimination of retiree healthcare and 
replacement with an annual stipend. The General Employees Retirement System Pension 
Fund is significantly overfunded and the parties are exploring options to use the 
overfunded portion to fund retiree healthcare. Mediation is taking place under the 
supervision of Eugene Driker. 

CONSENT AGREEMENT

On June 29, 2015, an agreement was reached with Wayne County to place a judgment 
levy starting with the December 2015 tax roll, for five years, to repay the county $4.9M 
in past due sewer charges. 

Siunificant Actions/Issues

$9,839,808 which compares with the FY 16 budget of $9,878,991 . The city has prepared 
a proposed five-year budget that shows a deficit in FY 18 to FY 20 unless additional 
revenues can be found. 

Siunificant Actions/Issues 

A fire union CBA was approved in March, resulting in a reduction in health care costs. 

- General fund revenues exceeded expenditures by S885K in FY 14 and the accumulated 
fund balance was $ I 9M. 

Royal Oak Township 

Effective Date: April 2 1, 2014 

Consent Agreement Consultant: Robert Burgess 

Recent Developments 

The Township Supervisor recently provided a legal opinion from a former Township 
Attorney that the Township Board could legally spend the $620K in reimbursed 
retirement assets received from MERS for capital improvement projects. A previous 
Consent Agreement Order prevented spending of these funds. The Township Board did 
not request this legal opinion. Treasury is assisting the Consultant in investigating this 
matter. 

An Order was issued on June 17, 2015, granting the Consultant broad authority to 
approve expenditures made by the township and ensure that obligations are being paid. 
The Order also gives the Consultant authority to return $620K in reimbursed retirement 
assets to MERS. 

Treasury has requested a work plan from the Consultant on how the Township’s Finance 
and Operating Plan will be implemented over the next six months. 



Page 8 


A report issued by the Rehmann Group, the township’s financial consultant, noted that 
the township must make budget adjustments of $164,275 to its FY 15 general fund 
budget to account for expenditures exceeding revenues in FY 14. The township adopted 
budget amendments on May 28, 2015 and implementation is pending. 


Significant Actions/Issues 

Treasury learned that the Township Supervisor was regularly authorizing overtime for 
employees, though overtime was not included in the FY 15 budget and the Consent 
Agreement requires State Treasurer approval prior to overtime expenditures. An Order 
was issued May 20, 2015 requiring the Consultant to approve all requests for overtime 
prior to authorization. 

On May 1 1, 2015, Oakland County approved proposed ballot language for 4 V 2 mills for 
the township’s general operations. The current millage expires December 31, 2015. The 
election is scheduled for August 4, 2015. 

The City of Detroit has declined to provide police services to the township. This is being 
reconsidered with the City of Detroit. Proposals from the cities of Ferndale and Hazel 
Park have been determined to be too expensive. The Michigan State Police continues to 
provide police services to the township in the interim.

The DWSD Director has threatened to terminate water and sewer services if the city 
doesn’t pay its arrearage and current charges. A Wayne Co. Circuit Judge issued a 
temporary restraining order on April 29, 2015 blocking DWSD’s efforts to cut off water 
service to the city. The city was granted a stay on the $20M judgement levy on June 3, 
2015. 

Significant Actions/Issues 



Page 9 


On May 18, 2015. the City Council adopted a resolution requesting MDOT to pay for 
storm water drainage from the highways and freeways under MDOT’s jurisdiction in the 
city. 

On May 18, 2015, City Council approved a consultant’s recommendation for an amnesty 
plan for residential customers to pay arrearage amounts owed to the city. The consultant 
has determined that if all customers take advantage of the amnesty plan, the city could 
collect S2.08M. 

Failure to reach an agreement with DWSD resulted in a $20M judgement levy against 
the city. 

- There are concerns about the city's ability to successfully implement health insurance 
cost reductions as planned in FY15. 

The city’s liabilities total $1 17.6M. Some major components are: $55. 3M debt, including 
$20. 7M owed to the DWSD, $17. 7M pension bonds, and $26. 1M unfunded other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB). 

Summary of the Plan of Adjustment for the City of Highland Park was adopted on 
August 28, 2014: 

o The city must make major reductions to retiree healthcare benefit costs, 
o In September 2015, an emergency loan of $I2M plus restructuring of $4.8M 
existing loans will be requested by the city to refund $2.7M in Fiscal Stabilization 
Bonds, $5.2M in Financial Recovery Bonds, and $3.7M in State Revolving Fund 
Bonds. The status of this request will be reviewed in the context of benchmarks 
the city committed to in their last emergency loan in September 2014. 

OTHER COMMUNITIES 

Wayne County 

Recent Developments 

The Recovery Plan has been released to the public and Treasury has begun an analysis. 

On June 10, 2015, the county announced a settlement with retirees over health care 
benefits that is expected to save $20K annually. 

Significant Actions/Issues 

Cash reserves reached its lowest point in February 2014 with pooled cash falling to 
approximately $22M. The August 2014 cash balance was approximately $150M. This 
includes proceeds from a short-term borrowing of $75M. 

The county’s annual structural general fund deficit is approximately $50M prior to any of 
the proposed remedial actions. 

The county’s proposed restructuring is approximately $50M. 

The preliminary results of the county’s actuarial report indicate a drop in other post- 
employment benefits (OPEB) liability of approximately $409M This reduction is a 
result of the county choosing less expensive plans and implementing cost sharing 
measures (participants are paying a larger share). This does not include any saving 
opportunities resulting from a proposed change to retiree healthcare. 

The county is working to resolve a disagreement with the Mental Health Authority over 
services provided to jail inmates. The county currently pays for this service but believes 
it falls under the purview of the Authority.

The county has not yet proposed a long-term solution to its jail problems.

Re: Letter of Support for Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant 
County: Genesee Local Unit Code: 252040 

To whom it may Concern: 

Please accept this letter as the City of Flint's commitment to the Michigan Department of Treasury's 
Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program for the Dupont Street Water Main 
Replacement Project 

The replacement of 1,6 miles of water main along Dupont Street is an essential step in addressing the 
City's water quality challenges. The City's water system is severely antiquated, which is contributing to 
the current public health emergency, excessive water main breaks, and inefficient distribution of water 
to residents and businesses. The replacement of this water main will move the City closer to providing 
efficient, clean, and safe water to the public. 

Even though the City has progressed to strategically reduce deficits by seeking new millages, reducing 
staff, and reducing services, the City still faces critical financial obstacles. The City does not have the 
financial resources to undertake and pay for a project of this nature. Further, any expenditure by the 
City for goods or services in excess of $75,000 must be approved by a Receivership Transition Advisory 
Board. The FDCVT Grant is essential for the successful implementation of this project, which will 
improve the safety, reliability, and sustainability of the City's water system. 


Respectfully,

Part 5: Proposal Details 

Question 24. Describe the current state of affairs. What is working well? What is not working? Explain 
the current condition of infrastructure/equipment. 

The City is currently facing a public health emergency. Water from the Flint River, the City's water 
source, has been leeching lead from old pipes and solder, contaminating the water supply. Elevated lead 
levels in children were discovered by physicians at Hurley Hospital and The Genesee County Health 
Department has issued a Public Health Advisory. 

The City of Flint is currently in a state of fiscal distress at a time in which considerable demands are 
placed upon it relating to water provision, court orders, and assessing practices compliance. The City is 
attempting to cope with these demands, while revenues are down or drastically reduced. Even though 
the City has progressed to strategically reduce deficits by seeking new millages, reducing the number of 
city employees and related costs, and ultimately reducing the services to the public, the City continues 
to face critical financial challenges. Both the income tax and property tax revenue bases have declined 
by 55% since the economic downturn in 2008. The current resources available to the City are very 
restricted and limited. 

The City of Flint has been in receivership since December 2011. At that time, the State of Michigan 
Financial Review Team found that the City has a General Fund deficit of $14,621,546 as of June 30 th , 
2010, which was not eliminated within the two year preceding period. 

The City previously submitted a five year deficit elimination plan for a cumulative general fund deficit of 
$7,046,820 as of June 30 th , 2008. However, by June 30 th , 2010, the cumulative general fund deficit had 
grown to $14,621,546. An updated plan submitted for 2010 did not purport to eliminate cumulative 
deficit until 2030 and that relied upon the issuance of an additional $12 million of debt in 2013, 

A structural operating deficit existed in the general fund as of June 30, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and the 
General Fund was projected to have a $6,768,864 deficit as of June 30, 2011. 

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was received in 
December 2011. The City's General Fund, which had a $14.6 million deficit at the beginning of the year, 
ended it with an $8.9 million deficit. The reduction in the deficit was due solely to an $8 million Fiscal 
Stabilization Bond issued by the city in March 2011. In total, excluding the impact of the FSB proceeds 
and the Genesee Towers judgment levy, expenses in the General Fund exceeded revenues. The City's 
Comprehensive Financial Report revealed an unassigned deficit in the General Fund of $8,961,427 as of 
June 30, 2014, which had resulted from operating deficits. 

The City does not have a current bond rating. The most recent bond rating was from over a decade ago 
and received a score of Bal, a qualifying indicator of fiscal distress. 

As part of a recent judgment, the City was ordered to repay its Water and Sewer Fund 15.7 million from 
its General Fund. The recent water challenges have also resulted a lower frequency of bill payments 
from residents, further reducing revenues. This places considerable strain on the City's path to recovery 
as it struggles to emerge from receivership.

The City is in transition back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department as the source of water. This 
project comes at a cost of $2 million from the City's Water and Sewer Fund, an unanticipated expense, it 
is imperative that old pipes and water lines need to be addressed in order to arrive at a long term 
solution that will safeguard the public health, return public confidence in the Water System, resulting in 
a return to a sustainable Water and Sewer Fund. The City is the water provider, and as such, it has an 
obligation to provide clean and safe water for residents. 


The Dupont Street Project is a catalytic endeavor that will begin the process of replacing old 
infrastructure and improve the quality of water.

FDCVT Explanation of Proposed Expenditures 


Explanation of Proposed Expenditures 

The following expenditures represent the estimated costs of the Dupont Street Water Main Project 
based on a previous bid for services in 2014 by DiPonio Contracting, Inc. It must be noted that these 
costs represent an estimation by the contractor that is considered to be adequate to cover the 
Contractor's profit and overhead for the project. These costs may be adjusted once work begins. 

These items are essential for the successful implementation of the project, which include the removal 
and/or replacement of trees, sidewalk, driveways, areas of road, and parking lots as well as the 
excavation of the existing water main. Required items also include hydrant assemblies, connecting to 
the existing main, and equipment costs for traffic control.

Appendix C 
Estimated Savings 
of the 

Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Application 



Appendix C 

FDCVT Cost Savings Calculation 

Short Term Savings 

Another area of short term savings is considering the decline in water main breaks with an upgraded 
transmission line. In the past five years, there have been approximately twenty water main breaks in the 
area of the proposed work. Main breaks have cost the City between $5,000 and $10,000 each to repair. 
This has amounted to $100,000 to $200,000 in water main repair costs in just that area alone. On 
average we can expect a savings of $40,000 in the first year alone ($200,000/5 years = $40,000 per year) 

Long Term Savings 

The ultimate longterm benefits of the project are concerned with providing reliable, clean, and safe 
drinking water for Flint water customers. This area suffers from poor water quality due to longer 
retention times as a result of inhibited flow. Resolving this is essential to regain public confidence in City 
provided utilities, which affect bill collections and the overall fiscal health of the Water and Sewer Fund. 
Addressing antiquated infrastructure is a necessary step to secure public health. 

Other savings of this project include the elimination of leaks by replacing the line. Roughly one-third of 
the water that the City will be purchasing from Detroit will be lost due to leakage from an extremely 
antiquated system, the use of water when addressing incidents of arson, and water theft or waste from 
scrapping. Considering that water from DWSD will cost an estimated $1.5 million per month, $500,000 
worth of water that is purchased will never be billed every month. That amounts to $6 million per year 
and $30,000,000 per year if the pattern to repair these aging lines continues through completion. This is 
a significant waste. Replacing the Dupont Water Main is an essential step in mitigating this loss.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
CITY OF FLINT 

GENESEE COUNTY MICHIGAN 
ORDER No. 18 

ADOPTION OF THE DEFICIT ELIMINATION/RESERVE 
ACCUMULATION PLAN 

BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY VESTED IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGER 
("EMERGENCY MANAGER”) FOR THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN ("CITY”) 
PURSUANT TO MICHIGAN'S PUBLIC ACT 436 OF 2012, LOCAL FINANCIAL 
STABILITY AND CHOICE ACT, ("PA 436"); DARNELL EARLEY, THE EMERGENCY 
MANAGER, ISSUES THE FOLLOWING ORDER: 


Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager has broad powers in receivership to rectify the 
financial emergency and to assure the fiscal accountability of the City and its capacity to provide 
or cause to be provided necessary services essential to the public health, safety and welfare; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager acts in place of local officials, specifically the 
Mayor and City Council, unless the Emergency Manager delegates specific authority; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager shall develop and may amend a written financial 
and operating plan for the City, which shall have the objectives of assuring that the City is able 
to provide or cause to be provided governmental services essential to the public health, safety 
and welfare and assuring the fiscal accountability of the local government; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, an Emergency manager may require and approve or disapprove, or amend 
or revise, a plan for paying all outstanding obligations of the local government; and 

The FY13 Financial Statements for the City of Flint for FY13 disclosed a $12,895,642 General 
Fund deficit. Most of this deficit arises from various inter-fbnd borrowings in the form of cash 
advances to the General Fund from other funds, implemented over the past several years. The 
deficit has been significantly reduced from the FY 1 2 deficit of $ 1 9.2 million. 



advances to the General Fund from other funds, implemented over the past several years. The 
deficit has been significantly reduced from the FY12 deficit of $19.2 million. 

This Order further reduces the deficit in FY14 and authorizes actions in subsequent years to 
eliminate the deficit. This Order is based on the commitment that in future years, expenses in the 
General Fund will not exceed revenues, thus assuring that the deficit will reduce, not grow. 

This Order also recognizes that achieving long term financial solvency requires not only the 
elimination of deficits but the accumulation of financial reserves at an adequate level. 

This Order recognizes reductions made or projected for this year and authorizes and directs 
additional steps to eliminate the deficit and to establish an appropriate level of reserves as 
necessary for sustainable financial solvency: 

• It is projected that the $12,895,642 General Fund deficit as of the end of FY13 will be 
reduced by $2,702,097 to $10,195,342 at the end of FY14, as a result of revenues 
exceeding expenses. 

• The General Fund debts to Fund 636 (Information Technology) and Fund 542 (Building 
Safety) in the total amount of $393,545 will be discharged before the end of FY14, thus 
further reducing the deficit to $9,800,000. Discharging these debts will not compromise 
the financial solvency of these funds. 

• $800,000 will be transferred from the Capital Improvements Fund to the Sewer Fund, and 
the General Fund debt to the Sewer Fund will be discharged in a like amount, thus 
reducing the General Fund deficit at the end of FY14 to $9,000,000. 

Continuing in the FY15 budget and future years, until the remaining accumulated deficit is 
eliminated, expenses will be budgeted at $1 million less than revenues, thus providing for 
additional deficit reduction. Additionally, $800,000 annually will be appropriated from the 
Public Improvement Fund for capital improvement funding in Fund 590 (Sewer Fund) in lieu of 
repayment of cash advances from Fund 590. Using these funds, deficit reduction will continue as 
follows: 

• FY15: $9,000,000 reduced to $7,200,000 

• FY16: $7,200,000 reduced to $5,400,000 

• FY17: $5,400,000 reduced to $3,600,000 

• FY18: $3,600,000 reduced to $1,800,000 

• FY19: $1,800,000 reduced to $-0- 

Beginning in FY20, or sooner should the deficit be eliminated sooner, expenses in the General 
Fund will continue to be annually budgeted at a maximum of $1 million less than General Fund 
revenues, and expenses in the Public Improvement Fund shall continue to be budgeted at a 
maximum of $800,000 less than Public Improvement Fund revenues. This shall continue until, at 
a minimum, the accumulation of funds reach 15% of General Fund revenues. The goal is to have 
and maintain financial reserves equal to or exceeding 15% of General Fund revenues at any time. 


2 



These steps are to be viewed as the minimum actions to be taken with respect to eliminating the 
deficit and accumulating adequate financial reserves. It is recognized that accomplishing these 
goals as quickly as possible is desirable. 

Pursuant to Act 436, section 12(1), I hereby order that the General Fund debt associated with the 
cash advances to Funds 636, and 542 in the amounts of $500,000 and $110,000 respectively, are 
hereby discharged. 

I further order that the General Fund debt associated with the cash advance to Fund 591 in the 
amount of $1,000,000 will be repaid at the end of FY14 with the surplus of General Fund 
revenues over expenses budgeted for deficit reduction and that $800,000 will be appropriated 
from Fund 402 to Fund 590 for capital improvements, and that the General Fund debt associated 
with the cash advance from Fund 590 is hereby reduced by $800,000. 

I further order that the General Fund debt associated with the cash advances to Fund 590 
remaining after FY14 will be repaid in the amount of $1 million annually for each of the years 
FY15 through FY19 from the General Fund. Additionally, for the same period, there shall be an 
annual appropriation from the Public Improvement Fund in the amount of $800,000 to be used 
for capital improvements, and the General Fund debt associated with the cash advance from 
Fund 590 shall be reduced in a corresponding manner. 

I further order that once the deficit is eliminated, expenses in the General Fund shall continue to 
be annually budgeted at a maximum of $1 million less than General Fund revenues, and 
expenses in the Public Improvement Fund shall continue to be budgeted at a maximum of 
$800,000 less than Public Improvement Fund revenues until such time as the accumulation of 
funds from these actions reach, at a minimum 15% of General Fund revenues. The goal is to 
have and maintain financial reserves equal to or exceeding 15% of General Fund revenues at any 
time. Some portion of the funds accumulated by this action may be transferred to the City’s 
Budget Stabilization Fund, with no less than an amount equal to 5% of General Fund revenues 
remaining in the General Fund. 

I further order that the attached Deficit Elimination Plan is hereby adopted on behalf of the City 
of Flint. The Finance Director is authorized to take such actions and accounting measures as 
necessary to implement this order. 

The above stated orders are effective immediately. 

This Order may be amended, modified, repealed or terminated by any subsequent Order issued 
by the Emergency Manager.

CITY OF FLINT 

OFFICE OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGER 


Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 

April 28, 2015 

Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
1 1 1 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, Ml 48909 

Dear Governor Snyder: ' 

The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 201 1 . Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and I feel that the 
financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. I feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position as 
Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, 1 was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of PA 
436 of2012. 1 am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint; my predecessors were Michael K. Brown (PA 4 
and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major steps 
toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and financial best 
practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and levels of service 
provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, characterized 
by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and unsustainable legacy 
costs. At the conclusion of FY 1 2, the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager was appointed, the City’s 
General Fund deficit stood at $19.1 million; its Water Fundhad a deficit of $8.8 million; and cash flow was 
$13 million, or less than one month’s expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street lighting; 
waste collection was changed to a fee for service from a millage rate; and increases in utility rates to among 
the highest in the state. Services have been reduced to marginal levets (including public

safely), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrunk by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General Fund 
deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan Board. 
City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have been 
enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the requirement 
for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and maintenance of a 
biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund balance reserve, 
including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a requirement to begin 
funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees in defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over daily 
activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City operations have 
been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collection and demolition is no longer being done 
internally, 911 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 2015, and the City- 
funded 68 th District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 67 Ul District Court in 
January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the Karegondi Water Authority 
instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Collective bargaining contracts have also 
been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the stage for permanent reductions 
in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the level of parks maintenance. 
Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, with reduced assistance from 
the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new Master 
Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has been 
completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new zoning 
ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces significantly 
engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the Flint City 
Council, with the support of the Mayor. 



Governor Snyder

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current Charter 
and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which will be 
elected in May 2015. The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current Strong Mayor 
form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 

Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work on 
the part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit over 
its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is currently 
operating under a judge’s order which allows modification of the City’s historical level of health 
care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 

• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a long 
term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently provides is 
not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result in costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint’s total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This millage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago, are 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety services, even with the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This was recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 100 more officers on the street than Flint does. 



Governor Snyder 
April 28, 2015 
Page 4 


• Equally important to providing State support in die form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to fund the City’s lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City’s 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 

Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of P.A. 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, I am prepared to say that 1 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 2.1(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved, 1 recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisoiy Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act. I believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to full local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and tire new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 

If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to the 
historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of City 
leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 

Sincerely, 



Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

Appendix C 

FDCVT Cost Savings Calculation 
Short Term Savings 

Another area of short term savings is considering the decline in water main breaks with an upgraded 
transmission line, In the past five years, there have been approximately twenty water main breaks in the 
area of the proposed work. Main breaks have cost the City between $5,000 and $10,000 each to repair. 
This has amounted to $100,000 to $200,000 in water main repair costs in just that area alone. On 
average we can expect a savings of $40,000 in the first year alone {$200,000/5 years = $40,000 per year) 

Long Term Savings 

The ultimate long term benefits of the project are concerned with providing reliable, clean, and safe 
drinking water for Flint water customers. This area suffers from poor water quality due to longer 
retention times as a result of inhibited flow. Resolving this is essential to regain public confidence in City 
provided utilities, which affect bill collections and the overall fiscal health of the Water and Sewer Fund. 
Addressing antiquated infrastructure is a necessary step to secure public health. 

Other savings of this project include the elimination of leaks by replacing the line. Roughly one-third of 
the water that the City will be purchasing from Detroit will be lost due to leakage from an extremely 
antiquated system, the use of water when addressing incidents of arson, and water theft or waste from 
scrapping. Considering that water from DWSD will cost an estimated $1.5 million per month, $500,000 
worth of water that is purchased will never be billed every month. That amounts to $6 million per year 
and $30,000,000 per year if the pattern to repair these aging lines continues through completion. This is 
a significant waste. Replacing the Dupont Water Main is an essential step in mitigating this loss.

Part 4 Question 17: 

Existing Condition of Financial Distress 

The City of Flint is currently in a state of fiscal distress at a time in which considerable demands are 
placed upon it relating to water provision, court orders, and assessing practices compliance. The City is 
attempting to cope with these demands, while revenues are down or drastically reduced. Even though 
the City has progressed to strategically reduce deficits by seeking new millages, reducing the number of 
city employees and related costs, and ultimately reducing the services to the public, the City continues 
to face critical financial challenges. Both the income tax and property tax revenue bases have declined 
by 55% since the economic downturn in 2008. The current resources available to the City are very 
restricted and limited. 

The City of Flint has been in receivership since December 2011. At that time, the State of Michigan 
Financial Review Team found that the City has a General Fund deficit of $14,621,546 as of June 30 th , 
2010, which was not eliminated within the two year preceding period. 

The City previously submitted a five year deficit elimination plan for a cumulative general fund deficit of 
$7,046,820 as of June 30 th , 2008. Flowever, by June 30 th , 2010, the cumulative general fund deficit had 
grown to $14,621,546. An updated plan submitted for 2010 did not purport to eliminate cumulative 
deficit until 2030 and that relied upon the issuance of an additional $12 million of debt in 2013. 

A structural operating deficit existed in the general fund as of June 30, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and the 
General Fund was projected to have a $6,768,864 deficit as of June 30, 2011. 

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was received in 
December 2011. The City's General Fund, which had a $14.6 million deficit at the beginning of the year, 
ended it with an $8.9 million deficit. The reduction in the deficit was due solely to an $8 million Fiscal 
Stabilization Bond issued by the city in March 2011. In total, excluding the impact of the FSB proceeds 
and the Genesee Towers judgment levy, expenses in the General Fund exceeded revenues. The City's 
Comprehensive Financial Report revealed an unassigned deficit in the General Fund of $8,961,427 as of 
June 30, 2014, which had resulted from operating deficits. 

The City does not have a current bond rating. The most recent bond rating was from over a decade ago 
and received a score of Bal, a qualifying indicator of fiscal distress. 

As part of a recent judgment, the City was ordered to repay its Water and Sewer Fund 15.7 million from 
its General Fund. This places considerable strain on the City's path to recovery as it struggles to emerge 
from receivership.

Question 24: 

Tax Management Associates who conducted the 2014 Audit of Minimum Assessing Requirements 
Review for the State Tax Commission revealed that the City of Flint was found to have a number of 
deficiencies in its assessing practices. The City's ability to accurately assess and determine property 
valuation is critical to its success while it struggles to emerge from receivership. As part of the City's 
Corrective Action Plan, which was approved by the State Tax Commission on June 18, 2015, a complete 
reappraisal of the City's real properties is required by the State Tax Commission. The City is in critical 
need to re-establish the appropriate valuation of the City's tax base, which translates to the projected 
property tax revenue for the City. The City's Assessing Division has been unable to keep pace with 
current trends and operational demands and a full and comprehensive reappraisal of its real property of 
the City has not been conducted in over 35 years. This project will provide the foundation for doing so. 
This appraisal is required in order to bring the City into compliance with Michigan minimum assessing 
requirements as they relate to land value determinations, economic conditions factors, and matching 
the true cash value on record with that of the assessing roles among other vital activities of the City's 
Assessing Division. 

Question 26: 

The City of Flint must become compliant with the Michigan Assessor's Manual and implement the 
Corrective Action Plan as required by the State Tax Commission. It has been over 35 years since 
properties in the City of Flint have been reappraised in total. Reappraisal of properties within the city 
will help to secure and strengthen the accuracy of the City's tax revenue collection efforts and bring it 
into compliance with State standards. 

Every year, roughly 1500 to 2000 homes in Flint go into tax foreclosure. Lost tax revenue for the City is 
estimated to be 2.3 million in 2013 and 2.6 million in 2014. In addition to the lost tax revenue for the 
City, this negatively affects the stability of neighborhoods, often causing displacement and sometimes 
blight. By reappraising the residential properties in Flint, values more accurately reflect market 
conditions. In areas where property values increase, this means more tax revenue for the City, in areas 
where property values are expected to decrease, this has the potential to result in more affordable 
taxes. The overall lower payment resulting from this decrease could reduce the foreclosure rate, helping 
to secure homeownership, stabilize neighborhoods, and reduce instances of blight. 


Question 27: 

The proposal seeks to satisfy requirement number six in the City's Corrective Action Plan for the 2014 
AMAR Review, which includes the reappraisal of all real property within the city. 

The initial objectives are, as follows: 

1, Provide an update of property record characteristics in the City's BS&A system to reflect current 
conditions. 

2. Use-high resolution, street view imagery, high-resolution aerial orthophotography, and low-level 
oblique aerial images to remotely verify or correct property characteristics.

Appendix 1: Supplemental Answers and Work Plan 


3. Establish new workflows and procedures within assessment division incorporating the use of 
modern technology and techniques to consistently maintain accurate records of subsequent 
assessment year cycles following the completion of this project. 

4. Improve quality and accessibility of public information for valuation purposes to demonstrate it 
is representative of actual, current conditions. 

5. Provide a uniform analysis of real property value to be consistent with the best appraisal 
practices. 

Long term success will be measured by the City's performance and demonstrated compliance with 
minimum assessing standards on the next State Tax Commission AMAR Review scheduled for 2019. The 
desired outcome is improved effectiveness, accuracy, and compliance of the City's assessing practices 
with State standards as well as bringing property values in-line with the market.

Question 31: 

WORK PLAN 

Implementation steps to ensure the proposal's success. 

Proposal to Reappraise Real Property Work Plan and anticipated outcomes: 

1. Issue Request for Proposal as required by the Corrective Action Plan. 

Outcomes: The projected outcome for this is to properly select a vendor who possesses 
a minimum of five years of experience providing services requested in the RFP and 
whose estimated cost is the most efficient for services requested, 

2. The vendor's anticipated start date is June 1, 2016 

3. Sketch/digitation portion begins in June 2016. 

Outcomes: 

a. Vendor will provide digital property sketches in Apex Sketch format to the City in a 
format that can be directly imported into the City's BS&A system. The sketch details to 
be collected and represented shall adhere to those defined in the most current version 
of the Michigan State Tax Commission's' Assessor's Manual. 

Vendors will review each digitized Apex Sketch to ensure its perimeter measurements, 
sections, and annotations, correspond to the structure (s) and associated improvements 
evaluated in the imagery provided by the City. 

4. Appraisal Data Verification portion begins in January 2017. The City will prioritize geographic 
areas of the City that will be evaluated first. 

Outcomes: 

a. An onsite data verification process will have been conducted for all real parcels to 
determine whether the existing property improvement characteristics are consistent 
with existing records. Inconsistent parcel records will be identified and their proposed 
corrected characteristics will be reported to the City so the City's database can be 
updated. 

b. Commercial and Industrial Property Classifications 

i. Field inspections and appraisal of commercial and industrial real properties 
including land, buildings, fixtures, classified as real estate and located in the City 
in order to verify measurements, including a physical description of the property 
improvements, a listing of the building components, and construction date 
design, and current usage of the various sections of the facility. The data 
includes functional and economic factors affecting the true cash value of the 
property. 

5. Property appraisal valuation study begins December 2017. 


Page 4 of 5 



Appendix 1: Supplemental Answers and Work Plan 


a. Existing neighborhood areas studied to account for homogenous property 
characteristics, land uses, economic activity, natural features, transportation features, 
demographics, and structure similarities, 

b. The vendor shall have produced estimates of value based upon the standards outlined 
in the most current version of the Michigan Assessor's Manual approved by the 
Michigan State Tax Commission. 

6. The vendor's completion deadline is July 1, 2019. 

a. The intended final outcome is for the City to have an updated set of data, tools, and 
assessing practices that conform to the Michigan Assessor's Manual in order to 
successfully complete the next AMAR review by the State Tax Commission.

The proposed expenditures reflect the estimated costs of the Property Reappraisal Project, which were 
ascertained by recent appraisals of individual parcels and then extrapolated to achieve projected costs 
for the entire city. The costs of the Property Reappraisal Project include a physical appraisal by 
personnel in the field, and include the digitization of property sketches and the Economic Conditions 
Factors calculation for the City's assessing databases. These costs are discounted by Local Participation 
Factors, which account for parcels that do not need to be included in the reappraisal or that which have 
already recently been reappraised by city staff. 

The reappraisal of residential, commercial, industrial, and other properties are all equally required 
proposed expenditures. All of the included parcels that have not been discounted by Local Participation 
must be reappraised in order to comply with the stipulations enforced by the State Tax Commission 
according to the City's Corrective Action Plan before the city's next AMAR review, which is scheduled for 
2019. 

These expenditures account for the reappraisal of residential, commercial, industrial, and other parcels 
that are not vacant. The vacant parcels have been discounted from the costs of this project because in 
most cases, vacant parcels have already been reassessed by city staff. Additionally, these vacant parcels 
are not of significant priority and are thus not essential for a comprehensive reappraisal of the City's 
parcels. The estimations of discounted costs due to progress already achieved by city staff in 
combination with needless reappraisal of vacant properties is accounted for in the Local Participation 
column of the proposed expenditures table.

The most significant costs in this project is the reappraisal of 38,787 Residential Improved properties, 
which is $2,605,950,00 and includes all of the neighborhoods throughout the city that have not already 
been reappraised by city staff. This element is essential to verify and stabilize the City's tax base by 
bringing property values in line with the market, thereby improving the accuracy of tax collection 
efforts. This cost is then followed by the cost of reappraising 2,503 Commercial Improved parcels at 
$375,450,00. The reappraisal of 263 Industrial Improved parcels follows at a cost of $67,065.00, finishing 
with a cost of $11,250.00 for 30 Other parcels throughout the City that do not fall into the above 
categories.

EMERGENCY MANAGER 
CITY OF FLINT 

GENESEE COUNTY MICHIGAN 
ORDER No, 18 

ADOPTION OF THE DEFICIT ELIMINATION/RESERVE 
ACCUMULATION PLAN 

BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY VESTED IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGER 
("EMERGENCY MANAGER”) FOR THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN ("CITY”) 
PURSUANT TO MICHIGAN'S PUBLIC ACT 436 OF 2012, LOCAL FINANCIAL 
STABILITY AND CHOICE ACT, ("PA 436"); DARNELL EARLEY, THE EMERGENCY 
MANAGER, ISSUES THE FOLLOWING ORDER: 


Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager has broad powers in receivership to rectify the 
financial emergency and to assure the Fiscal accountability of the City and its capacity to provide 
or cause to be provided necessary services essential to the public health, safety and welfare; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager acts in place of local officials, specifically the 
Mayor and City Council, unless the Emergency Manager delegates specific authority; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, the Emergency Manager shall develop and may amend a written financial 
and operating plan for the City, which shall have the objectives of assuring that the City is able 
to provide or cause to be provided governmental services essential to the public health, safety 
and welfare and assuring the fiscal accountability of the local government; and 

Pursuant to PA 436, an Emergency manager may require and approve or disapprove, or amend 
or revise, a plan for paying all outstanding obligations of the local government; and 

The FY13 Financial Statements for the City of Flint for FY13 disclosed a $12,895,642 General 
Fund deficit. Most of this deficit arises from various inter-fund borrowings in the form of cash 
advances to the General Fund from other funds, implemented over the past several years. The 
deficit has been significantly reduced from the FY12 deficit of $19.2 million. 




advances to the General Fund from other funds, implemented over the past several years. The 
deficit has been significantly reduced from the FY12 deficit of $19.2 million. 

This Order further reduces the deficit in FY14 and authorizes actions in subsequent years to 
eliminate the deficit. This Order is based on the commitment that in future years, expenses in the 
General Fund will not exceed revenues, thus assuring that the deficit will reduce, not grow. 

This Order also recognizes that achieving long term financial solvency requires not only the 
elimination of deficits but the accumulation of financial reserves at an adequate level. 

This Order recognizes reductions made or projected for this year and authorizes and directs 
additional steps to eliminate the deficit and to establish an appropriate level of reserves as 
necessary for sustainable financial solvency: 

• It is projected that the $12,895,642 General Fund deficit as of the end of FY13 will be 
reduced by $2,702,097 to $10,195,342 at the end of FY14, as a result of revenues 
exceeding expenses. 

• The General Fund debts to Fund 636 (Information Technology) and Fund 542 (Building 
Safety) in the total amount of $393,545 will be discharged before the end of FY14, thus 
further reducing the deficit to $9,800,000. Discharging these debts will not compromise 
the financial solvency of these funds. 

• $800,000 will be transferred from the Capital Improvements Fund to the Sewer Fund, and 
tlie General Fund debt to the Sewer Fund will he discharged in a like amount, thus 
reducing the General Fund deficit at the end of FY14 to $9,000,000. 

Continuing in the FY15 budget and future years, until the remaining accumulated deficit is 
eliminated, expenses will be budgeted at $1 million less than revenues, thus providing for 
additional deficit reduction. Additionally, $800,000 annually will be appropriated from the 
Public Improvement Fund for capital improvement funding in Fund 590 (Sewer Fund) in lieu of 
repayment of cash advances from Fund 590. Using these funds, deficit reduction will continue as 
follows: 

• FY15: $9,000,000 reduced to $7,200,000 

• FY16: $7,200,000 reduced to $5,400,000 

• FY17: $5,400,000 reduced to $3,600,000 

• FY18: $3,600,000 reduced to $1,800,000 

• FY19: $1,800,000 reduced to $-0- 

Beginning in FY20, or sooner should the deficit be eliminated sooner, expenses in the General 
Fund will continue to be annually budgeted at a maximum of $1 million less than General Fund 
revenues, and expenses in the Public Improvement Fund shall continue to be budgeted at a 
maximum of $800,000 less than Public Improvement Fund revenues. This shall continue until, at 
a minimum, the accumulation of funds reach 1 5% of General Fund revenues. The goal is to have 
and maintain financial reserves equal to or exceeding 15% of General Fund revenues at any time. 


2 



These steps are to be viewed as the minimum actions to be taken with respect to eliminating the 
deficit and accumulating adequate financial reserves. It is recognized that accomplishing these 
goals as quickly as possible is desirable. 

Pursuant to Act 436, section 12(1), I hereby order that the General Fund debt associated with the 
cash advances to Funds 636, and 542 in the amounts of $500,000 and $1 10,000 respectively, are 
hereby discharged. 

I further order that the General Fund debt associated with the cash advance to Fund 591 in the 
amount of $1,000,000 will be repaid at the end of FY14 with the surplus of General Fund 
revenues over expenses budgeted for deficit reduction and that $800,000 will be appropriated 
from Fund 402 to Fund 590 for capital improvements, and that the General Fund debt associated 
with the cash advance from Fund 590 is hereby reduced by $800,000. 

I further order that the General Fund debt associated with the cash advances to Fund 590 
remaining after FY14 will be repaid in the amount of $1 million annually for each of the years 
FY15 through FY19 from the General Fund. Additionally, for the same period, there shall be an 
annual appropriation from the Public Improvement Fund in the amount of $800,000 to be used 
for capital improvements, and the General Fund debt associated with the cash advance from 
Fund 590 shall he reduced in a corresponding manner. 

I further order that once the deficit is eliminated, expenses in the General Fund shall continue to 
be annually budgeted at a maximum of $1 million less than General Fund revenues, and 
expenses in the Public Improvement Fund shall continue to be budgeted at a maximum of 
$800,000 less than Public Improvement Fund revenues until such time as the accumulation of 
funds from these actions reach, at a minimum 15% of General Fund revenues. The goal is to 
have and maintain financial reserves equal to or exceeding 15% of General Fund revenues at any 
time. Some portion of the funds accumulated by this action may be transferred to the City’s 
Budget Stabilization Fund, with no less than an amount equal to 5% of General Fund revenues 
remaining in the General Fund. 

I further order that the attached Deficit Elimination Plan is hereby adopted on behalf of the City 
of Flint. The Finance Director is authorized to take such actions and accounting measures as 
necessary to implement this order. 

The above stated orders are effective immediately. 

This Order may be amended, modified, repealed or terminated by any subsequent Order issued 
by the Emergency Manager.

OFFICE OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGER 




Gerald Ambrose 
Emergency Manager 

April 28, 2015 



Honorable Rick Snyder 
Governor of Michigan 
1 1 1 South Capitol Avenue 
Lansing, Ml 48909 

Dear Governor Snyder: 

The City of Flint has been in a state of receivership since your declaration of a financial emergency in 
November 2011. Since that time a number of substantial changes have been implemented and 1 feel that the 
financial emergency has been sufficiently addressed. 1 feel it is appropriate to relinquish my position as 
Emergency Manager (EM) at this time. 

As you are aware, 1 was appointed Emergency Manager on January 13, 2015, under the authority of PA 
436 of 20 1 2. 1 am the fourth EM to serve the City of Flint; my predecessors were Michael K. Brown (PA 4 
and PA 436), Edward Kurtz (PA 72 and PA 436) and Darnell Earley (PA 436). Each EM took major steps 
toward rectifying the financial emergency. These steps included implementing budgetary and financial best 
practices, restructuring the City departmental organization, implementing new means and levels of service 
provision, and preparing the City for long term stability. 


Addressing the Financial Emergency: 

At the time of placement into state receivership, the City of Flint was a city in financial crisis, characterized 
by accumulated deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund, marginal cash flow, and unsustainable legacy 
costs. At the conclusion of F Y 1 2, the fiscal year in which an Emergency Manager was appointed, the City’s 
General Fund deficit stood at $19.1 million; its Water Fund had a deficit of $8.8 million; and cash flow was 
$13 million, or less than one month’s expenses. Unfunded OPEB liabilities were more that $850 million. 

Addressing these issues and putting Flint back onto a path to sustain financial solvency has been difficult 
for taxpayers, employees, retirees, and those utilizing city services. Taxes and fees have been raised, 
including a voter approved six mill special levy for police and fire; a special assessment for street lighting: 
waste collection was changed to a fee for service from a miilage rate: and increases in utility rates to among 
the highest in the State. Services have been reduced to marginal levels (including public

safety), as the workforce and employee compensation has shrunk by more than 20%. And, retirees have 
seen their cost of retiree health care increase. 

As a result, much progress has been made: 

• The deficits in the General Fund and Water Fund have been addressed. The Water Fund is now 
solvent, although not at the level indicated as adequate; and the remaining $7 million General Fund 
deficit will be eliminated by June 30, 2015, with a loan authorized by the Emergency Loan Board. 
City wide cash flow is now more than $67 million. 

• New ordinances addressing the achievement and maintenance of financial sustainability have been 
enacted by the City Council, with support of the Mayor. These ordinances include the requirement 
for creation and maintenance of a strategic plan; requirement for creation and maintenance of a 
biennial budget and five year financial projections; establishment of a fund balance reserve, 
including establishment of a budget stabilization fund; establishment of a requirement to begin 
funding of OPEB liabilities; and an update of the City’s purchasing ordinance. 

• Long term liability costs have been reduced significantly. $850 million in OPEB liabilities have 
been reduced to $240 million, and new employees are given a contribution towards future health 
care costs at retirement instead of the promise of retiree health care. Current retirees now pay a 
significant amount towards their health care. Multipliers for remaining employees hi defined 
benefit programs have been reduced, and new employees are enrolled in a hybrid pension plan, 
which has less long term liability for the City. The Flint Employees Retirement System has been 
dissolved, with pension administration now handled by the Municipal Employees Retirement 
System. 

• The structure of the City organization has been changed significantly. A new City Administrator 
has been hired, selected on the basis of professional expertise, and with expanded control over daily 
activities of the City. The workforce has been reduced by more than 20%, and City operations have 
been reorganized into four program areas. Waste collectiou and demolition is no longer being done 
internally, 911 operations will be transferred to the County effective July 1, 2015, and the City- 
funded 68 lh District Court is expected to become part of the County- funded 67 lh District Court in 
January, 2016. The purchase of water is now planned to come from the Karegondi Water Authority 
instead of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Collective bargaining contracts have also 
been revised; increasing flexibility for management and setting the stage for permanent reductions 
in legacy costs. Partnerships have been established to improve the level of parks maintenance. 
Senior Centers are now run by independent non-profit organizations, with reduced assistance from 
the City; and the City golf courses have been leased to private operators. 

• The City has put into place a plan for long term stabilization and future development. A new Master 
Plan (the first since the 1960’s) has been adopted, a new Capital Improvement Plan has been 
completed, and a new framework for a Blight Elimination Plan has been developed. A new zoning 
ordinance is well on its way to completion. Each of these major planning pieces significantly 
engaged members of the community and the final products were approved by the Flint City 
Council, with the support of the Mayor. 



Governor Snyder 
April 28, 2015

• A Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance was established by EM Earley in 2014. The committee 
recommended a number of Charter revisions and recommended the election of a Charter Review 
Committee. In November 2014 the voters in Flint approved several revisions to the current Charter 
and also approved establishing a Charter Review Commission, the members of which will be 
elected in May 2015, The Commission will consider whether to maintain the current Strong Mayor 
form of governance or to propose a new Council-Manager format. 

• A formal assessment of the values of both Hurley Hospital and the City’s utility system have been 
completed; and concluded that no change in ownership status would be beneficial at this time. 

Continuing Challenges: 

Significant work has been accomplished to resolve the conditions which put the City of Flint into State 
receivership. However, there also still exist several major challenges which will require continued work on 
die part of the City leaders: 

• Retiree health care continues to be a significant concern as the City still faces a federal lawsuit over 
its decision to change (but not eliminate) health care for current retirees. While the City is currently 
operating under a judge’s order which allows modification of the City’s historical level of health 
care for retirees, a loss could have an impact of more than $5 million annually. 

• The five year revenue projections still identify a structural deficit. Annual costs for wages and 
fringes will continue to rise at an approximate 2.4% rate. There is not a comparable increase in 
projected revenue, which is closer to 1%. While it may be possible to continue the low level of 
services that Flint now provides for a short while, even that level will be in jeopardy without a long 
term sustainable new source of revenue. The low level of services that Flint currently provides is 
not at the level which will help the City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. 

• Aging water and sewer systems designed to serve twice as many customers as the number now 
using the systems have resulted in water and sewer rates that are among the highest in the state. 
This is another factor impeding the City’s ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 
There needs to be a concerted effort to reduce rates by as much as 50%, but that cannot even be 
contemplated without the commitment of financial assistance from the state and federal 
governments. While the decision to join with Genesee County in the creation of the KWA will 
result ill costs for purchasing water increasing at a rate less than historically paid to the previous 
supplier, it will not be sufficient to lower costs. 

• Continuing voter support for special millages financing public safety is a concern. In 2012 voters 
approved a 6 mill property tax levy for police and fire, bringing Flint’s total level to within 1 mill 
of its maximum 20 mill limit. This miltage, plus one for 2 mills approved some time ago, are 
expiring in 2017, and without renewal, the resulting level of public safety services, even with the 
current level of greatly appreciated State Police support, would be unworkable. This was recently 
confirmed by an evaluation of the organization and staffing for both the Police and Fire 
departments. The evaluations found both departments are understaffed, but the understaffing 
situation is significantly more acute in the Police Department, where it was noted that comparable 
cities have on average 1 00 more officers on the street than Flint does. 



Governor Snyder 
April 28. 2015

* Equally important to providing State support in the Form of Michigan State Police has been the 
financial commitment by the State to Fund tire City’s lock up at a cost of more than $2.5 million 
annually - without which there would be no lock-up. Both FPD and MSP have noted that the 
opening of the City’s 72-hour lock-up has been a key component in the reduction in crime. 

Emergency Manager’s Recommendation: 

Section 22(1) of P.A. 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, provides that if the 
Emergency Manager determines that the financial emergency has been rectified, he or she is required to 
inform you and the State Treasurer. Based on the examples presented above, 1 am prepared to say that 1 
have determined the financial emergency in the City of Flint has been rectified. In addition, as required by 
Section 21(1) of the Act, a two-year budget has been implemented and all bargaining unit contracts have 
been settled. 

Although the financial emergency has been resolved, i recommend the appointment of a Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board (RTAB) as allowed by Section 23 of the Act, 1 believe it is critical that the 
RTAB oversee and provide guidance to the City as they address the continuing challenges facing the City 
of Flint and complete transition back to full local control. 

The path to sustainable financial solvency for the City of Flint will be very difficult, but doable. The new 
financial policies and practices, and the new organizational structure, are designed to assist City leaders in 
achieving this goal. Achieving the goal will allow City leaders to become a positive force in leading the 
City to become an attractive place to live, work, study, and play. I applaud the efforts of the Mayor and 
Council members who have worked actively and positively to effectuate these changes and are committed 
to carrying them into the future. 

If, however, the new policies, practices, and organizational changes are ignored in favor of returning to the 
historic ways of doing business, it is not likely the City will succeed over the long term. The focus of City 
leaders will then likely once again return to confronting financial insolvency. 

1 have greatly appreciated the opportunity to have been of service to the City of Flint and to the State of 
Michigan. 


Sincerely, 



Emergency Manager 
City of Flint

Secretary Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, Administrator Fugate and Director Frieden: 

Recent developments regarding the level of lead in the water in one of the communities I 
represent, Flint, Mich., have raised significant concerns about the safety of its drinking water. 

For this reason, I am requesting immediate resources to provide safe drinking water to the 
residents of Flint until additional testing can be completed that confirms the water is safe, 
particularly for young children. 

Although the city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have 
conducted tests and taken the position that the lead level in the water is safe and below the action 
level, there are significant questions about the efficacy of their testing. In fact. Dr. Marc Edwards 
of Virginia Tech University, an established drinking water expert, conducted his own tests as 
part of a study that determined the water in Flint was above the lead action level. 

Additionally, yesterday the Greater Flint Health Coalition, a group ofhealth professionals in the 
community, released a report showing elevated blood lead levels in residents in Flint, 
particularly in young children. In response, the Coalition has requested that the Genesee County 
Health Department release a health advisory indicating that the water in Flint is unsafe to drink.

Dear Representative Kildee: 

This is in response to your letter of September 22, 2015, to Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) Administrator Craig Fugate, as well as the ITS, Department of Health and 
Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection 
Agency. You requested federal assistance to provide safe drinking water to residents of the City 
of Flint, Michigan, until additional testing confirms that the water is safe. Administrator Fugate 
requested that I respond to you because Michigan is within FEMA Region V. 

As you may be aware, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 
Public Law 93-288, as amended, authorizes FEMA to provide federal assistance to a state after 
the governor requests that the president issue a disaster declaration and the president approves 
the request because if has been determined that the severity and magnitude of the incident 
exceeds local, tribal and state capabilities. If providing safe water to its residents is beyond tire 
city’s capability, the city, through Genesee County Emergency Management should contact the 
Michigan State Police Di vision of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. However, 
in this situation, it may be more expedient and practical to pursue water sources from other local 
or private sector entities. 


If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact me or have a member 
of your staff contact my Congressional Affairs Specialist, Dan Shiftman, at (312) 408-4427,

Hey, Dan! 

Hope you're going well; Merry Christmas! 

This showed up on my Facebook page, from some good friends who happen to be wild left-wing Democrats... It's 
allegedly from a Colorado paper. Is it for real?? 

Here's the content... 


" Jesper Nymund 

December 24 at 3:01 am • Denver, CO ■ 

Breaking news: beleaguered Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has told his fellow Michiganders to "take a deep breath" and 
accept that the deliberate and sustained lead poisoning of the drinking water for the city of Flint was a "long term and 
structural investment" in the human infrastructure of the economically depressed and predominantly African American 
urban area. 


In an interview with Stuart Varney on Fox Business Network Governor Snyder explained that the brain damage and anti- 
social behaviors associated with early childhood lead poisoning would "pay dividends" further down the road. 




"My administration is very business friendly and incarceration for profit is one of those growth industries where we in the 
public sector can do the most good for our partners in the business community. It may take a decade or so before the 
toddlers sustaining brain damage today can be tried as adults and sentenced to long and profitable prison terms. But just 
to let you know how committed I am to this speculation in lead poisoning, Stuart, I can assure you that my personal 
portfolio is heavily invested in the prison industry!" 

Asked by Stuart Varney if the brain damage inflicted on Michigan's African American population might lend "further 
credence" to political scientists like Charles Murray who have suggested that lower scores on intelligence tests by various 
ethnic groups might be genetically based Governor Snyder exhibited winsome modesty in declining to take credit. 

"I couldn't possibly claim to have influenced the science on the issue, Stuart. In all Republican administrations, including 
my own, it is simply assumed that African Americans are naturally inferior in all fields except pro sports and rap music. To 
the extent our little experiment with heavy metal -- if you'll permit me a moment of levity! -- has helped to accentuate the 
natural state of affairs I'll regard that as a fringe benefit." 


That's it, Dan; I can't believe it's real -- but is it?? 

Please let me know, so I can (hopefully) correct the record with my friends... 


God bless --

Smart way to handle this. The Milliken administration had a similar problem. PBB, a fire retardant got mixed in with 
cattle feed and cows got very sick. Folks didn't know what was happening and once they discovered the problem a 
question of human health was raised. A major environmental and political problem. Milliken's Ag Director was slow and 
had some internal documents he didn't share. They had to buy the cattle - thousands - and dispose of them. I may 
have some of my recall a bit fuzzy at this hour of the morning, but it was a similar problem - government action or 
inaction and the response. You just have to move forward and be proactive in the decision making. Governors as 
leaders have to provide the leadership. 

I mentioned to a friend this week when we were discussing this Flint issue that I had recalled the PBB issue of the 
Milliken administration and the quicker the Governor acts the better. 

Hope you and the family had a nice Christmas and wishing you the best: for the New Year.

Wyant Resigns In Wake Of Flint Water Crisis 

Department of Environmental Quality Director Dan Wyant has resigned in response to the water crisis that 
erupted three months ago in Flint. 

“MDEQ Director Dan Wyant has offered his resignation, and I’ve determined that it’s appropriate to accept it. 
I’m also making other personnel changes at MDEQ to address problems cited by the task force,” Governor Rick 
Snyder said in a statement. 

“But changes in leadership and staff are not enough. I understand there can be disagreements within the 
scientific community. That is why I have directed both the departments of Environmental Quality and Health 
and Human Services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping 
us improve Flint water,” Mr. Snyder said. “Let’s share research on water and blood lead level testing so we can 
arrive at accurate and mutually supported conclusions. Together, we should work to affirm that we’re using the 
very best testing protocols to ensure Flint residents have safe drinking water and that we’re taking steps to 
protect their health over the short and long term.” 

The DEQ has come under major criticism for how it handled testing for lead in Flint drinking water after the 
city switched to the Flint River as its water source. The water was not properly treated for corrosion, causing 
lead to leach from service lines into the drinking water. 

“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened. And I want all Michigan 
citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging 
infrastructure,” Mr. Snyder said. “I know many Flint citizens are angry and want more than an apology. That’s 
why I’m taking the actions today to ensure a culture of openness and trust. We’ve already allocated $10 million 
to test the water, distribute water filters, and help in other ways. Last week, I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, 
and we’re going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance.”
